Alignment of BHS with WLC had been worked out in file "final-mapping-data.csv".

Relate "BHSsort" / "WLCsort" to the text of BHS / WLC in template files, "<a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenHebrewBible/blob/master/000-mapping-template/BHSA_mappingTemplate.csv.zip'>BHSA_mappingTemplate.csv</a>" & "<a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenHebrewBible/blob/master/000-mapping-template/WLC_mappingTemplate.csv.zip'>WLC_mappingTemplate.csv</a>"

With this set of mapping data, users can easily transfer features among databases based on the text of BHS and that of WLC.

We will demonstrate with some examples in the rest of this repository.
