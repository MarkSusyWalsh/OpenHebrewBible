In addition to original Strong's no from OpenScripture / Berean project, we will work out an extended version.
Some Hebrew words are not tagged in OpenScripture / Berean project, we tag those words with data from this repository: <a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/BHS-Strong-no'>https://github.com/eliranwong/BHS-Strong-no</a>.

We provide 2 files here:

1) BHS-with-Strong-no.csv [original OpenScriptures Strong's numbers with Berean project]
2) BHS-with-Strong-no-extended.csv [supplment Strong's numbers, which are missing in BHS-with-Strong-no.csv]

In our extended version of Strong's numbers:<br>
- <a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenHebrewBible/blob/master/002-BHS-with-Strong-no/working-files/supplement.csv'>We worked out 356 Strong's numbers for 356 words in the text of BHSA</a>, which are not tagged in the original OpenScriptures / Berean project
- Many Hebrew words (various forms of lexeme <heb>מִן</heb>) are not tagged in OpenScriptures / Berean projects.  These words are given Strong's number H4480 in the extended version.
- In addition, a total of 121077 words are tagged with extended entries: H9003, H9004, H9005, H9008, H9000, H9009.<br>
