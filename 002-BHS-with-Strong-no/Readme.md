Apply data from <a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenHebrewBible/blob/master/001-aligning-BHS-WLC/final-mapping-data.csv'>https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenHebrewBible/blob/master/001-aligning-BHS-WLC/final-mapping-data.csv</a> to align the text of BHS with OpenScriptures Strong's numbers.

In addition to original Strong's no from OpenScripture / Berean project, we will work out an extended version.
Some Hebrew words are not tagged in OpenScripture / Berean project, we tag those words with data from this repository: <a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/BHS-Strong-no'>https://github.com/eliranwong/BHS-Strong-no</a>.

We provide 2 files here:

1) BHS-with-Strong-no.csv [original OpenScriptures Strong's numbers with Berean project]
2) BHS-with-Strong-no-extended.csv [supplment Strong's numbers, which are missing in BHS-with-Strong-no.csv]

<b>Remarks:</b>
In our extended version of Strong's numbers, six extended entries are not found in original Strong's number conventions.<br>
They are H9003, H9004, H9005, H9008, H9000, H9009.<br>
