c1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
c2	Now the earth was formless and void,
c3	and darkness was over the surface of the deep.
c4	And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.
c5	And God said,
c6	“Let there be light,”
c7	and there was light.
c8	And seeing ... the light
c9	that ... [was] good,
c10	God separated the light from the darkness.
c11	God called the light “day,”
c12	and the darkness He called “night.”
c13	And there was evening,
c14	and there was morning—
c15	the first day.
c16	And God said,
c17	“Let there be an expanse between the waters,
c18	to separate the waters from the waters.”
c19	So God made the expanse
c20	and separated the waters
c21	beneath [it]
c22	from the waters
c23	above.
c24	And it was so.
c25	God called the expanse “sky.”
c26	evening,
c27	And there was ... and [there was] morning—
c28	the second day.
c29	And God said,
c30	“Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place,
c31	so that the dry [land] may appear.”
c32	And it was so.
c33	God called the dry [land] “earth,”
c34	and the collection of waters He called “seas.”
c35	And God saw
c36	that [it was] good.
c37	Then God said,
c38	“Let the earth bring forth vegetation, ... plants
c39	seed-bearing
c40	and fruit trees,
c41	each bearing fruit ... according to its kind.”
c42	with seed
c44	And it was so.
c45	The earth produced vegetation, ... plants
c46	seed-bearing ... according to their kinds
c47	and trees
c48	bearing fruit
c49	with seed
c50	according to their kinds.
c51	And God saw
c52	that it was good.
c53	And there was evening,
c54	and there was morning—
c55	the third day.
c56	And God said,
c57	“Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky
c58	to distinguish between day and night
c59	and to mark [the] seasons and days and years,
c60	and let them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky
c61	to shine upon the earth.”
c62	And it was so.
c63	God made two great lights:
c64	the greater light to rule the day
c65	and the lesser light to rule the night.
c66	And [He made] the stars {as well}.
c67	God set [these lights] in the expanse of the sky
c68	to shine upon the earth,
c69	to preside over the day and the night,
c70	and to separate the light from the darkness.
c71	And God saw
c72	that [it was] good.
c73	And there was evening,
c74	and there was morning—
c75	the fourth day.
c76	And God said,
c77	“Let the waters teem with living creatures,
c78	and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.”
c79	So God created the great sea creatures and every ... thing
c80	living
c81	that moves,
c82	[with] which the waters teemed
c83	according to their kinds,
c84	and every bird of flight after its kind.
c85	And God saw
c86	that [it was] good.
c87	Then God blessed them
c88	[and] said,
c89	“Be fruitful
c90	and multiply
c91	and fill the waters of the seas,
c92	and let birds multiply on the earth.”
c93	And there was evening,
c94	and there was morning—
c95	the fifth day.
c96	And God said,
c97	“Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds:
c98	livestock, land crawlers, and wild animals according to their kinds.”
c99	And it was so.
c100	God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds,
c101	the livestock according to their kinds,
c102	and everything that crawls upon the earth according to its kind.
c103	And God saw
c104	that [it was] good.
c105	Then God said,
c106	“Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness,
c107	to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, and over all the earth itself and every creature
c108	that crawls upon [it].”
c109	So God created man in His [own] image;
c110	in the image of God He created him;
c111	male and female He created them.
c112	God blessed them
c113	and said to them,
c114	“Be fruitful
c115	and multiply,
c116	and fill the earth
c117	and subdue it;
c118	rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature
c119	that crawls upon the earth.”
c120	Then God said,
c121	“Behold, I have given you every ... plant
c122	seed-bearing
c123	on the face of all the earth,
c124	and every tree
c125	whose fruit
c126	contains seed.
c127	They will be yours for food.
c128	And to every beast of the earth and every bird of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth—
c129	everything that has the breath of life
c130	in it— [I have given] every green plant for food.”
c131	And it was so.
c132	And God looked upon all
c133	that He had made,
c134	and indeed, [it was] very good.
c135	And there was evening,
c136	and there was morning—
c137	the sixth day.
c138	Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
c139	And by the seventh day God had finished the work
c140	He had been doing;
c141	so on [that] day He rested from all His work.
c143	Then God blessed the seventh day
c144	and sanctified it,
c145	because on [that day] He rested from all the work
c146	of creation that [He]
c147	had accomplished.
c148	This [is] the account of the heavens and the earth
c149	when they were created,
c150	in the day
c151	that the LORD God made [them].
c152	Now [no] shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth,
c153	nor had any plant of the field sprouted;
c154	for the LORD God had not [yet] sent rain upon the earth,
c155	and [there was] no man
c156	to cultivate the ground.
c157	But springs welled up from the earth
c158	and watered the whole surface of the ground.
c159	Then the LORD God formed man [from] the dust of the ground
c160	and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils,
c161	and the man became a living being.
c162	And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east,
c163	where He placed the man
c164	He had formed.
c165	Out of the ground the LORD God gave growth to every tree
c166	that is pleasing to the eye
c167	and good for food.
c168	And in the middle of the garden [were] the tree of life
c169	and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
c170	Now a river flowed out of Eden
c171	to water the garden,
c172	and from there it branched into
c173	four headwaters:
c174	The name of the first [river] [is] Pishon;
c175	it
c176	winds through the whole land of Havilah,
c177	where there [is] gold.
c178	And the gold of that land [is] pure,
c179	[and] bdellium and onyx [are found] there.
c180	The name of the second river [is] Gihon;
c181	it
c182	winds through the whole land of Cush.
c183	The name of the third river [is] Hiddekel;
c184	it
c185	runs along the east side of Assyria.
c186	And the fourth river
c187	[is the] Euphrates.
c188	Then the LORD God took the man
c189	and placed him in the Garden of Eden
c190	to cultivate
c191	and keep it.
c192	And the LORD God commanded [him],
c194	“You may eat freely from every tree of the garden,
c195	from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil;
c196	but you must not eat
c197	for in the day
c198	that you eat of it,
c199	you will surely die.”
c200	The LORD God also said,
c201	“[It is] not good
c202	for the man to be alone.
c203	I will make for him a suitable helper.”
c204	And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air,
c205	and He brought [them] to the man
c206	to see
c207	what he would name
c208	each one.
c209	And whatever the man called each living creature,
c210	that [was] its name.
c211	The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field.
c212	But for Adam no suitable helper was found.
c213	So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep,
c214	and while he slept,
c215	He took one of [the man’s] ribs
c216	and closed up the area with flesh.
c217	And from the rib ... the LORD God ... He made
c218	that ... had taken from the man,
c219	a woman
c220	and brought her to [him].
c221	And the man said:
c222	“This [is] now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh;
c223	she shall be called ‘woman,’
c224	for out of man she was taken.”
c225	For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother
c226	be united to his wife,
c227	and ... and they will become one flesh.
c228	And the man and his wife were both naked,
c229	and they were not ashamed.
c230	Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field
c231	that the LORD God had made.
c232	And he said to the woman,
c233	“Did God really say,
c234	‘You must not eat of any tree in the garden?’”
c235	The woman answered the serpent,
c236	“We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden,
c237	but of the fruit of the tree
c238	in the middle of the garden,
c239	God has said,
c240	‘You must not eat of it
c241	[or] touch it,
c242	[or] you will die.’”
c243	the serpent told [her].
c244	“You will not surely die,”
c245	“For God knows
c246	that in the day
c247	you eat of it,
c248	your eyes ... opened
c249	will be ... and you will be like God,
c250	knowing good and evil.”
c251	When the woman saw
c252	that the tree [was] good for food
c253	and pleasing to the eyes,
c254	[and that it was] desirable
c255	for obtaining wisdom,
c256	she took the fruit
c257	and ate it.
c258	She also gave [some] to her husband,
c259	and he ate it.
c260	And the eyes of both of them were opened,
c261	knew
c262	and they ... that they [were] naked;
c263	so they sewed together fig leaves
c264	and made coverings for themselves.
c265	heard the voice of the LORD God
c266	walking in the garden in the breeze of the day,
c267	Then the man and his wife ... and they hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
c268	So the LORD God called out to the man,
c270	“Where [are] you?”
c271	he replied,
c272	“I heard Your voice in the garden,”
c273	“and I was afraid
c274	because I [was] naked;
c275	so I hid myself.”
c276	asked the LORD God.
c277	“Who told
c278	you that you [were] naked?”
c279	of the tree
c280	from which I commanded you
c281	“Have you eaten ... not to
c282	eat?”
c283	And the man answered,
c284	“The woman
c285	whom You gave me,
c286	she gave me [fruit] from the tree,
c287	and I ate it.”
c288	Then the LORD God said to the woman,
c289	“What [is] this you have done?”
c290	[she] replied,
c291	“The serpent deceived me,”
c292	“and I ate.”
c293	So the LORD God said to the serpent:
c294	“Because you have done this,
c295	cursed are you above all livestock and every beast of the field!
c296	On your belly {will} you go,
c297	and dust you {will} eat, all the days of your life.
c298	And I will put enmity between [you] and the woman, and between your seed and her seed.
c299	He {will} crush your head,
c300	and you {will} strike his heel.”
c301	To the woman He said:
c302	“I will sharply increase your pain in childbirth;
c303	in pain you will bring forth children.
c304	Your desire [will be] for your husband,
c305	and he {will} rule over you.”
c306	And to Adam He said:
c307	“Because you have listened to the voice of your wife
c308	and have eaten of the tree
c309	from which I commanded
c311	you not to eat
c312	,cursed [is] the ground because of you;
c313	through toil you will eat [of] it all the days of your life.
c314	Both thorns and thistles it {will} yield you,
c315	and you {will} eat the plants of the field.
c316	By the sweat of your brow you will eat [your] bread,
c317	until you return to the ground—
c318	because out of it were you taken.
c319	For dust you [are],
c320	and to dust you {shall} return.”
c321	And Adam named his wife Eve,
c322	because she would become the mother of all the living.
c323	The LORD God made garments of skin ... Adam and his wife.
c324	and clothed
c325	Then the LORD God said,
c326	“Behold, the man has become like one of Us,
c327	knowing good and evil.
c328	And now,
c329	lest he reach out his hand
c330	and take also from the tree of life,
c331	and eat,
c332	and live forever”
c333	Therefore the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden
c334	to work the ground
c335	from which he had been taken.
c336	So He drove out the man
c337	and stationed cherubim to the east of the Garden of Eden, with ... sword of flame
c338	a whirling
c339	to guard the way to the tree of life.
c340	And Adam had relations with his wife Eve,
c341	and she conceived
c342	and gave birth to Cain.
c343	she said.
c344	“With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,”
c345	Later
c346	she gave birth to [Cain’s] brother Abel.
c347	Now Abel ... a keeper of sheep,
c348	was ... but Cain was a tiller of the soil.
c349	So in the course of time,
c350	Cain brought some of the fruit of the soil as an offering to the LORD,
c351	while Abel brought the best portions of the firstborn of his flock.
c352	And the LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,
c353	but He had no regard for Cain and his offering.
c354	So Cain became very angry,
c355	and his countenance fell.
c356	said the LORD to Cain,“
c357	“Why are you angry,”
c358	and why is your face downcast?
c359	{will}
c360	If you do what is right,
c361	be accepted?
c362	you not ... But if you refuse to do what is right,
c363	sin is crouching at your door;
c364	you are its object of desire,
c365	but you must master it.”
c366	Then Cain said to his brother Abel, [“Let us go out to the field.”]
c367	And
c368	while they were in the field,
c369	Cain rose up against his brother Abel
c370	and killed him.
c371	And the LORD said to Cain,
c372	“Where [is] your brother Abel?”
c373	he answered.
c374	do not know!”
c375	“I ... “[Am] I my brother’s keeper?”
c376	replied [the LORD].
c377	“What have you done?”
c378	“The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.
c379	Now
c380	you [are] cursed and banished from the ground,
c381	which has opened its mouth
c382	to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
c383	When you till the ground,
c384	{it will} no longer
c385	yield its produce to you.
c386	You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”
c387	But Cain said to the LORD,
c388	“My punishment [is] greater
c389	than I can bear.
c390	Behold, this day You have driven me from the face of the earth, and from
c391	Your face I will be hidden;
c392	I {will} be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth,
c393	and
c394	whoever
c395	finds me
c396	{will} kill me.”
c397	replied the LORD
c398	“Not so!”
c399	“If anyone slays Cain, [then Cain] will be avenged sevenfold.”
c400	And the LORD placed a mark on Cain,
c401	so that no one who found him would kill him.
c402	So Cain went out from the presence of the LORD
c403	and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
c404	And Cain had relations with his wife,
c405	and she conceived
c406	and gave birth to Enoch.
c407	Then
c408	[Cain] built a city
c409	and named [it] after his son Enoch.
c410	Now to Enoch was born Irad,
c411	and Irad was the father of Mehujael,
c412	and Mehujael was the father of Methusael,
c413	and Methusael was the father of Lamech.
c414	And Lamech married two women,
c415	one named Adah
c416	and the other Zillah.
c417	And Adah gave birth to Jabal;
c418	he was the father of those who dwell in tents and [raise] livestock.
c419	And his brother’s name [was] Jubal;
c420	he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.
c421	Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-cain,
c422	a forger of every implement of bronze and iron.
c423	And the sister of Tubal-cain [was] Naamah.
c424	Then Lamech said to his wives: “Adah and Zillah,
c425	hear my voice;
c426	wives of Lamech,
c427	listen to my speech.
c428	For I have slain [a man] for wounding me,
c429	a young man for striking me.
c430	If Cain is avenged sevenfold,
c431	then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”
c432	And Adam again had relations with his wife,
c433	and she gave birth to a son
c434	and named him Seth,
c435	saying, “God has granted me another seed in place of Abel,
c436	since Cain killed him.”
c437	And to Seth also a son was born,
c438	and he called him Enosh.
c439	At that time [men] began
c440	to call upon the name of the LORD.
c441	This [is] the book of the generations of Adam.
c442	In the day
c443	that God created man,
c444	He made him in His own likeness.
c445	Male and female He created them,
c446	and He blessed them.
c447	And in the day ... He called them “man.”
c448	they were created,
c449	When Adam was 130 years old,
c450	he had a son in his own likeness, after his own image;
c451	and he named him Seth.
c452	Adam lived
c453	And after he had become the father of Seth,
c454	800 years
c455	and had [other] sons and daughters.
c456	So Adam lived a total of
c458	930 years,
c459	and then he died.
c460	When Seth was 105 years old,
c461	he became the father of Enosh.
c462	Seth lived
c463	And after he had become the father of Enosh,
c464	807 years
c465	and had [other] sons and daughters.
c466	So Seth lived a total of 912 years,
c467	and then he died.
c468	When Enosh was 90 years old,
c469	he became the father of Kenan.
c470	Enosh lived
c471	And after he had become the father of Kenan,
c472	815 years
c473	and had [other] sons and daughters.
c474	So Enosh lived a total of 905 years,
c475	and then he died.
c476	When Kenan was 70 years old,
c477	he became the father of Mahalaleel.
c478	Kenan lived
c479	And after he had become the father of Mahalaleel,
c480	840 years
c481	and had [other] sons and daughters.
c482	So Kenan lived a total of 910 years,
c483	and then he died.
c484	When Mahalaleel was 65 years old,
c485	he became the father of Jared.
c486	Mahalaleel lived
c487	And after he had become the father of Jared,
c488	830 years
c489	and had [other] sons and daughters.
c490	So Mahalaleel lived a total of 895 years,
c491	and then he died.
c492	When Jared was 162 years old,
c493	he became the father of Enoch.
c494	Jared lived
c495	And after he had become the father of Enoch,
c496	800 years
c497	and had [other] sons and daughters.
c498	So Jared lived a total of 962 years,
c499	and then he died.
c500	When Enoch was 65 years old,
c501	he became the father of Methuselah.
c502	Enoch walked with God
c503	And after he had become the father of Methuselah,
c504	300 years
c505	and had [other] sons and daughters.
c506	So Enoch lived a total of 365 years.
c507	Enoch walked with God,
c508	and then he [was] no more,
c509	because God had taken him {away}.
c510	When Methuselah was 187 years old,
c511	he became the father of Lamech.
c512	Methuselah lived
c513	And after he had become the father of Lamech,
c514	782 years
c515	and had [other] sons and daughters.
c516	So Methuselah lived a total of 969 years,
c517	and then he died.
c518	When Lamech was 182 years old,
c519	he had a son.
c520	And he named him Noah,
c521	saying,
c522	“{May} this one comfort us in the labor and toil of our hands caused by the ground
c523	that the LORD has cursed.”
c524	Lamech lived
c525	And after he had become the father of Noah,
c526	595 years
c527	and had [other] sons and daughters.
c528	So Lamech lived a total of 777 years,
c529	and then he died.
c530	Noah was 500 years old,
c531	After ... [he] became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
c532	Now
c533	when men began
c534	to multiply on the face of the earth
c535	and daughters were born to them,
c536	the sons of God saw that the daughters of men
c537	[were] beautiful,
c538	and they took as wives
c539	whomever they chose.
c540	So the LORD said,
c541	“My Spirit {will} not contend with man forever,
c542	for he [is] mortal;
c543	his days {shall} be 120 years.”
c544	The Nephilim were on the earth in those days,
c545	and afterward as well,
c546	when the sons of God had relations with the daughters of men.
c547	And they bore them
c548	[children] who [became] the mighty men
c549	of old,
c550	men of renown.
c551	Then the LORD saw
c552	that the wickedness of man [was] great upon the earth,
c553	and [that] every inclination of the thoughts of his heart [was] altogether evil all the time.
c554	And the LORD regretted
c555	that He had made man on the earth,
c556	and it grieved Him in His heart.
c557	So the LORD said,
c558	“I will blot out man,
c559	whom I have created,
c560	from the face of the earth— every man and beast and crawling creature and bird of the air—
c561	for I am grieved
c562	that I have made them.”
c563	Noah, however, found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
c564	This [is] the account of Noah.
c565	Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation;
c566	Noah walked with God.
c567	And Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
c568	Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God,
c569	[and] full of violence.
c570	And God looked upon the earth
c571	and saw that it was corrupt;
c572	for all living creatures on the earth had corrupted their ways.
c573	Then God said to Noah,
c574	“The end of all living creatures has come before Me,
c575	because through them the earth is full of violence.
c576	Now behold, I will destroy both them and the earth.
c577	Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood;
c578	make rooms in the ark
c579	and coat it with pitch inside and out.
c580	And this
c581	is how you are to build it:
c582	The ark [is to be] 300 cubits long,
c583	50 cubits wide,
c584	and 30 cubits high.
c585	You are to make a roof for the ark,
c586	finish [its walls] a cubit from the top,
c587	place a door in the side of the ark,
c588	and build lower, middle, and upper {decks}.
c589	And
c590	behold, I will bring floodwaters upon the earth,
c591	to destroy every creature
c592	that has the breath of life.
c593	under the heavens
c594	Everything
c595	on the earth
c596	will perish.
c597	But I will establish My covenant with you,
c598	and you {will} enter the ark— you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.
c599	And ... living thing
c600	you are to bring two of every ... into the ark—
c601	to keep [them] alive with you.
c602	male and female—
c603	of bird and animal [and] crawling creature
c604	Two of every kind ... {will} come to you
c605	to be kept alive.
c606	You are also to take for yourself every kind of food
c607	that is eaten
c608	and gather [it]
c609	as food for yourselves [and] for [the animals].”
c610	So Noah did everything
c611	God had commanded him.
c612	precisely as
c613	Then the LORD said to Noah,
c614	“Go into the ark, you and all your family,
c615	because I have found you righteous in this generation.
c616	You {are to} take with you seven of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate,
c617	of ... animal,
c618	[every kind of] unclean
c619	[and] two ... a male and its mate,
c620	and also seven of [every kind of] bird of the air, male and female,
c621	in order to preserve their offspring on the face of all the earth.
c622	For seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights,
c623	and I will wipe ... every living thing
c624	I have made.”
c625	from the face of the earth
c626	And Noah did all
c627	that the LORD had commanded him.
c628	Now Noah was 600 years old
c629	when the floodwaters came
c630	upon the earth.
c631	And Noah entered the ark, along with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives, to escape the waters of the flood.
c632	[The] clean and ... animals,
c633	unclean
c634	the birds, and everything
c635	that crawls along the ground
c636	came to Noah to enter the ark, two by two, male and female,
c637	as God had commanded [him].
c638	And after seven days
c639	the floodwaters came upon the earth.
c640	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month, all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and
c641	the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
c642	And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
c643	On that very day Noah entered the ark, [along with his] sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and [his] wife, and the three wives of his sons—
c644	they and every kind of wild animal, livestock, crawling creature,
c646	bird, and winged creature.
c647	They came to Noah to enter the ark, two by two of every creature
c648	with the breath of life.
c650	And they entered,
c651	the male and female of every living thing,
c652	as God had commanded [Noah].
c653	Then the LORD shut him in.
c654	For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth,
c655	and the waters rose
c656	and lifted the ark
c657	high above the earth.
c658	So the waters continued to surge
c659	and rise greatly on the earth,
c660	and the ark floated on the surface of the waters.
c661	Finally, the waters completely inundated the earth,
c662	so that all the high mountains ... were covered.
c663	under all the heavens
c664	The waters rose ... to a depth of fifteen cubits.
c665	and covered the mountaintops
c666	And every creature ... perished—
c667	that had moved upon the earth
c668	birds, livestock, animals, every creature that swarms
c669	upon the earth,
c670	and all mankind.
c671	everything
c672	that had the breath of life in its nostrils
c673	Of all
c674	that [had been] on dry land,
c675	died.
c676	And every living thing ... was destroyed—
c677	on the face of the earth
c678	man and livestock, crawling creatures and birds of the air;
c679	they were blotted out from the earth,
c680	and only Noah remained,
c681	and those with him in the ark.
c682	And the waters prevailed upon the earth for 150 days.
c683	But God remembered Noah and all the animals and livestock
c684	that were with him in the ark.
c685	And [He] sent a wind over the earth,
c686	and the waters began to subside.
c687	The springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens were closed,
c688	and the rain from the sky was restrained.
c689	The waters receded steadily from the earth,
c690	and after 150 days the waters had gone down.
c691	On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
c692	And the waters continued to recede until the tenth month,
c693	[and] on the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains became visible.
c694	After forty days
c695	Noah opened the window ... in the ark
c696	he had made
c697	and sent out a raven.
c698	It kept flying back and forth
c699	until the waters had dried up from the earth.
c700	Then [Noah] sent out a dove
c701	to see
c702	if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.
c703	But the dove found no place to rest her foot,
c704	and she returned to him in the ark,
c705	because water still covered the surface of the whole earth.
c706	So he reached out his hand
c708	and brought her back inside the ark.
c709	[Noah] waited seven more days
c710	and again
c711	sent out the dove from the ark.
c712	the dove returned to him in the evening
c713	And behold, ... with a freshly plucked olive leaf in her beak.
c714	So Noah knew
c715	that the waters had receded from the earth.
c716	[And] Noah waited seven more days
c717	and sent out the dove {again},
c718	but this time
c719	she did not return to him.
c721	In [Noah’s] six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the water had dried up from the earth.
c722	So Noah removed the covering from the ark
c723	and saw
c724	that the surface of the ground was dry.
c725	By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was fully dry.
c726	Then God said to Noah,
c728	“Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives.
c729	all the living creatures
c730	that are with you—
c731	birds, livestock, and everything
c732	that crawls upon the ground—
c733	Bring out
c734	so that they can spread out over the earth
c735	and be fruitful
c736	and multiply upon [it].”
c737	So Noah came out, along with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.
c738	Every living creature, every creeping thing, and every bird— everything
c739	that moves upon the earth—
c740	came out of the ark, kind by kind.
c741	Then Noah built an altar to the LORD.
c742	Taking from every kind of clean animal and clean bird,
c743	He offered burnt offerings on the altar.
c744	When the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma,
c745	He said in His heart,
c746	“Never again
c747	will I curse the ground because of man,
c748	even though every inclination of [his] heart is evil from his youth.
c749	And never again
c750	will I destroy all living creatures
c751	as I have done.
c752	As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall never cease.”
c753	And God blessed Noah and his sons
c754	and said to them,
c755	“Be fruitful
c756	and multiply
c757	and fill the earth.
c758	The fear and dread of you will fall on every living creature on the earth, every bird of the sky,
c759	every
c760	creature that crawls on the ground,
c761	and all the fish of the sea.
c762	They are delivered into your hand.
c763	Every ... creature
c764	living
c765	will be food for you;
c766	just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you all things.
c767	But you must not eat meat with its lifeblood [still] in it.
c768	And surely I will require ... your lifeblood [is shed].
c769	the life of any ... or beast
c770	man ... by whose hand ... I will demand an accounting from anyone [who takes] the life of his fellow man:
c771	Whoever sheds the blood of man,
c772	by man his blood will be shed;
c773	for in His own image God has made mankind.
c774	But as for you, be fruitful
c775	and multiply;
c776	spread out across the earth
c777	and multiply upon it.”
c778	Then God said to Noah and his sons with him,
c780	I now
c781	“Behold, ... establish My covenant with you and your descendants after you,
c782	and with every living creature
c783	that [was] with you—
c784	the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth—
c785	every
c786	that came out of the ark.
c787	living thing
c788	And I establish My covenant with you:
c789	Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood;
c790	never again will there be a flood
c791	to destroy the earth.”
c792	And God said,
c793	“This is the sign of the covenant
c794	I am making between Me and you and every living creature
c795	with you,
c796	[a covenant] for all generations to come:
c797	I have set My rainbow in the clouds,
c798	and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.
c800	Whenever I form clouds over the earth
c801	and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
c802	I will remember My covenant
c803	between Me and you and all living creatures:
c804	Never again will the waters become a flood
c805	to destroy all life.
c806	And whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds,
c807	I will see it
c808	and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind
c809	that [is] on the earth.”
c810	So God said to Noah,
c811	“This is the sign of the covenant
c812	that I have established between Me and all living things
c813	on the earth.”
c814	The sons of Noah ... were
c815	who came out of the ark
c816	Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
c817	And Ham
c818	was the father of Canaan.
c819	These three were the sons of Noah,
c820	and from them the whole earth was populated.
c821	proceeded
c822	Now Noah, a man of the soil,
c823	to plant a vineyard.
c824	But when he drank some of its wine,
c825	he became drunk
c826	and uncovered himself inside his tent.
c827	Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness
c828	and told his two brothers outside.
c829	Then Shem and Japheth took a garment
c830	and placed it across their shoulders,
c831	and walking backward,
c832	they covered their father’s nakedness.
c833	Their faces were turned away
c834	so that they did not see their father’s nakedness.
c835	When Noah awoke from his drunkenness
c836	and learned
c837	what his youngest son had done to him,
c838	he said,
c839	“Cursed be Canaan!
c840	A servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.”
c841	He also declared:
c842	“Blessed [be] the LORD, the God of Shem!
c843	May Canaan be the servant of [Shem].
c844	{May} God expand the territory of Japheth,
c845	may he dwell in the tents of Shem,
c846	and may Canaan be his servant.”
c847	After the flood, Noah lived 350 years.
c848	So Noah lived a total of 950 years,
c849	and then he died.
c850	This is the account of Noah’s sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth,
c851	who also had sons after the flood.
c852	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
c853	The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
c854	And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
c855	From these, the maritime peoples separated into their territories,
c856	according to their languages,
c857	by clans within their nations.
c858	The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
c859	The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca.
c860	And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
c861	And Cush was the father of Nimrod,
c862	who grew
c863	to be a mighty warrior on the earth.
c864	He was a mighty hunter before the LORD;
c865	so it is said,
c866	“Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.”
c867	His kingdom began in Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
c868	From that land he went forth into Assyria,
c869	where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,
c870	and Resen, which is between Nineveh ... of Calah.
c871	and the great city
c872	And Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites,
c873	the Pathrusites, the Casluhites,
c874	(from whom the Philistines came).
c875	and the Caphtorites
c876	Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,
c877	the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
c878	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
c879	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites.
c880	Later the Canaanite clans were scattered
c881	and the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon
c882	toward Gerar
c883	as far as Gaza,
c884	and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim,
c885	as far as Lasha.
c886	These [are] the sons of Ham according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.
c887	And sons were also born to Shem,
c888	the older brother [of] Japheth; [Shem] was the forefather of all the sons of Eber.
c889	The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
c890	The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
c891	And Arphaxad was the father of Shelah,
c892	and Shelah was the father of Eber.
c893	And two sons were born to Eber:
c894	One was named Peleg,
c895	because in his days the earth was divided,
c896	and his brother was named Joktan.
c897	And Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
c898	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
c899	Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
c900	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab.
c901	All these [were] sons of Joktan.
c902	Their territory ... Mesha
c903	extended from ... to Sephar, in the eastern hill country.
c904	These are the sons of Shem, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.
c905	All these are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their generations and nations.
c906	From these the nations of the earth spread out after the flood.
c907	Now the whole world had one language and a common form of speech.
c908	And
c909	as people journeyed eastward,
c910	they found a plain in the land of Shinar
c911	and settled there.
c912	And they said
c913	to one another,
c914	“Come,
c915	let us make bricks
c916	and bake them thoroughly.”
c917	So they used brick instead of stone,
c918	and tar instead of mortar.
c919	they said,
c920	“Come,”
c921	“let us build for ourselves a city with a tower
c922	that reaches to the heavens,
c923	that we may make a name for ourselves
c924	and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”
c925	Then the LORD came down
c926	to see the city and the tower
c927	that the sons of men were building.
c928	And the LORD said,
c929	“If ... as one people
c930	speaking the same language,
c931	this
c932	they have begun
c933	to do
c934	then nothing ... will be beyond them.
c935	they devise
c937	Come,
c938	let Us go down
c939	and confuse their language,
c940	so that they will not understand
c941	one another’s speech.”
c942	So the LORD scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth,
c943	and they stopped
c944	building the city.
c945	That is why it is called Babel,
c946	for there the LORD confused the language of the whole world,
c947	and from that place the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
c948	This is the account of Shem.
c949	when Shem was 100 years old,
c950	Two years after the flood, ... he became the father of Arphaxad.
c951	Shem lived
c952	And after he had become the father of Arphaxad,
c953	500 years
c954	and had other sons and daughters.
c955	When Arphaxad was 35 years old,
c956	he became the father of Shelah.
c957	Arphaxad lived
c958	And after he had become the father of Shelah,
c959	403 years
c960	and had other sons and daughters.
c961	When Shelah was 30 years old,
c962	he became the father of Eber.
c963	Shelah lived
c964	And after he had become the father of Eber,
c965	403 years
c966	and had other sons and daughters.
c967	When Eber was 34 years old,
c968	he became the father of Peleg.
c969	Eber lived
c970	And after he had become the father of Peleg,
c971	430 years
c972	and had other sons and daughters.
c973	When Peleg was 30 years old,
c974	he became the father of Reu.
c975	Peleg lived
c976	And after he had become the father of Reu,
c977	209 years
c978	and had other sons and daughters.
c979	When Reu was 32 years old,
c980	he became the father of Serug.
c981	Reu lived
c982	And after he had become the father of Serug,
c983	207 years
c984	and had other sons and daughters.
c985	When Serug was 30 years old,
c986	he became the father of Nahor.
c987	Serug lived
c988	And after he had become the father of Nahor,
c989	200 years
c990	and had other sons and daughters.
c991	When Nahor was 29 years old,
c992	he became the father of Terah.
c993	Nahor lived
c994	And after he had become the father of Terah,
c995	119 years
c996	and had other sons and daughters.
c997	When Terah was 70 years old,
c998	he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
c999	This is the account of Terah.
c1000	Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
c1001	And Haran became the father of Lot.
c1002	During his father Terah’s lifetime, Haran died in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
c1003	And Abram and Nahor took wives {for themselves}.
c1004	Abram’s wife was named Sarai,
c1005	and Nahor’s wife was named Milcah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah.
c1006	But Sarai was barren;
c1007	she had no children.
c1008	And Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai the wife of Abram,
c1009	and they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans
c1010	for the land of Canaan.
c1011	But when they arrived in Haran,
c1012	they settled there.
c1013	Terah lived 205 years,
c1014	and he died in Haran.
c1015	Then the LORD said to Abram,
c1016	“Leave your country, your kindred, and your father’s household, and go to the land
c1017	I will show you.
c1018	I will make you into a great nation,
c1019	and I will bless you;
c1020	I will make your name great,
c1021	so that you will be a blessing.
c1022	I will bless those who bless you
c1023	and curse those who curse you;
c1024	and all the families of the earth will be blessed through you.”
c1025	So Abram departed,
c1026	as the LORD had directed him,
c1027	and Lot went with him.
c1028	Abram was seventy-five years old
c1029	when he left Haran.
c1030	And Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all the possessions
c1032	and people
c1033	they had acquired in Haran,
c1034	and set out
c1035	for the land of Canaan.
c1036	When they came to the land of Canaan,
c1037	Abram traveled through the land to the site of the oak of Moreh at Shechem.
c1038	And at that time the Canaanites were in the land.
c1039	Then the LORD appeared to Abram
c1040	and said,
c1041	“I will give this land to your offspring.”
c1042	So [Abram] built an altar there to the LORD,
c1043	who had appeared to him.
c1044	From there [Abram] moved on to the hill country east of Bethel
c1045	and pitched his tent,
c1046	with Bethel to the west
c1047	and Ai to the east.
c1048	There he built an altar to the LORD,
c1049	and he called on the name of the LORD.
c1050	And Abram journeyed on toward the Negev.
c1051	Now there was a famine in the land.
c1052	So Abram went down to Egypt
c1053	to live there for a while
c1054	because the famine was severe.
c1056	As he was about
c1057	to enter Egypt,
c1058	he said to his wife Sarai,
c1059	“Look, I know
c1060	that you [are] a beautiful woman,
c1061	and
c1062	when the Egyptians see you,
c1063	they will say,
c1064	‘This is his wife.’
c1065	Then they will kill me
c1066	but will allow you to live.
c1067	Please say that
c1068	you are my sister,
c1069	so that I will be treated well for your sake,
c1070	and on account of you my life will be spared.”
c1071	So
c1072	when Abram entered Egypt,
c1073	the Egyptians saw ... the woman
c1074	that ... was very beautiful.
c1075	When Pharaoh’s officials saw [Sarai],
c1076	they commended her to [him],
c1077	and she was taken into the palace of Pharaoh.
c1078	He treated Abram well on her account,
c1079	and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, menservants and maidservants, and camels.
c1080	The LORD, however, afflicted Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Abram’s wife Sarai.
c1081	So Pharaoh summoned Abram
c1082	and asked,
c1083	“What have you done to me?
c1084	Why did you not tell
c1085	me she was your wife?
c1086	Why did you say,
c1087	‘She is my sister,’
c1088	so that I took her as my wife?
c1089	Now then, here is your wife.
c1090	Take
c1091	her and go!”
c1092	Then Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning [Abram],
c1093	and they sent him away with his wife and all his possessions.
c1095	So Abram went up out of Egypt ... he and his wife and all his possessions—
c1097	and Lot [was] with him.
c1098	into the Negev—
c1099	And Abram had become extremely wealthy in livestock and silver and gold.
c1100	From the Negev he journeyed from place to place toward Bethel, until he came to the place
c1101	where his tent had formerly been pitched,
c1102	between Bethel and Ai
c1103	to the site ... the altar.
c1104	where he had built ... And there
c1105	Abram called on the name of the LORD.
c1106	Now Lot, ... also
c1107	who was traveling with Abram,
c1108	had flocks and herds and tents.
c1109	But the land was unable to support [both of] them
c1110	while they stayed together,
c1111	for they had so many possessions
c1112	that they were unable
c1113	to coexist.
c1114	And there was discord between the herdsmen of Abram and the herdsmen of Lot.
c1115	At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were also living in the land.
c1116	So Abram said to Lot,
c1117	“Please let there be no contention between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen.
c1118	After all, we are brothers.
c1119	Is not the whole land before you?
c1120	Now separate yourself from me.
c1121	If you go to the left,
c1122	I will go to the right;
c1123	if you go to the right,
c1124	I will go to the left.”
c1125	Lot looked out
c1126	and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan,
c1127	was well watered
c1128	(This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
c1129	like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt.
c1130	all the way to Zoar,
c1131	So Lot chose the whole plain of the Jordan for himself
c1132	[and] set out toward the east.
c1133	And [Abram and Lot] parted
c1134	company.
c1135	Abram lived in the land of Canaan,
c1136	but Lot settled in the cities of the plain
c1137	and pitched [his] tent toward Sodom.
c1138	But the men of Sodom were wicked, sinning greatly against the LORD.
c1139	the LORD said to Abram,
c1140	After Lot had departed,
c1141	“Now lift up your eyes
c1142	from the place ... and look
c1143	where you are,
c1144	to the north and south and east and west.
c1145	For all the land
c1146	that you see,
c1147	I will give to you
c1148	and your offspring forever.
c1149	I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth,
c1150	so that
c1151	if one could
c1152	count the dust of the earth,
c1153	then your offspring could be counted.
c1154	Get up
c1155	and walk around the land, through its length and width—
c1156	for I will give it to you.”
c1157	So Abram moved his tent
c1158	and went
c1159	to live near the oaks of Mamre
c1160	in Hebron,
c1161	where he built an altar to the LORD.
c1162	In those days Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim
c1163	went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela
c1164	(that is, Zoar).
c1165	The latter [five] came as allies to the Valley of Siddim
c1166	(that is, the Salt Sea).
c1167	For twelve years they had been subject to Chedorlaomer,
c1168	but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
c1169	In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings ... went out
c1170	who were allied with him
c1171	and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth-karnaim,
c1172	the Zuzites in Ham,
c1173	the Emites in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
c1174	and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El-paran,
c1175	which [is] near the desert.
c1176	Then they turned back
c1177	to invade En-mishpat
c1178	(that is, Kadesh),
c1179	and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites
c1180	who lived in Hazazon-tamar.
c1181	Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela ... marched out
c1182	(that is, Zoar)
c1183	and arrayed for battle in the Valley of Siddim
c1184	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—
c1185	four kings against five.
c1186	Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits,
c1187	and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled,
c1188	some men fell into [the pits],
c1189	but the survivors fled to the hill country.
c1190	The [four kings] seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food,
c1191	and they went on their way.
c1192	They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions,
c1194	since he was living in Sodom.
c1195	Then an escapee came
c1196	and reported [this] to Abram the Hebrew.
c1197	Now [Abram] was living near the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol [and] Aner,
c1198	all of whom were bound by treaty to Abram.
c1199	And when Abram heard
c1200	that his relative had been captured,
c1201	he assembled the 318 trained men born in his household,
c1202	and they set out in pursuit as far as Dan.
c1203	During the night, [Abram] divided his forces
c1204	and routed [Chedorlaomer’s army],
c1205	pursuing them as far as Hobah,
c1206	north of Damascus.
c1207	He retrieved all the goods,
c1208	as well as his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the rest of the people.
c1209	and the kings ... of Sodom went out
c1210	to meet
c1211	After Abram returned
c1212	from defeating Chedorlaomer ... the king
c1213	allied with him,
c1214	him in the Valley of Shaveh
c1215	(that is, the King’s Valley).
c1216	Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine—
c1217	since he was priest of God Most High—
c1218	and he blessed [Abram]
c1219	and said:
c1220	“Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
c1221	and blessed be God Most High,
c1222	who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”
c1223	Then Abram gave [Melchizedek] a tenth of everything.
c1224	The king of Sodom said to Abram,
c1225	“Give me the people,
c1226	but take the goods for yourself.”
c1227	But Abram replied to the king of Sodom,
c1228	“I have raised my hand to the LORD God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
c1229	that ... even a thread, or a strap of a sandal,
c1230	I will not accept ... or anything
c1231	that belongs to you,
c1232	lest you should say,
c1233	‘I {have made} Abram rich.’
c1234	I will accept nothing
c1235	but
c1236	what my men have eaten
c1237	and the share for the men
c1238	who went with me—
c1239	Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre.
c1240	They may take their portion.”
c1241	After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision:
c1243	“Do not be afraid,
c1244	Abram.
c1245	I [am] your shield,
c1246	your very great reward.”
c1247	But Abram replied,
c1248	“O Lord GOD,
c1249	what can You give me,
c1250	since I remain childless,
c1251	and the heir of my house
c1252	is Eliezer of Damascus?”
c1253	Abram continued,
c1254	“Behold, You have given me no offspring,
c1255	so a servant in my household will be my heir.”
c1256	Then the word of the LORD came to him,
c1257	saying,
c1258	“This one will not be your heir,
c1259	but
c1260	who comes from your own body
c1261	one ... will be your heir.”
c1262	And [the LORD] took him outside
c1263	and said,
c1264	“Now look to the heavens
c1265	and count the stars,
c1266	if you are able.”
c1268	Then He declared,
c1269	“So {shall} your offspring be.”
c1270	Abram believed the LORD,
c1271	and it was credited to him as righteousness.
c1272	[The LORD] also told him,
c1273	“I am the LORD,
c1274	who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans
c1275	to give you this land
c1276	to possess.”
c1277	But [Abram] replied,
c1278	“Lord GOD,
c1279	how can I know
c1280	that I will possess it?”
c1281	And [the LORD] said to him,
c1282	“Bring Me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, [each] three years old, along with a turtledove and a young pigeon.”
c1283	So [Abram] brought all these to Him,
c1284	split each of them down the middle,
c1285	and laid the halves ... each
c1286	opposite ... other.
c1287	The birds, however, he did not cut.
c1288	And the birds of prey descended on the carcasses,
c1289	but Abram drove them away.
c1290	As the sun was
c1291	setting,
c1292	Abram fell into a deep sleep,
c1293	and suddenly great terror and darkness overwhelmed him.
c1294	Then the LORD said to Abram,
c1295	“Know for certain
c1296	that your descendants will be strangers in a land
c1297	that is not their own;
c1298	they will be enslaved
c1299	and mistreated four hundred years.
c1300	But ... the nation
c1301	they serve as slaves,
c1302	I will judge
c1303	and afterward they will depart with many possessions.
c1304	You, however, will go to your fathers in peace
c1305	and be buried at a ripe old age.
c1306	In the fourth generation [your descendants] will return here,
c1307	for the iniquity of the Amorites [is] not yet complete.”
c1308	had fallen,
c1309	When the sun had set
c1310	and darkness
c1311	behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch
c1312	appeared and passed between the halves [of the carcasses].
c1313	On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram,
c1314	saying,
c1315	“To your descendants I have given this land— from the river of Egypt to the great River Euphrates—
c1316	the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
c1317	Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,
c1318	Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
c1319	Now Abram’s wife Sarai had not borne a child to him,
c1320	but she had an Egyptian maidservant
c1321	named Hagar.
c1322	So Sarai said to Abram,
c1323	“Look now, the LORD has prevented me
c1324	from bearing children.
c1325	Please go to my maidservant;
c1326	perhaps I can build a family by her.”
c1327	Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
c1328	So after ... for ten years, [his] wife Sarai took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar
c1329	had lived in Canaan ... to Abram
c1330	[he] ... and gave her ... to be his wife.
c1331	And he slept with Hagar,
c1332	and she conceived.
c1333	But when [Hagar] realized
c1334	that she was pregnant,
c1335	she began to despise her mistress.
c1336	Then Sarai said to Abram,
c1337	“May the wrong done to me [be] upon you!
c1338	I delivered my servant into your arms,
c1339	and ever since she saw
c1340	that she was pregnant,
c1341	she has treated me with contempt.
c1342	May the LORD judge between you and me.”
c1343	said Abram,
c1344	“Here,” ... “your servant is in your hands.
c1345	Do
c1346	whatever you want with her.”
c1347	Then Sarai treated
c1348	[Hagar] so harshly that she fled from her.
c1349	Now the Angel of the LORD found [Hagar] by a spring of water in the desert— the spring along the road to Shur.
c1350	He said,
c1351	“Hagar, servant of Sarai,”
c1352	“where have you come from,
c1353	and where are you going?”
c1354	she replied.
c1355	“I am running away from my mistress Sarai,”
c1356	So the Angel of the LORD told her,
c1357	“Return to your mistress
c1358	and submit to her authority.”
c1359	Then the Angel added,
c1360	“I will greatly multiply your offspring
c1361	so that they will be too numerous to count.”
c1362	The Angel of the LORD proceeded:
c1363	“Behold, you have conceived
c1364	and will bear a son.
c1365	And you shall name him Ishmael,
c1366	for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction.
c1367	He will be a wild donkey [of a] man,
c1368	and his hand will be against everyone,
c1369	and everyone’s hand against him;
c1370	he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.”
c1371	So [Hagar] gave this name to the LORD
c1372	who had spoken to her:
c1373	“You are the God who sees me,”
c1374	for she said,
c1375	“Here I have seen
c1376	the One who sees me!”
c1377	Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi.
c1378	It is located between Kadesh and Bered.
c1379	And Hagar bore Abram a son,
c1380	and Abram gave the name ... to the son
c1381	[she] had borne.
c1382	Ishmael
c1383	Abram was eighty-six years old
c1384	when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
c1385	When Abram was ninety-nine years old,
c1386	the LORD appeared to him
c1387	and said,
c1388	“I am God Almighty.
c1389	Walk before Me
c1390	and be blameless.
c1391	I will establish My covenant between Me and you,
c1392	and I will multiply you exceedingly.”
c1393	Then Abram fell facedown,
c1394	and God said to him,
c1396	“As for Me,
c1397	this is My covenant with you:
c1398	You will be the father of many nations.
c1399	No longer {will} you be called Abram,
c1400	but your name will be Abraham,
c1401	for I have made you the father of many nations.
c1402	I will make you exceedingly fruitful;
c1403	I will make nations [of you],
c1404	and kings will descend from you.
c1405	I will establish My covenant as an everlasting covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you,
c1406	to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
c1407	And to you and your descendants I will give the land of your sojourn— all the land of Canaan— as an eternal possession;
c1408	and I will be their God.”
c1409	God also said to Abraham,
c1410	“As for you,
c1411	you must keep My covenant, you and your descendants for the generations to come.
c1412	This is My covenant
c1413	which you are to keep:
c1414	with you and your descendants after you,
c1415	Every male among you must be circumcised.
c1416	You are to circumcise the flesh of your foreskin,
c1417	and this will be a sign of the covenant between Me and you.
c1418	Generation after generation, every male must be circumcised when he is eight days old, including those born in your household and those purchased from a foreigner—
c1419	even those who are not your offspring.
c1420	Whether they are born in your household or purchased, they must be circumcised.
c1421	My covenant in your flesh will be an everlasting covenant.
c1422	But if any male
c1423	is not circumcised,
c1424	[he] will be cut off from his people;
c1425	he has broken My covenant.”
c1426	Then God said to Abraham,
c1427	“As for Sarai your wife,
c1428	do not call her Sarai,
c1429	for her name [is to be] Sarah.
c1430	And I will bless her
c1431	and will surely give you a son by her.
c1432	I will bless her,
c1433	and she will be [the mother] of nations;
c1434	kings of peoples will descend from her.”
c1435	Abraham fell facedown.
c1436	Then he laughed
c1437	and said to himself,
c1438	“Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old?
c1439	Can Sarah
c1440	give birth at the age of ninety?”
c1441	And Abraham said to God,
c1442	“O that Ishmael might live under Your [blessing]!”
c1443	But God replied,
c1444	“Your wife Sarah {will} indeed bear you a son,
c1445	and you are to name him Isaac.
c1446	I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
c1447	As for Ishmael, I have heard you,
c1448	[and] I will surely bless him;
c1449	I will make him fruitful
c1450	and multiply him greatly.
c1451	He will become the father of twelve rulers,
c1452	and I will make him into a great nation.
c1453	But I will establish My covenant with Isaac,
c1454	whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.”
c1455	When He had finished
c1456	talking with [Abraham],
c1457	God went up from [him].
c1458	Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or purchased with his money— every male among the members of Abraham’s household—
c1459	and he circumcised them that very day,
c1460	just as God had told him.
c1461	So Abraham was ninety-nine years old
c1462	when he was circumcised,
c1463	and his son Ishmael was thirteen;
c1465	Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised on the same day.
c1466	And all the men of [Abraham’s] household— both servants born in his household and those purchased from foreigners— were circumcised with him.
c1467	Then the LORD appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre
c1468	while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent.
c1469	in the heat of the day,
c1470	And [Abraham] lifted up his eyes
c1471	and saw
c1472	three men standing nearby.
c1473	When he saw them,
c1474	he ran from
c1475	to meet them
c1476	the entrance of his tent
c1477	and bowed low to the ground.
c1478	said [Abraham],
c1479	“My lord,”
c1480	“if I have found favor in your sight, please
c1481	do not pass your servant {by}.
c1482	Let a little water be brought,
c1483	that you may wash your feet
c1484	and rest yourselves under the tree.
c1485	And I will bring a bit of bread
c1486	so that you may refresh yourselves.
c1487	you have passed ... After that,
c1488	This is why ... your servant’s way. ... you may continue on your way.”
c1489	they replied,
c1490	“Yes,” ... “you may do
c1491	as you have said.”
c1492	So Abraham hurried into the tent ... to Sarah,
c1493	and said
c1494	“Quick! Prepare
c1495	three seahs of fine flour, knead it,
c1496	and bake some bread.”
c1497	Meanwhile, Abraham ran to the herd,
c1498	selected a tender, choice calf,
c1499	and gave it to a servant,
c1500	who hurried
c1501	to prepare it.
c1502	Then Abraham brought curds and milk and the calf
c1503	that had been prepared,
c1504	and he set them before the men
c1505	and stood by them under the tree
c1506	as they ate.
c1507	they asked.
c1508	“Where is your wife Sarah?”
c1509	he replied.
c1510	“There, in the tent,”
c1511	Then the LORD said,
c1512	“I will surely return to you at this time next year,
c1513	and your wife Sarah will have a son!”
c1514	Now Sarah ... listening at the entrance to the tent.
c1515	was behind him,
c1516	And Abraham and Sarah were already old
c1517	and well along in years.
c1518	had passed
c1519	Sarah
c1520	the age of childbearing.
c1521	So [she] laughed to herself,
c1522	saying,
c1523	“After I am worn out
c1524	will I now have this pleasure?”
c1525	and my master is old,
c1526	And the LORD asked Abraham,
c1527	“Why did Sarah laugh
c1528	and say,
c1529	‘Can I really bear a child
c1530	when I am old?’
c1531	Is anything too difficult for the LORD?
c1532	At the appointed time I will return to you— in about a year—
c1533	and Sarah will have a son.”
c1534	But Sarah denied it,
c1535	saying,
c1536	“I did not laugh.”
c1537	For she was afraid.
c1538	replied [the LORD],
c1539	“No,”
c1540	“but you did laugh.”
c1541	When [the men] got up to leave [they]
c1542	looked out over Sodom,
c1543	and Abraham walked along with
c1544	them to see them off.
c1545	And the LORD said,
c1546	“Shall I hide from Abraham
c1547	what I am about to do?
c1548	Abraham {will} surely become a great and powerful nation, and through him
c1549	all the nations of the earth {will} be blessed.
c1550	For I have chosen
c1551	him, so that he will command his children and his household after
c1552	him to keep the way of the LORD
c1553	by doing what is right and just,
c1554	in order that the LORD may bring upon Abraham
c1555	what He has promised.”
c1556	Then the LORD said,
c1557	“The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah
c1558	is great. Because
c1559	their sin
c1560	is so grievous,
c1561	I will go down
c1562	to see
c1563	justify the outcry
c1564	that has reached Me.
c1565	if their actions fully
c1566	If not,
c1567	I will find out.”
c1568	And [the two] men turned away
c1569	and went toward Sodom,
c1570	but Abraham
c1571	remained standing before the LORD.
c1572	Abraham stepped forward
c1573	and said,
c1574	“Will You really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
c1575	What if there are fifty righteous ones in the city?
c1576	Will You really sweep it away
c1577	and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous
c1578	ones who are there?
c1579	Far be it from You
c1580	to do such a thing—
c1581	to kill the righteous with the wicked,
c1582	so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike.
c1583	Far be it from You!
c1584	Will not the Judge of all the earth do what is right?”
c1585	So the LORD replied,
c1586	“If I find fifty righteous ones within the city of Sodom,
c1587	on their account I will spare the whole place.”
c1588	Then Abraham answered,
c1590	“Now that I have ventured
c1591	to speak to the Lord—
c1592	though I am but dust and ashes—
c1593	suppose the fifty righteous ones lack five.
c1594	Will you destroy the whole city for the lack of five?”
c1595	He replied,
c1596	I will not destroy [it].”
c1597	“If I find forty-five there,
c1598	Once again
c1599	[Abraham] spoke to [the LORD],
c1600	He answered,
c1601	“Suppose forty are found there?”
c1603	“On account of the forty, I will not do it.”
c1604	Then [Abraham] said,
c1605	“May the Lord not be angry,
c1606	but let me speak [further].
c1607	Suppose thirty are found there?”
c1608	He answered,
c1609	I will not do it.”
c1610	“If I find thirty there,
c1611	And [Abraham] said,
c1612	“Now that I have ventured
c1613	to speak to the Lord,
c1614	suppose twenty are found there?”
c1615	He replied,
c1616	“On account of the twenty, I will not destroy [it].”
c1617	Finally, [Abraham] said,
c1618	“May the Lord not be angry,
c1619	but let me speak once more.
c1620	Suppose ten are found there?”
c1621	And He answered,
c1622	“On account of the ten, I will not destroy [it].”
c1623	the LORD ... He departed,
c1624	When ... had finished
c1625	speaking with Abraham,
c1626	and Abraham returned home.
c1627	The two angels entered Sodom in the evening,
c1628	and Lot was sitting in the gateway of [the city].
c1629	When Lot saw them,
c1630	he got up
c1631	to meet them,
c1632	bowed
c1633	with his face to the ground,
c1634	and said,
c1636	“My lords,
c1637	please turn aside into the house of your servant;
c1638	and spend the night.
c1639	wash your feet
c1640	Then you can rise early
c1641	and go on your way.”
c1642	they answered,
c1643	“No,”
c1644	“we will spend the night in the square.”
c1645	But [Lot] insisted so strongly
c1646	that they followed him
c1647	into his house.
c1648	He prepared a feast for them
c1649	and baked unleavened bread,
c1650	and they ate.
c1651	Before they had gone to bed,
c1652	all the men of the city of Sodom, both young and old, surrounded the house.
c1653	They called out to Lot,
c1654	saying,
c1655	“Where are the men
c1656	who came to you tonight?
c1657	Send them out to us
c1658	so we can have relations with them!”
c1659	Lot went outside to meet them
c1660	and shut the door behind him.
c1661	he pleaded,
c1662	“Please, ... “don’t
c1663	my brothers,”
c1664	do such a wicked thing!
c1665	Look, I have two daughters
c1666	who have never slept with a man.
c1667	Let me bring them to you,
c1668	and you can do to them whatever you want.
c1669	But do not do anything to these men,
c1670	for they have come under the protection of my roof.”
c1671	they replied.
c1672	“Get out of the way!”
c1673	And they declared,
c1674	“This one came
c1675	here as a foreigner,
c1676	and he is already acting like a judge!
c1677	Now we will treat you worse than them.”
c1678	And they pressed in on Lot
c1679	and moved in
c1680	to break down the door.
c1681	But the men [inside] reached out,
c1682	pulled Lot into the house with them,
c1683	and shut the door.
c1684	And ... the men
c1685	at the entrance,
c1686	they struck with blindness ... both young and old,
c1687	so that they were unable
c1688	to find the door.
c1689	Then the [two] men said to Lot,
c1690	“Do you have anyone else here—
c1691	a son-in-law, your sons or daughters, or anyone
c1692	else in the city who belongs to you?
c1693	Get them out of here,
c1694	because we are about to destroy this place.
c1695	For the outcry to the LORD [against its people] is so great
c1696	that [He] has sent
c1697	us to destroy it.”
c1698	So Lot went out
c1699	and spoke to the sons-in-law who were pledged in marriage to his daughters.
c1700	he said.
c1701	“Get up,”
c1702	“Get out of this place,
c1703	for the LORD is about to destroy the city!”
c1704	But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
c1705	At daybreak
c1706	the angels hurried Lot along,
c1707	saying,
c1708	“Get up!
c1709	Take your wife and your two daughters
c1710	who are here,
c1711	or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.”
c1712	But when [Lot] hesitated,
c1713	the men grabbed his hand and the hands of his wife and his two daughters. ... because of the LORD’s compassion for them.
c1714	And they led them
c1715	safely out of the city,
c1717	As soon as the men had brought them out,
c1718	one of them said,
c1719	“Run for your lives!
c1720	Do not look back,
c1721	and do not stop anywhere on the plain!
c1722	Flee to the mountains,
c1723	or you will be swept away!”
c1724	But Lot replied,
c1725	“No, ... please!
c1726	my lords,
c1727	Your servant has indeed found favor in your sight,
c1728	me great kindness
c1729	and you have shown
c1730	by sparing my life.
c1731	But I cannot
c1732	run to the mountains;
c1733	the disaster will overtake me,
c1734	and I will die.
c1735	Look, this town [is] near ... Please
c1736	enough for me flee to it, ... there—
c1737	and it is a small place.
c1738	let me flee
c1739	is it not a small place?
c1740	Then my life will be saved.”
c1741	he answered,
c1742	“Very well,” ... “I will grant this request as well,
c1743	and will not demolish the town
c1744	you indicate.
c1745	Hurry!
c1746	Run there quickly,
c1747	for I cannot
c1748	do anything
c1749	until you reach it.”
c1750	That is why the town was called Zoar.
c1751	When the sun had risen over the land,
c1752	Lot had reached Zoar.
c1753	Then the LORD rained down brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah— from the LORD out of the heavens.
c1754	Thus He destroyed these cities and the entire plain, including all the inhabitants of the cities and everything that grew on the ground.
c1755	But [Lot’s] wife looked back,
c1756	and she became a pillar of salt.
c1757	Early the next morning, Abraham got up and returned to the place
c1758	where he had stood before the LORD.
c1759	He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain,
c1760	and he saw
c1761	the smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace.
c1762	So
c1763	when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
c1764	He remembered Abraham,
c1765	and He brought Lot out of the catastrophe
c1766	that destroyed the cities
c1767	where [he] had lived.
c1768	Lot ... left Zoar
c1769	and settled in the mountains—
c1770	and his two daughters
c1771	for he was afraid
c1772	to stay in Zoar—
c1773	where [they] lived in a cave.
c1774	One day the older [daughter] said to the younger,
c1775	“Our father is old,
c1776	and there is no man in the land
c1777	to sleep with us, as is the custom over all the earth.
c1778	Come,
c1779	let us get our father drunk with wine,
c1780	so that we can sleep with
c1781	him and preserve [his] line.”
c1782	So that night they got their father drunk with wine,
c1783	and the firstborn came
c1784	and slept with her father;
c1785	he was not aware
c1786	when she lay down
c1787	or when she got up.
c1788	The next day
c1789	the older [daughter] said to the younger,
c1790	“Look, I slept with my father last night.
c1791	Let us get him drunk with wine again tonight,
c1792	so you can go
c1793	sleep with him,
c1794	and we can preserve our father’s line.”
c1795	So again that night they got their father drunk with wine,
c1796	and the younger [daughter] went
c1797	and slept with him;
c1798	he was not aware
c1799	when she lay down
c1800	or when she got up.
c1801	Thus both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.
c1802	The older [daughter] gave birth to a son
c1803	and named him Moab.
c1804	He is the father of the Moabites of today.
c1805	The younger [daughter] also gave birth to a son, ... He
c1806	and she named him Ben-ammi.
c1807	is the father of the Ammonites of today.
c1808	Now Abraham journeyed from there to the region of the Negev
c1809	and settled between Kadesh and Shur.
c1810	While he was staying in Gerar,
c1811	Abraham said of his wife Sarah,
c1812	“She is my sister.”
c1813	So Abimelech king of Gerar ... brought
c1814	had Sarah ... to him.
c1815	One night, however, God came to Abimelech in a dream
c1816	and told him,
c1817	“You are as good as dead because of the woman
c1818	you have taken,
c1819	for she is a married woman.”
c1820	Now Abimelech had not gone near her,
c1821	so he replied,
c1822	“Lord,
c1823	would You destroy a nation even though it is innocent?
c1824	Didn’t [Abraham] tell me,
c1825	‘She is my sister’?
c1826	And she herself said,
c1827	‘He is my brother.’
c1828	I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.”
c1829	Then God said to [Abimelech] in the dream,
c1830	“Yes, I know
c1831	that you did this with a clear conscience,
c1832	and so I have also kept you
c1833	from sinning against Me.
c1834	That is why I did not let
c1835	you touch her.
c1836	Now
c1837	return the man’s wife,
c1838	for he is a prophet;
c1839	he will pray for you
c1840	and you will live.
c1841	But if you do not restore her,
c1842	be aware
c1843	that you will surely die— you and all
c1844	who belong to you.”
c1845	Early the next morning Abimelech got up
c1846	and summoned all his servants;
c1847	and when he described to them all that had happened,
c1848	the men were terrified.
c1849	Then Abimelech called Abraham
c1850	and asked,
c1851	“What have you done to us?
c1852	How have I sinned against you,
c1853	that you have brought such tremendous guilt upon me and my kingdom?
c1854	things
c1855	You have done ... that should not
c1856	to me ... be done.”
c1857	Abimelech also asked Abraham,
c1858	“What prompted
c1859	you to do such a thing?”
c1860	Abraham replied,
c1861	“I thought to myself,
c1862	‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place.
c1863	They will kill me on account of my wife.’
c1864	Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father—
c1865	though not the daughter of my mother—
c1866	and she became my wife.
c1868	So when God had me journey from my father’s house,
c1869	I said to [Sarah],
c1870	‘This is how ... your loyalty
c1871	you can show ... to me:
c1872	Wherever
c1873	we go,
c1874	say of me,
c1875	“He is my brother.”’”
c1876	So Abimelech brought sheep and cattle, menservants and maidservants,
c1877	and he gave them to Abraham
c1878	and restored his wife Sarah to him.
c1879	And Abimelech said,
c1880	“Look, my land is before you.
c1881	Settle wherever you please.”
c1882	And he said to Sarah,
c1883	“See, I am giving your brother a thousand [pieces] of silver.
c1884	It [is] your vindication before all
c1885	who are with you;
c1886	you are completely
c1887	cleared.”
c1888	Then Abraham prayed to God,
c1889	and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants,
c1890	so that they could again bear children—
c1891	for on account of Abraham’s wife Sarah, the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech’s household.
c1892	Now the LORD attended to Sarah
c1893	as He had said,
c1894	and the LORD did for Sarah
c1895	what He had promised.
c1896	conceived
c1897	So Sarah ... and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time
c1898	God had promised him.
c1899	And Abraham gave the name ... to the son
c1901	Sarah bore to him.
c1902	Isaac
c1903	When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him,
c1904	as God had commanded him.
c1905	Abraham was a hundred years old
c1906	when his son Isaac was born to him.
c1907	Then Sarah said,
c1908	“God has made me laugh,
c1909	and everyone
c1910	who hears of this
c1911	will laugh with me.”
c1912	She added,
c1913	“Who would have told Abraham
c1914	that Sarah would nurse children?
c1915	Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
c1916	So the child grew
c1917	and was weaned,
c1918	and Abraham held a great feast on the day
c1919	Isaac was weaned.
c1920	But Sarah saw that the son ... Hagar the Egyptian
c1921	whom ... had borne to Abraham
c1922	was mocking [her son],
c1923	and she said to Abraham,
c1924	“Expel the slave woman and her son,
c1925	for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac!”
c1926	Now this matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son [Ishmael].
c1927	But God said to Abraham,
c1928	“Do not be distressed about the boy and your maidservant.
c1929	everything
c1930	that Sarah tells you,
c1931	Listen to
c1932	for through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.
c1933	But I will also ... of the slave woman’s son,
c1934	make a nation
c1935	because he is your offspring.”
c1936	Early in the morning, Abraham got up,
c1937	took bread and a skin of water,
c1938	Hagar’s
c1939	put them on ... shoulders,
c1940	and sent her away with the boy.
c1942	She left
c1943	and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
c1944	When the water in the skin was gone,
c1945	she left the boy under one of the bushes.
c1946	Then she went off
c1947	and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away,
c1948	for she said,
c1949	“I cannot bear to watch the boy die!”
c1950	And as she sat nearby,
c1951	she lifted up her voice
c1952	and wept.
c1953	Then God heard the voice of the boy,
c1954	and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven,
c1956	“What is wrong,
c1957	Hagar?
c1958	Do not be afraid,
c1959	for God has heard the voice of the boy
c1960	where he lies.
c1961	Arise,
c1962	lift up the boy
c1963	and take him by the hand,
c1964	for I will make him into a great nation.”
c1965	Then God opened her eyes,
c1966	and she saw a well of water.
c1967	So she went
c1968	and filled the skin with water
c1969	and gave the boy a drink.
c1970	And God was with the boy,
c1971	and he grew up
c1972	and settled in the wilderness
c1973	and became a great archer.
c1974	And while he was dwelling in the wilderness of Paran,
c1975	his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
c1976	At that time
c1977	Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham,
c1979	“God is with you in all
c1980	that you do.
c1981	Now, therefore,
c1982	swear to me here before God
c1983	that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or descendants.
c1984	the same kindness
c1985	that I have shown to you.”
c1986	Show to me and to the country
c1987	in which you reside
c1988	And Abraham replied,
c1989	“I swear it.”
c1990	But when Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well
c1991	that Abimelech’s servants had seized,
c1992	Abimelech replied,
c1993	“I do not know
c1994	who has done this.
c1995	You did not tell me,
c1996	so I have not heard about it until today.”
c1997	So Abraham brought sheep and cattle
c1998	and gave them to Abimelech,
c1999	and the two men made a covenant.
c2000	Abraham separated seven ewe lambs from the flock,
c2001	and Abimelech asked [him],
c2002	“Why ... these seven ewe lambs?”
c2003	have you set apart
c2004	He replied,
c2005	“You are to accept the seven ewe lambs from my hand ... that
c2006	as my witness
c2007	I dug this well.”
c2008	So that place was called Beersheba,
c2009	because it was there that the two of them swore an oath.
c2010	After they had made the covenant at Beersheba,
c2011	Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army got up
c2012	and returned to the land of the Philistines.
c2013	And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba,
c2014	and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God.
c2015	And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
c2016	Some time later
c2017	God tested Abraham
c2018	and said to him,
c2019	“Abraham!”
c2020	he answered.
c2021	“Here I am,”
c2022	[God] said,
c2023	“Take your son,” ... “your only
c2024	whom you love,
c2025	son Isaac,
c2026	and go to the land of Moriah.
c2027	Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains
c2028	I will show you.”
c2029	So Abraham got up early the next morning,
c2030	saddled his donkey,
c2031	and took along two of his servants and his son Isaac.
c2032	He split wood for a burnt offering
c2033	and set out for
c2034	the place
c2035	God had designated
c2036	On the third day
c2037	Abraham looked up
c2038	and saw the place in the distance.
c2039	Abraham told his servants.
c2040	“Stay here with the donkey,”
c2041	“The boy and I will go over there
c2042	to worship,
c2043	and then we will return to you.”
c2044	Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering
c2045	and placed it on his son Isaac.
c2046	He himself carried the fire and the sacrificial knife,
c2047	and the two of them walked on together.
c2048	Then Isaac said to his father Abraham,
c2050	“My father!”
c2051	he replied.
c2052	“Here I am,
c2053	my son,”
c2054	said Isaac,
c2055	“The fire and the wood are here,”
c2056	“but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
c2057	Abraham answered,
c2058	“God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering,
c2059	my son.”
c2060	And the two walked on together.
c2061	When they arrived at the place
c2062	God had designated,
c2063	Abraham built the altar there
c2064	and arranged the wood.
c2065	He bound his son Isaac
c2066	and placed him on the altar, atop the wood.
c2067	Then Abraham reached out his hand
c2068	and took the knife
c2069	to slaughter his son.
c2070	Just then, the Angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven,
c2072	“Abraham, Abraham!”
c2073	he replied.
c2074	“Here I am,”
c2075	said [the Angel],
c2076	“Do not lay a hand on the boy
c2077	or do anything to him,”
c2078	“for now I know
c2079	that you fear God,
c2080	since you have not withheld your only son from Me.”
c2081	Then Abraham lifted up his eyes
c2082	and saw
c2083	behind [him] a ram
c2084	in the thicket, caught by its horns.
c2085	So [he] went
c2086	and took the ram
c2087	and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son.
c2088	And Abraham called that place
c2089	The LORD Will Provide.
c2090	So to this day it is said,
c2091	“On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.”
c2092	And the Angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time,
c2093	saying,
c2094	“By Myself I have sworn,
c2095	declares the LORD,
c2096	that
c2097	because you have done this
c2098	and have not withheld your only son,
c2099	I will surely bless you,
c2100	and I will multiply your descendants like the stars in the sky and the sand
c2101	on the seashore.
c2102	Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies.
c2103	And through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed,
c2104	because you have obeyed My voice.”
c2105	Abraham went back to his servants,
c2106	and they got up
c2107	and set out together for Beersheba.
c2108	And Abraham settled in Beersheba.
c2109	Some time later
c2110	Abraham was told,
c2112	“Milcah has also borne sons to your brother Nahor:
c2113	Uz the firstborn, his brother Buz, Kemuel the father of Aram,
c2114	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”
c2115	And Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.
c2116	Milcah bore these eight [sons] to Abraham’s brother Nahor.
c2117	his concubine,
c2118	whose name was Reumah,
c2119	Moreover, ... bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
c2120	Now Sarah lived to be 127 years old.
c2122	[She] died in Kiriath-arba
c2123	(that is, Hebron)
c2124	in the land of Canaan,
c2125	and Abraham went out
c2126	to mourn ... for [her].
c2127	and to weep
c2128	Then Abraham got up from beside his dead wife
c2129	and said to the Hittites,
c2131	“I am a stranger and an outsider among you.
c2132	Give me a burial site among you
c2133	so that I can bury my dead.”
c2134	The Hittites replied to Abraham,
c2136	“Listen to us,
c2137	sir.
c2138	You are God’s chosen one among us.
c2139	Bury your dead in the finest of our tombs.
c2140	of us
c2141	None ... will withhold his tomb
c2142	for burying your dead.”
c2143	Then Abraham rose
c2144	and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites.
c2145	he said to them,
c2147	“If you are willing
c2148	for me to bury my dead,”
c2149	“listen to me,
c2150	and approach Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf
c2151	to sell me the cave of Machpelah
c2152	that belongs to him;
c2153	it is at the end of his field.
c2154	Let him sell it to me in your presence for full price, so that [I may have] a burial site.”
c2155	Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth.
c2156	So in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham,
c2158	“No,
c2159	my lord.
c2160	Listen to me.
c2161	I give you the field,
c2162	you the cave
c2163	that is in it.
c2164	and I give
c2165	I give it to you in the presence of my people.
c2166	Bury your dead.”
c2167	Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land
c2168	and said to Ephron in their presence,
c2170	“If you
c2171	will please listen to me,
c2172	I will pay you the price of the field.
c2173	Accept it from me,
c2174	so that I may bury my dead there.”
c2175	Ephron answered Abraham,
c2177	my lord.
c2178	“Listen to me,
c2179	The land [is worth] four hundred shekels of silver,
c2180	but what is that between you and me?
c2181	Bury your dead.”
c2182	Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms
c2183	and weighed out [for him] the price
c2184	he had named in the hearing of the Hittites:
c2185	four hundred shekels of silver,
c2186	according to the standard of the merchants.
c2187	So Ephron’s field ... were deeded over
c2188	at Machpelah
c2189	near Mamre,
c2190	the cave
c2191	that was in it,
c2192	and all the trees
c2193	of the field,
c2194	within the boundaries
c2195	to Abraham’s possession in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.
c2196	After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field at Machpelah near Mamre
c2197	(that is, Hebron)
c2198	in the land of Canaan.
c2199	So the field ... cave were deeded
c2200	and its
c2201	by the Hittites to Abraham as a burial site.
c2202	By now Abraham was old
c2203	and well along in years,
c2204	and the LORD had blessed him in every way.
c2205	So Abraham instructed the chief servant of his household,
c2206	who managed all he owned,
c2208	“Place your hand under my thigh,
c2209	and I will have you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth,
c2210	that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites
c2211	among whom I am dwelling,
c2212	but will go to my country and my kindred
c2213	to take a wife for my son Isaac.”
c2214	The servant asked him,
c2215	“What if the woman is unwilling
c2216	to follow me to this land?
c2217	Shall I then take your son back to the land
c2218	from which you came?”
c2219	Abraham replied,
c2220	“Make sure
c2221	that you do not take my son back there.
c2222	The LORD, the God of heaven,
c2223	who brought me from my father’s house and my native land,
c2224	who spoke to me
c2225	and promised me on oath,
c2226	saying,
c2227	‘To your offspring I will give this land’—
c2228	He will send His angel before you
c2229	so that you can take a wife for my son from there.
c2230	And if the woman is unwilling
c2231	to follow you,
c2232	then you are released from this oath of mine.
c2233	Only do not take my son back there.”
c2234	So the servant placed his hand under his master Abraham’s thigh
c2235	and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
c2236	Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels
c2237	and departed
c2238	with all manner of good things from his master in hand.
c2239	And he set out
c2240	for Nahor’s hometown in Mesopotamia.
c2241	As evening approached, he made the camels kneel down near the well outside the town, at the time
c2242	when the women went out to draw water.
c2243	he prayed,
c2244	“O LORD, God of my master Abraham,”
c2245	“please grant me success today,
c2246	and show kindness to my master Abraham.
c2247	Here I am, standing beside the spring,
c2248	and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out
c2249	to draw water.
c2250	Now may it happen
c2251	that the girl
c2252	to whom I say,
c2253	‘Please let down your jar
c2254	that I may drink,’
c2255	and who responds,
c2256	‘Drink,
c2257	and I will water your camels as well’—
c2258	let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac.
c2259	By this I will know
c2260	that You have shown kindness to my master.”
c2262	Before he had finished
c2263	praying,
c2264	Rebekah came out
c2265	She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor.
c2266	with her jar on her shoulder.
c2267	Now the girl was very beautiful,
c2268	a virgin
c2269	who had not had relations with any man.
c2270	She went down to the spring,
c2271	filled her jar,
c2272	and came up again.
c2273	So the servant ran
c2274	to meet her
c2275	and said,
c2276	“Please let me have a little water from your jar.”
c2277	she replied,
c2278	“Drink,
c2279	my lord,”
c2280	and she quickly
c2281	lowered her jar to her hands
c2282	and gave him a drink.
c2283	After she
c2284	had given him a drink,
c2285	she said,
c2286	“I will also draw water for your camels,
c2287	until they have had enough
c2288	to drink.”
c2289	And she quickly
c2290	emptied her jar into the trough
c2291	and ran back to the well
c2292	to draw water,
c2293	until she had drawn water for all his camels.
c2294	Meanwhile, the man watched her silently
c2295	to see
c2296	the LORD had made his journey a success.
c2297	whether or not
c2298	And
c2299	after the camels had finished
c2300	drinking,
c2301	[he] took out a gold ring
c2302	weighing a beka,
c2303	and two ... bracelets for her wrists
c2304	gold ... weighing ten [shekels].
c2305	he asked.
c2306	“Whose daughter are you?”
c2307	“Please tell me,
c2308	is there room in your father’s house
c2309	for us to spend the night?”
c2310	She replied,
c2311	“I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah
c2312	bore to Nahor.”
c2313	Then she added,
c2314	“We have plenty of straw and feed, as well as
c2315	a place [for you]
c2316	to spend the night.”
c2317	Then the man bowed down
c2318	and worshiped the LORD,
c2319	saying,
c2320	“Blessed [be] the LORD, the God of my master Abraham,
c2321	who has not withheld His kindness and faithfulness from my master.
c2322	As for me,
c2323	the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s kinsmen.”
c2324	The girl ran
c2325	and told her mother’s household about these things.
c2326	Now Rebekah had a brother
c2327	named Laban,
c2328	and [he] rushed out to the man at the spring.
c2330	As soon as he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists,
c2331	and heard Rebekah’s words,
c2333	“The man said this to me,”
c2334	he went and found the man
c2335	standing by the camels near the spring.
c2336	said Laban.
c2337	“Come,
c2338	you who are blessed by the LORD,”
c2339	“Why are you standing out here?
c2340	I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”
c2341	So the man came to the house,
c2342	and the camels were unloaded.
c2343	Straw and feed were brought to the camels,
c2344	and water
c2345	to wash his feet and the feet of his companions.
c2347	Then a meal was set before [the man],
c2348	eat
c2349	but he said,
c2350	“I will not
c2351	until I have told you what I came to say.”
c2352	So Laban said,
c2353	“Please speak.”
c2354	he replied.
c2355	“I am Abraham’s servant,”
c2356	“The LORD has greatly blessed my master,
c2357	and he has become rich.
c2358	He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, camels and donkeys.
c2359	My master’s wife Sarah has borne [him] a son in her old age,
c2360	and [my master] has given him everything he owns.
c2362	My master made me swear an oath
c2363	and said,
c2364	‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites
c2365	in whose land I dwell,
c2366	but you shall go to my father’s house and to my kindred
c2367	to take a wife for my son.’
c2368	Then I asked my master,
c2369	‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’
c2370	And he told me,
c2371	‘The LORD,
c2372	before whom I have walked,
c2373	will send His angel with you
c2374	and make your journey a success,
c2375	so that you may take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father’s house.
c2376	Then,
c2377	when you go to my kindred,
c2378	if they refuse to give her to you,
c2379	you will be released from my oath.’
c2380	So when I came to the spring today,
c2381	I prayed,
c2382	‘O LORD, God of my master Abraham,
c2383	if only You would make my journey a success!
c2385	Here I am, standing beside this spring.
c2386	Now [if]
c2387	a maiden
c2388	comes out
c2389	to draw water
c2390	and I say to her,
c2391	“Please let me drink a little water from your jar,”
c2392	and she replies,
c2393	“Drink, ... as well,”
c2394	and I will draw water for your camels
c2395	may she be the woman
c2396	the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.
c2397	And before I had finished
c2398	praying in my heart,
c2399	there was Rebekah coming out
c2400	with her jar on her shoulder,
c2401	and she went down to the spring
c2402	and drew water.
c2403	So I said to her,
c2404	‘Please give me a drink.’
c2405	She quickly
c2406	lowered her jar from her [shoulder]
c2407	and said,
c2408	‘Drink,
c2409	and I will water your camels as well.’
c2410	So I drank,
c2411	and she also watered the camels.
c2412	Then I asked her,
c2413	She replied,
c2414	‘Whose daughter are you?’
c2416	‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor,
c2417	whom Milcah bore to him.’
c2418	So I put the ring on her nose
c2419	and the bracelets on her wrists.
c2420	Then I bowed down
c2421	and worshiped the LORD;
c2422	and I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham,
c2423	who led me on the right road
c2424	to take the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son.
c2425	Now
c2426	if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master,
c2427	tell me;
c2428	but if not,
c2429	let me know,
c2430	so that I may go elsewhere.”
c2431	Laban and Bethuel answered,
c2433	“This is from the LORD; ... choice in the matter.
c2434	we have no
c2436	Rebekah is here before you.
c2437	Take
c2438	her and go,
c2439	and let her become the wife of your master’s son,
c2440	just as the LORD has decreed.”
c2442	When Abraham’s servant heard their words,
c2443	he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.
c2444	Then he brought out jewels of silver and gold, and articles of clothing,
c2445	and gave them to Rebekah.
c2446	He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother.
c2447	him ate
c2448	Then he and the men ... and drank
c2449	with
c2450	and spent the night there.
c2451	When they got up the next morning,
c2452	he said,
c2453	“Send me on my way to my master.”
c2454	But her brother and mother said,
c2455	“Let the girl remain with us ten days or so.
c2456	After that, she may go.”
c2457	But he replied,
c2458	“Do not delay me,
c2459	since the LORD has made my journey a success.
c2460	Send me on my way
c2461	so that I may go to my master.”
c2462	So they said,
c2463	“We will call the girl
c2464	and ask her opinion.”
c2465	They called Rebekah
c2466	and asked her,
c2467	“Will you go with this man?”
c2468	she replied.
c2469	“I will go,”
c2470	So they sent their sister Rebekah {on her way}, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men.
c2471	And they blessed Rebekah
c2472	and said to her,
c2473	“Our sister,
c2474	may you become the mother of thousands upon thousands.
c2475	May your offspring possess the gates of their enemies.”
c2476	Then Rebekah and her servant girls got ready,
c2477	mounted the camels,
c2478	and followed the man.
c2479	So the servant took Rebekah
c2480	and left.
c2481	Now Isaac had just returned
c2482	from Beer-lahai-roi,
c2483	for he was living in the Negev.
c2484	Isaac went out
c2485	to the field to meditate,
c2486	Early in the evening
c2487	and looking up,
c2488	he saw
c2489	the camels approaching.
c2490	Rebekah lifted up her eyes,
c2491	and when she saw Isaac,
c2492	she got down from her camel
c2493	and asked the servant,
c2494	“Who is that man
c2495	in the field coming
c2496	to meet us?”
c2497	the servant answered.
c2498	“It is my master,”
c2499	So she took her veil
c2500	and covered herself.
c2501	Then the servant told Isaac all
c2502	that he had done.
c2503	And Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah
c2504	and took Rebekah
c2505	as his wife.
c2506	loved her
c2507	And Isaac ... and was comforted after his mother’s death.
c2508	Now Abraham ... another
c2509	had taken ... wife,
c2510	named Keturah,
c2511	and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
c2512	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan.
c2513	And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites.
c2514	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah.
c2515	All these were descendants of Keturah.
c2516	Abraham left everything
c2518	he owned to Isaac.
c2519	to the sons ... concubines
c2520	Abraham ... of his
c2521	gave gifts
c2522	and sent them away from his son Isaac
c2523	But while he was still alive,
c2524	to the land of the east.
c2525	Abraham lived a total of
c2527	175 years.
c2528	he breathed his last
c2529	And at a ripe old age ... and died, old and contented,
c2530	and was gathered to his people.
c2531	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah ... in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite.
c2532	near Mamre,
c2533	This was the field
c2534	that Abraham had bought from the Hittites.
c2535	Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah.
c2536	After Abraham’s death,
c2537	God blessed his son Isaac,
c2538	who lived near Beer-lahai-roi.
c2539	This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael,
c2540	whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham.
c2541	These are the names of the sons of Ishmael in the order of their birth:
c2542	Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
c2543	Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
c2544	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
c2545	These
c2546	were the sons of Ishmael,
c2547	and these were their names by their villages and encampments—
c2548	twelve princes of their tribes.
c2549	Ishmael lived a total of
c2550	137 years.
c2551	Then he breathed his last
c2552	and died,
c2553	and was gathered to his people.
c2554	[Ishmael’s descendants] settled from Havilah to Shur,
c2555	which is near the border of Egypt
c2556	as you go toward Asshur.
c2557	And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.
c2558	This is the account of Abraham's son Isaac.
c2559	Abraham became the father of Isaac,
c2560	and Isaac was forty years old
c2561	when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban the Aramean.
c2562	Later, Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife,
c2563	because she [was] barren.
c2564	And the LORD heard his prayer,
c2565	and his wife Rebekah conceived.
c2566	But the children inside her struggled with each other,
c2567	and she said,
c2569	“Why is this happening to me?”
c2570	So [Rebekah] went
c2571	to inquire of the LORD,
c2572	and [He] declared to her:
c2573	“Two nations are in your womb,
c2574	and two peoples from within you will be separated;
c2575	one people will be stronger than the other,
c2576	and the older will serve the younger.”
c2577	When her time came
c2578	to give birth,
c2579	there were indeed twins in her womb.
c2580	The first one came out red,
c2581	covered with hair like a fur coat;
c2582	so they named him Esau.
c2583	After this, his brother came out
c2584	grasping Esau’s heel;
c2585	so he was named Jacob.
c2586	And Isaac was sixty years old
c2587	when [the twins] were born.
c2588	When the boys grew up,
c2589	Esau became ... a man
c2590	a skillful hunter,
c2591	of the field, ... man
c2592	but Jacob was a quiet
c2593	who stayed at home.
c2594	Isaac ... he loved Esau;
c2595	Because ... had a taste for wild game,
c2596	but Rebekah loved Jacob.
c2597	One day, while Jacob was cooking some stew,
c2598	Esau came in from the field
c2599	and was famished.
c2600	He said to Jacob,
c2601	“Let me eat some of that red [stew],
c2602	for I am famished.”
c2603	(That is why he was also called Edom.)
c2604	Jacob replied.
c2605	“First sell me your birthright,”
c2606	said Esau,
c2607	“Look,” ... “I am about to die,
c2609	so what good is a birthright to me?”
c2610	Jacob said.
c2611	“Swear to me first,”
c2612	So [Esau] swore
c2613	to Jacob and sold him the birthright.
c2614	Then Jacob gave some bread and lentil stew to Esau;
c2615	he ate
c2616	and drank,
c2617	and then got up
c2618	and went away.
c2619	Thus Esau despised his birthright.
c2620	Now there was another famine in the land, subsequent to the [one]
c2621	that had occurred in Abraham’s time.
c2622	And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar.
c2623	The LORD appeared to
c2624	[Isaac] and said,
c2625	“Do not go down to Egypt.
c2626	Settle in the land
c2627	where I tell you.
c2628	Stay in this land as a foreigner,
c2629	and I will be with
c2630	you and bless you.
c2631	For I will give all these lands to you and your offspring,
c2632	and I will confirm the oath
c2633	that I swore to your father Abraham.
c2634	I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky,
c2635	and I will give [them] all these lands,
c2636	and through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed,
c2637	because Abraham listened to My voice
c2638	and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.”
c2639	So Isaac settled in Gerar.
c2640	But when the men of that place asked about his wife,
c2641	he said,
c2642	“She is my sister.”
c2643	For he was afraid
c2644	to say,
c2645	“[She is] my wife,”
c2646	since he thought to himself, “The men of this place will kill me on account of Rebekah,
c2647	because she is so beautiful.”
c2649	When Isaac had been there a long time,
c2650	Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from the window
c2651	and was surprised to see
c2652	Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
c2653	Abimelech sent for Isaac
c2654	and said,
c2655	“So she is really your wife!
c2656	How could you say,
c2657	‘She is my sister’?”
c2658	Isaac replied,
c2659	“Because I thought
c2660	I might die on account of her.”
c2661	Abimelech said,
c2662	“What is this you have done to us?”
c2663	“One of the people could easily have slept with your wife,
c2664	and you would have brought guilt upon us.”
c2665	So Abimelech warned all the people,
c2666	saying,
c2667	“Whoever harms this man or his wife
c2668	will surely be put to death.”
c2669	Now Isaac sowed seed in the land,
c2670	and in that very year he reaped a hundredfold.
c2671	And the LORD blessed him,
c2672	and [he] became richer and richer,
c2673	wealthy.
c2674	until he was exceedingly
c2675	He owned so many flocks and herds and servants
c2676	that the Philistines envied him.
c2677	all the wells
c2678	that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham.
c2679	So the Philistines ... and stopped up
c2680	took dirt
c2681	Then Abimelech said to Isaac,
c2682	“Depart from us,
c2683	for you are much too powerful for us.”
c2684	So Isaac left that place
c2685	and encamped in the Valley of Gerar
c2686	and settled there.
c2687	Isaac reopened
c2688	the wells
c2689	that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham,
c2690	which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died.
c2691	And he gave [these wells] the same names
c2692	his father had given them.
c2693	Then Isaac’s servants dug in the valley
c2694	and found a well of fresh water there.
c2695	But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen
c2696	and said,
c2697	“The water is ours!”
c2698	So he named the well Esek,
c2699	because they contended with him.
c2700	And they dug another well
c2701	and quarreled over that one also;
c2702	so he named it Sitnah.
c2703	He moved on from there
c2704	and dug another [well],
c2705	and they did not quarrel over it.
c2706	He named it Rehoboth
c2707	and said,
c2708	“At last the LORD has made room for us,
c2709	and we will be fruitful in the land.”
c2710	From there [Isaac] went up to Beersheba,
c2711	and that night the LORD appeared to him
c2712	and said,
c2713	“I am the God of your father Abraham.
c2714	Do not be afraid,
c2715	for I am with you.
c2716	I will bless
c2717	you and multiply your descendants for the sake of My servant Abraham.”
c2718	So he built an altar there
c2719	and called on the name of the LORD,
c2720	and he pitched his tent there.
c2721	Isaac’s servants also dug a well there.
c2722	Later, Abimelech came to [Isaac] from Gerar,
c2723	with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.
c2724	Isaac asked them.
c2725	“Why have you come to me?”
c2726	“You hated me
c2727	and sent me away.”
c2728	they replied.
c2729	“We can plainly see
c2730	that the LORD has been with you,”
c2731	“We think
c2732	there should be an oath between two parties— between us and you.
c2733	Let us make a covenant with you
c2734	that you will not harm us, ... to you,
c2735	just as we have not harmed you,
c2736	and we have done nothing but good
c2737	sending you on your way in peace.
c2738	And now you are blessed by the LORD.”
c2739	So [Isaac] prepared a feast for them,
c2740	and they ate
c2741	and drank.
c2742	And they got up early the next morning
c2743	and swore an oath
c2744	to each other.
c2745	Then Isaac sent them on their way,
c2746	and they left him in peace.
c2747	On that same day
c2748	Isaac’s servants came
c2749	to tell him about the well
c2750	they had dug,
c2751	telling him,
c2752	“We have found water!”
c2753	He called it Shibah,
c2754	and to this day the name of the city is Beersheba.
c2755	When Esau was forty years old,
c2756	he took as his wives Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.
c2757	And they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
c2758	was
c2759	When Isaac ... old
c2760	and his eyes were so weak
c2761	he could no longer see,
c2762	he called his older son Esau
c2763	and said to him,
c2764	“My son.”
c2765	[Esau] replied.
c2766	“Here I am,”
c2767	said [Isaac],
c2768	“Look,” ... “I am now old
c2769	and do not know the day of my death.
c2771	Take your weapons— your quiver and bow—
c2772	and go out in the field
c2773	to hunt some game for me.
c2774	Then prepare a tasty dish
c2775	that I love
c2776	and bring it to me
c2777	to eat,
c2778	so that I may bless
c2779	you before I die.”
c2780	Now Rebekah was listening
c2781	to what Isaac told his son Esau.
c2782	So when Esau went into the field
c2783	to hunt game
c2784	[and] bring [it back],
c2785	Rebekah said to her son Jacob,
c2787	“Behold, I overheard your father
c2788	saying to your brother Esau,
c2790	‘Bring me some game
c2791	and prepare me a tasty dish
c2792	to eat,
c2793	so that I may bless you in the presence of the LORD before I die.’
c2794	Now,
c2795	my son,
c2796	listen to my voice
c2797	and do exactly as I tell you.
c2798	Go out to the flock
c2799	and bring me two choice young goats,
c2800	so that I can make them into a tasty dish for your father—
c2801	the kind he loves.
c2802	Then take it to your father
c2803	to eat,
c2804	so that he may bless you before he dies.”
c2805	Jacob answered his mother Rebekah,
c2806	“Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man,
c2807	but I am smooth-skinned.
c2808	What if my father touches me?
c2809	Then I would be revealed to him as a deceiver,
c2810	and I would bring upon myself a curse
c2811	rather than a blessing.”
c2812	His mother replied,
c2813	“Your curse be on me,
c2814	my son.
c2815	Just obey my voice
c2816	and go
c2817	get them for me.”
c2818	So [Jacob] went
c2819	and got [two goats]
c2820	and brought them to his mother,
c2821	who made the tasty food
c2822	his father loved.
c2823	And Rebekah took the finest clothes ... to her older son Esau,
c2824	in the house that belonged
c2825	and she put them on her younger son Jacob.
c2826	She also put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
c2827	Then she handed ... the tasty food and bread
c2828	she had made.
c2829	her son Jacob
c2830	So [Jacob] went to his father
c2831	and said,
c2832	“My father.”
c2833	he answered.
c2834	“Here I am!”
c2835	“Which one are you,
c2836	my son?”
c2837	Jacob said to his father,
c2838	“I am Esau, your firstborn.
c2839	I have done
c2840	as you told me.
c2841	Please
c2842	sit up
c2843	and eat some of my game,
c2844	so that you may bless me.”
c2845	But Isaac asked his son,
c2846	“How ... it so quickly,
c2847	did you ever find
c2848	my son?”
c2849	he replied.
c2850	“Because the LORD your God brought [it] to me,”
c2851	Then Isaac said to Jacob,
c2852	“Please come closer
c2853	so I can touch you,
c2854	my son.
c2855	Are you really my son Esau
c2856	or not?”
c2857	So Jacob came close to his father Isaac,
c2858	who touched him
c2859	and said,
c2860	“The voice is the voice of Jacob,
c2861	but the hands are the hands of Esau.”
c2862	[Isaac] did not recognize him,
c2863	because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau;
c2864	so he blessed him.
c2865	Again he asked,
c2866	“Are you really my son Esau?”
c2867	And he replied,
c2868	“I am.”
c2869	said [Isaac],
c2870	“Serve me,”
c2871	“and let me eat some of my son’s game,
c2872	so that I may bless you.”
c2873	Jacob brought it to him,
c2874	and he ate;
c2875	then he brought him wine,
c2876	and he drank.
c2877	Then his father Isaac said to him,
c2878	“Please come near
c2879	and kiss me,
c2880	my son.”
c2881	So he came near
c2882	and kissed him.
c2883	When Isaac smelled his clothing, ... the smell
c2884	he blessed
c2885	him and said:
c2886	“Ah,
c2887	of my son is like the smell of a field
c2888	that the LORD has blessed.
c2889	May God give to you the dew of heaven and the richness of the earth—
c2890	an abundance of grain and new wine.
c2891	May peoples serve you
c2892	and nations bow down to you.
c2893	May you be the master of your brothers,
c2894	and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.
c2895	May those who curse you be cursed,
c2896	and those who bless you be blessed.”
c2898	As soon as Isaac had finished
c2899	blessing [him]
c2901	and Jacob had left his father’s presence,
c2902	his brother Esau returned from the hunt.
c2903	He too made some tasty food,
c2904	brought it to his father,
c2905	and said to [him],
c2906	sit up
c2907	“My father,
c2908	and eat of your son’s game,
c2909	so that you may bless me.”
c2910	But his father Isaac replied,
c2911	“Who are you?”
c2912	he answered.
c2913	“I am Esau, your firstborn son,”
c2914	Isaac began to tremble violently
c2915	and said,
c2916	“Who was it, then,
c2917	who hunted the game
c2918	and brought it to me?
c2919	I ate it all
c2920	Before you came in,
c2921	and blessed him—
c2922	and indeed, he will be blessed!”
c2923	When Esau heard his father’s words,
c2924	he let out a loud and bitter cry
c2925	and said to his father,
c2926	“Bless
c2927	me too,
c2928	O my father!”
c2929	But [Isaac] replied,
c2930	“Your brother came deceitfully
c2931	and took your blessing.”
c2932	So [Esau] declared,
c2933	“Is he not rightly named Jacob?
c2934	For he has cheated me twice.
c2935	He took my birthright,
c2936	and now he has taken my blessing.”
c2937	Then he asked,
c2938	“Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?”
c2939	But Isaac answered
c2940	Esau:
c2941	“Look, I have made him your master
c2942	and given him all his relatives as servants;
c2943	I have sustained him with grain and new wine.
c2944	is left
c2945	What ... that I can do for you,
c2946	my son?”
c2947	Esau said to his father,
c2948	“Do you have only one blessing,
c2950	my father?
c2951	Bless
c2952	me too,
c2953	O my father!”
c2954	Then Esau ... aloud.
c2955	wept
c2956	His father Isaac answered him:
c2958	“Behold, your dwelling place shall be away from the richness of the land,
c2959	away from the dew of heaven above.
c2960	You shall live by the sword,
c2961	and serve your brother.
c2963	But when you rebel,
c2964	you will tear his yoke from your neck.”
c2965	Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing
c2966	his father had given him.
c2967	And Esau said in his heart:
c2968	“The days of mourning for my father are at hand;
c2969	then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
c2970	When the words of her older son Esau were relayed to Rebekah,
c2971	she sent for
c2972	her younger son Jacob
c2973	and told him,
c2974	“Look, your brother Esau is consoling himself by
c2975	plotting to kill you.
c2976	So now,
c2977	my son,
c2978	obey my voice
c2979	at once
c2980	and flee ... to my brother Laban in Haran.
c2981	Stay with him for a while,
c2982	until your brother’s fury subsides—
c2983	until your brother’s rage against you wanes
c2984	and he forgets
c2985	what you have done to him.
c2986	Then I will send for you
c2987	and bring you back from there.
c2988	Why should I lose both of you in one day?”
c2989	Then Rebekah said to Isaac,
c2990	“I am weary of my life because of these Hittite women.
c2991	If Jacob takes a Hittite wife from among them,
c2992	what good is my life?”
c2993	So Isaac called for Jacob
c2994	and blessed him.
c2995	he commanded.
c2997	“Do not take a wife from the Canaanite women,”
c2998	at once
c2999	“Go ... to Paddan-aram, to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel,
c3000	and take a wife from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.
c3001	May God Almighty bless you
c3002	and make you fruitful
c3003	and multiply you,
c3004	so that you may become a company of peoples.
c3005	And may He give the blessing of Abraham to you and your descendants,
c3006	so that you may possess the land where you dwell as a foreigner,
c3007	the land God gave to Abraham.”
c3008	So Isaac sent Jacob
c3009	to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
c3010	Now Esau learned
c3011	that Isaac had blessed Jacob
c3012	and sent him to Paddan-aram
c3013	to take a wife there,
c3015	commanding him,
c3017	“Do not marry a Canaanite woman,”
c3018	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother
c3019	and gone to Paddan-aram.
c3020	And seeing
c3021	that his father Isaac disapproved of the Canaanite women,
c3022	Esau went to Ishmael
c3023	and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth [and] daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael, in addition to the wives he already had.
c3024	Meanwhile Jacob left Beersheba
c3025	and set out for Haran.
c3026	On reaching a certain place,
c3027	he spent the night there
c3028	because the sun had set.
c3029	And taking one of the stones from that place,
c3030	he put it under his head
c3031	and lay down to sleep.
c3032	And [Jacob] dreamed
c3033	about a ladder that rested on the earth
c3034	with its top reaching up to heaven,
c3035	and God’s angels were going up
c3036	and down [the ladder].
c3037	And there at the top the LORD was standing
c3038	and saying,
c3039	“I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac.
c3040	the land
c3041	on which you now lie
c3042	I will give
c3043	you and your descendants
c3044	Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth,
c3045	and you will spread out to the west and east and north and south.
c3046	All the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.
c3047	Look, I am with you,
c3048	and I will watch over you wherever
c3049	you go,
c3050	and I will bring you back to this land.
c3051	For I will not leave
c3052	you until I have done
c3053	what I have promised you.”
c3054	When Jacob woke up,
c3055	he thought,
c3056	“Surely the LORD is in this place,
c3057	and I was unaware of it.”
c3058	And he was afraid
c3059	and said,
c3060	“How awesome [is] this place!
c3061	This is none
c3062	other than the house of God;
c3063	this is the gate of heaven!”
c3064	Early the next morning, Jacob
c3065	took the stone
c3066	that ... under his head, and he set it up
c3067	he had placed ... as a pillar.
c3068	He poured oil on top of it,
c3069	and he called that place Bethel,
c3070	though previously the city had been named Luz.
c3071	Then Jacob made a vow,
c3072	saying,
c3073	“If God will be with
c3074	me and watch over me on this journey,
c3076	and if He will provide me with food
c3077	to eat
c3078	and clothes
c3079	to wear,
c3080	so that I may return safely to my father’s house,
c3081	then the LORD will be my God.
c3082	And this stone
c3083	I have set up as a pillar
c3084	will be God’s house,
c3085	and of all
c3086	that You give me,
c3087	I will surely give You a tenth.”
c3088	Jacob resumed his journey
c3089	and came to the land of the sons of the east.
c3090	He looked
c3091	and saw a well in the field,
c3092	and there by it lay three flocks of sheep,
c3093	because the sheep were watered from this well.
c3094	And a large stone covered the mouth of the well.
c3095	When all the flocks had been gathered there,
c3096	the shepherds would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well
c3097	and water the sheep.
c3098	Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.
c3099	Jacob asked the [shepherds],
c3100	“My brothers,”
c3101	“where are you from?”
c3102	they answered.
c3103	“We are from Haran,”
c3104	Jacob asked.
c3105	“Do you know Laban grandson of Nahor?”
c3106	they replied.
c3107	“We know him,”
c3108	Jacob inquired.
c3109	“Is he well?”
c3110	they answered,
c3111	“Yes,”
c3112	“and here comes his daughter Rachel with his sheep.”
c3113	said Jacob,
c3114	“Look,” ... “it is still broad daylight;
c3115	it is not yet time
c3116	to gather the livestock.
c3117	Water the sheep
c3118	and take them back
c3119	to pasture.”
c3120	But they replied,
c3121	“We cannot,
c3122	until all the flocks have been gathered
c3123	and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well.
c3124	Then we will water the sheep.”
c3125	While he was still speaking with them,
c3126	Rachel arrived with ... sheep,
c3127	her father’s
c3128	for she was a shepherdess.
c3130	As soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his mother’s brother Laban, with Laban’s sheep, ... his uncle’s
c3131	he went up
c3132	and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well
c3133	and watered ... sheep.
c3134	Then Jacob kissed Rachel
c3135	aloud.
c3136	and wept
c3137	He told Rachel
c3138	that he was ... a relative of her father,
c3139	Rebekah’s son,
c3140	and she ran
c3141	and told her father.
c3143	When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob,
c3144	he ran out
c3145	to meet him,
c3146	and he embraced him
c3147	and kissed him.
c3148	Then he took him to his home,
c3149	and Jacob told him all that had happened.
c3150	Then Laban declared,
c3151	“You are indeed my own flesh and blood.”
c3152	After Jacob had stayed with him a month,
c3153	Laban said to him,
c3154	“Just because you are my relative,
c3155	should you work for nothing?
c3156	Tell me
c3157	what your wages should be.”
c3158	Now Laban had two daughters;
c3159	the older was named Leah,
c3160	and the younger was named Rachel.
c3161	Leah had no sparkle in her eyes,
c3162	but Rachel was shapely and beautiful.
c3163	Since Jacob loved Rachel,
c3164	he answered,
c3165	“I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”
c3166	Laban replied,
c3167	“Better
c3168	that I give her to you
c3169	than to another.
c3170	Stay here with me.”
c3171	So Jacob served seven years for Rachel,
c3172	yet it seemed [but] a few days because of his love for her.
c3173	Finally Jacob said to Laban,
c3174	“Grant me my wife,
c3175	for my time is complete,
c3176	and I want to sleep with her.”
c3177	So Laban invited all the men of that place
c3178	and prepared a feast.
c3179	But when evening came,
c3180	Laban took his daughter Leah
c3181	and gave her to Jacob,
c3182	and he slept with her.
c3183	And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah
c3184	to his daughter Leah as her maidservant.
c3185	When morning came,
c3186	there was Leah!
c3187	Jacob said to Laban.
c3188	“What have you done to me?”
c3189	“Wasn’t it for Rachel that I served you?
c3190	Why have you deceived me?”
c3191	Laban replied,
c3192	“It is not our custom here
c3193	to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older.
c3194	Finish this week’s celebration,
c3195	and we will give you the younger one ... of work.”
c3196	in return for another seven years
c3197	And Jacob did just that.
c3198	He finished the week’s celebration,
c3199	and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel
c3200	as his wife.
c3201	Laban also gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her
c3202	maidservant.
c3203	Jacob slept with Rachel as well,
c3204	and indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah.
c3205	So he worked for Laban another seven years.
c3206	When the LORD saw
c3207	that Leah was unloved,
c3208	He opened her womb;
c3209	but Rachel [was] barren.
c3210	And Leah conceived
c3211	and gave birth to a son,
c3212	and she named him Reuben,
c3213	for she said,
c3214	“The LORD has seen my affliction. Surely
c3215	my husband will love me now.”
c3216	Again she conceived
c3217	and gave birth to a son,
c3218	and she said,
c3219	“Because the LORD has heard that
c3220	I am unloved,
c3221	He has given me this [son] as well.”
c3222	So she named him Simeon.
c3223	Once again [Leah] conceived
c3224	and gave birth to a son,
c3225	and she said,
c3226	“Now at last my husband will become attached to me,
c3227	because I have borne him three sons.”
c3228	So he was named Levi.
c3229	And once more, she conceived
c3230	and gave birth to a son
c3231	and said,
c3232	“This time I will praise the LORD.”
c3233	So she named him Judah.
c3234	Then Leah stopped
c3235	having children.
c3236	When Rachel saw
c3237	that she was not bearing ... for Jacob,
c3238	any children ... she envied her sister.
c3239	she said to Jacob.
c3240	“Give me children,
c3241	or
c3242	I will die!”
c3243	Jacob became angry with Rachel
c3244	and said,
c3245	“Am I in the place of God,
c3246	who has withheld children from you?”
c3247	Then she said,
c3248	“Here is my maidservant Bilhah.
c3249	Sleep with her,
c3250	and she will bear children [for me],
c3251	so that through her I too can build a family.”
c3252	So Rachel gave [Jacob] her servant Bilhah as his wife,
c3253	and [he] slept with her,
c3254	and Bilhah conceived
c3255	and bore [him] a son.
c3256	Then Rachel said,
c3257	“God has vindicated me;
c3258	He has heard my plea
c3259	and given me a son.”
c3260	So she named him Dan.
c3261	conceived again
c3262	And Rachel’s servant Bilhah ... and bore Jacob a second son.
c3263	Then Rachel said,
c3264	“In my great struggles, I have wrestled with my sister
c3265	and won.”
c3266	So she named him Naphtali.
c3267	When Leah saw
c3268	that she had stopped
c3269	having children,
c3270	her servant Zilpah
c3271	she gave ... to Jacob as a wife.
c3272	And Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
c3273	Then Leah said,
c3274	“How fortunate!”
c3275	So she named him Gad.
c3276	When Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,
c3277	Leah said,
c3278	“How happy I am,
c3279	for the women will call me happy.”
c3280	So she named him Asher.
c3281	Now during the wheat harvest, Reuben went out
c3282	and found some mandrakes in the field.
c3283	When he brought them to his mother,
c3284	Rachel begged Leah,
c3285	“Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
c3286	But Leah replied,
c3287	“Is it not enough
c3288	that you have taken away my husband?
c3289	Now you want to take my son’s mandrakes [as well]?”
c3290	said Rachel,
c3291	“Very well,” ... “he may sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”
c3292	When Jacob came in from the field that evening,
c3293	Leah went out
c3294	to meet him
c3295	and said,
c3296	“You must come with me,
c3297	for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.”
c3298	So [he] slept with her that night.
c3299	And God listened to Leah,
c3300	and she conceived
c3301	and bore a fifth son to Jacob.
c3302	Then Leah said,
c3303	“God has rewarded
c3304	me for giving my maidservant to my husband.”
c3305	So she named him Issachar.
c3306	Again Leah conceived
c3307	and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
c3308	[she] said.
c3309	“God has given me a good gift,”
c3310	“This time my husband will honor me,
c3311	because I have borne him six sons.”
c3312	And she named him Zebulun.
c3313	After that, Leah gave birth to a daughter
c3314	and named her Dinah.
c3315	Then God remembered Rachel.
c3316	He listened to
c3317	her and opened her womb,
c3318	and she conceived
c3319	and gave birth to a son.
c3320	she said.
c3321	“God has taken away my shame,”
c3322	She named him Joseph,
c3323	and said,
c3324	“May the LORD add to me another son.”
c3325	Now
c3326	after Rachel had given birth to Joseph,
c3327	Jacob said to Laban,
c3328	“Send me on my way
c3329	so I can return to my homeland.
c3330	Give [me] my wives and children,
c3331	for whom I have served you,
c3332	and I will go on my way.
c3333	You know ... hard I have worked
c3334	how ... for you.”
c3335	But Laban replied,
c3336	“If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay.
c3337	I have learned by divination
c3338	that the LORD has blessed me because of you.”
c3339	And he added,
c3340	“Name your wages,
c3341	and I will pay them.”
c3342	Then [Jacob] answered,
c3343	“You know
c3344	how I have served you
c3345	and how [well] your livestock has fared under my care.
c3346	Indeed, ... very little
c3347	you had ... before my arrival,
c3348	but now your wealth has increased many times over.
c3349	The LORD has blessed you wherever I set foot.
c3350	But now,
c3351	when may I also provide for my own household?”
c3352	Laban asked.
c3353	“What can I give you?”
c3354	Jacob replied.
c3355	“You do not need to give me anything,”
c3356	“If you do this one thing for me,
c3357	I will keep on
c3358	shepherding ... your flock.
c3359	and keeping
c3360	Let me go through all your flocks today
c3361	and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and every spotted or speckled goat.
c3362	These will be my wages.
c3363	So my honesty will testify for me ... in the future.
c3364	when you come to check on my wages
c3365	any
c3366	goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any lambs that are not dark-colored,
c3367	If I have ... they will be considered stolen.”
c3368	said Laban.
c3369	“Agreed,”
c3370	“Let it be as you have said.”
c3371	That very day Laban removed all the streaked or spotted male goats and every speckled or spotted female goat— every one
c3372	that had any white on it—
c3373	and every dark-colored lamb,
c3374	and he placed them under the care of his sons.
c3375	Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob,
c3376	while Jacob was shepherding ... of Laban’s flocks.
c3377	the rest
c3378	Jacob, however, took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees,
c3379	and peeled [the bark], ... the white inner wood
c3380	exposing
c3381	of the branches.
c3382	Then he set ... branches
c3383	the peeled
c3384	in the watering troughs
c3385	the flocks coming in
c3386	to drink.
c3387	in front of ... So when the flocks
c3388	were in heat
c3389	and came
c3390	to drink,
c3391	they mated in front of the branches.
c3392	And they bore young [that were] streaked or speckled or spotted.
c3393	Jacob set apart the young,
c3394	but made the [rest] face the streaked dark-colored sheep in Laban’s flocks.
c3395	Then he set his own stock apart
c3396	and did not put them with Laban’s animals.
c3397	Whenever
c3398	the stronger females of the flock were in heat,
c3399	Jacob would place the branches in the troughs, in full view of the animals,
c3400	so they would breed in front of the branches.
c3402	But if the animals were weak,
c3403	he did not set out the branches.
c3404	So the weaker animals went to Laban
c3405	and the stronger ones to Jacob.
c3406	Thus [Jacob] became exceedingly prosperous.
c3407	He owned large flocks, maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.
c3408	Now Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying,
c3410	“Jacob has taken away all
c3411	that [belonged to] our father
c3413	at our father’s expense.”
c3414	and built all this wealth
c3415	And Jacob saw from the countenance of Laban
c3416	that his attitude toward him had changed.
c3417	Then the LORD said to Jacob,
c3418	“Go back to the land of your fathers and to your kindred,
c3419	and I will be with you.”
c3420	So Jacob sent word
c3421	and called Rachel and Leah to the field where his flocks were,
c3422	and he told them,
c3423	“I can see from your father’s face
c3424	that his attitude toward me has changed;
c3425	but the God of my father has been with me.
c3426	You know
c3427	that I have served your father with all my strength.
c3428	And although he has cheated me
c3429	and changed my wages ten times,
c3430	God has not allowed him
c3431	to harm me.
c3432	If he said,
c3433	‘The speckled will be your wages,’
c3434	then the whole flock bore speckled offspring.
c3435	If he said,
c3436	‘The streaked will be your wages,’
c3437	then the whole flock bore streaked offspring.
c3438	Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock
c3439	and given [them] to me.
c3440	When
c3441	the flocks were breeding,
c3442	I saw
c3443	in a dream
c3444	males
c3445	were mating with the females.
c3446	that the streaked, spotted, and speckled
c3447	In that dream the Angel of God said to me,
c3448	‘Jacob!’
c3449	And I replied,
c3450	‘Here I am.’
c3451	He said,
c3452	‘Look up,’
c3453	‘and see
c3454	that all the males
c3455	that are mating with the flock
c3456	are streaked, spotted, or speckled;
c3457	for I have seen all
c3458	that Laban has done to you.
c3459	I am the God of Bethel,
c3460	where you anointed the pillar
c3461	and made a solemn vow to Me.
c3462	Now get up
c3463	and leave this land {at once},
c3464	and return to your native land.’”
c3465	Then Rachel and Leah replied,
c3467	“Do we have any portion or inheritance left in our father’s house?
c3468	Are we not regarded by him as outsiders?
c3469	Not only has he sold us,
c3470	but he has certainly squandered the money paid for us.
c3471	Surely all the wealth
c3472	that God has taken away from our father
c3473	belongs to us and to our children.
c3474	So
c3475	whatever
c3476	God has told you.”
c3477	do
c3478	So Jacob got up
c3479	and put his children and his wives on camels,
c3480	and he drove all his livestock {before him}, along with all the possessions
c3481	he had acquired
c3483	in Paddan-aram,
c3484	to go to his father Isaac in the land in Canaan.
c3485	Now while Laban was out
c3486	shearing his sheep,
c3487	Rachel stole ... household idols.
c3488	her father’s
c3489	Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean
c3490	by not telling him
c3491	that he was running away.
c3492	So he fled with all
c3493	his possessions,
c3495	crossed the Euphrates,
c3496	and headed for the hill country of Gilead.
c3497	On the third day Laban was informed
c3498	that Jacob had fled.
c3499	So he took his kinsmen with him,
c3500	pursued Jacob for seven days,
c3501	and overtook him at Mount Gilead.
c3502	But that night God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream
c3503	and warned him,
c3504	“Be careful
c3505	not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”
c3506	and when Laban overtook [him],
c3507	Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country
c3508	of Gilead, ... he and his brothers camped [there as well].
c3509	Then Laban said to Jacob,
c3510	“What have you done?
c3511	You have deceived me
c3512	and carried off my daughters like captives of war!
c3513	Why ... secretly
c3514	did you run away
c3515	and deceive me,
c3516	without even telling me?
c3517	I would have sent you away with joy and singing, with tambourines and harps.
c3518	But you did not even let
c3519	me kiss my grandchildren and daughters { goodbye}.
c3520	Now ... a foolish thing.
c3521	you have done
c3523	I have power to do you great harm,
c3524	but last night the God of your father said to me,
c3526	‘Be careful
c3527	not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’
c3528	Now
c3529	you have gone off
c3530	because you long for your father’s house.
c3531	But why have you stolen my gods?”
c3532	Jacob answered,
c3533	I thought [you]
c3534	“I was afraid,” ... “for
c3536	would take your daughters from me by force.
c3537	If you find your gods with anyone here,
c3538	he shall not live! In the presence of our relatives,
c3539	see for yourself
c3540	if anything is yours,
c3541	and take it back.”
c3542	For Jacob did not know
c3543	that Rachel had stolen [the idols].
c3544	So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, then Leah’s tent, and then the tents of the two maidservants,
c3545	but he found nothing.
c3546	Then he left Leah’s tent
c3547	and entered Rachel’s tent.
c3548	Now Rachel had taken Laban’s household idols,
c3549	put them in the saddlebag of her camel,
c3550	and was sitting on them.
c3551	And Laban searched everything in the tent
c3552	but found nothing.
c3553	[Rachel] said to her father,
c3554	“Sir, do not be angry
c3555	that I cannot
c3556	stand up before you;
c3557	for I am having my period.”
c3558	So Laban searched,
c3559	but could not find the household idols.
c3560	Then Jacob became incensed
c3561	and challenged Laban.
c3562	he
c3563	said.
c3564	“What is my crime?”
c3565	“For what sin of mine
c3566	have you so hotly pursued me?
c3567	You have searched all my goods!
c3568	Have you found anything that belongs to you?
c3569	Put it here before my brothers and yours,
c3570	that they may judge between the two of us.
c3571	I have been with you for twenty years now.
c3572	Your sheep and goats have not miscarried,
c3573	nor have I eaten the rams of your flock.
c3574	I did not bring you anything torn by wild beasts;
c3575	I bore the loss myself.
c3576	And you demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or night.
c3577	As it was,
c3578	the heat consumed me by day
c3579	and the frost by night,
c3580	and sleep fled from my eyes.
c3581	Thus
c3582	for twenty years ... in your household—
c3583	I have served ... fourteen years for your two daughters
c3584	and six years for your flocks—
c3585	and you have changed my wages ten times!
c3586	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the One Feared by Isaac, had not been with me,
c3587	surely by now you would have sent me away empty-handed.
c3588	But God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands,
c3589	and last night He rendered judgment.”
c3590	But Laban answered
c3591	Jacob,
c3592	“[These] daughters are my daughters,
c3593	[these] sons [are] my sons,
c3594	and [these] flocks [are] my flocks!
c3595	Everything
c3596	you see is mine!
c3598	daughters
c3599	Yet what can I do today about these
c3600	of mine or the children
c3601	they have borne?
c3602	Come now,
c3603	let us make a covenant, you and I,
c3604	and let it serve as a witness between you and me.”
c3605	So Jacob picked out a stone
c3606	and set it up as a pillar,
c3607	and [he] said to his relatives,
c3608	“Gather [some] stones.”
c3609	So they took stones
c3610	and made a mound,
c3611	and there by the mound they ate.
c3612	Laban named it Jegar-sahadutha,
c3613	but Jacob called it Galeed.
c3614	Then Laban declared,
c3615	“This mound is a witness between you and me this day.”
c3616	Therefore the place was called Galeed,
c3617	and also Mizpah,
c3618	because he said,
c3619	“May the LORD keep watch between you and me
c3620	when we are absent
c3621	from one another.
c3622	If you mistreat my daughters
c3623	or take other wives,
c3624	although no one is with us,
c3625	remember
c3626	that God [is] witness between you and me.”
c3627	Laban also said to Jacob,
c3628	“Here is the mound,
c3629	and here is the pillar
c3630	I have set up between you and me.
c3631	This mound is a witness,
c3632	and this pillar is a witness,
c3633	that I will not go past this mound to harm you,
c3634	and you will not go past this mound and pillar to harm me.
c3635	May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.”
c3636	So Jacob swore by the One feared by his father Isaac.
c3637	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain
c3638	and invited his kinsmen
c3639	to eat a meal.
c3640	And after they had eaten,
c3641	they spent the night on the mountain.
c3642	Early the next morning, Laban got up
c3643	and kissed his grandchildren and daughters
c3644	and blessed them.
c3645	left
c3646	Then [he] ... to return home.
c3647	Jacob also went on his way,
c3648	and the angels of God met him.
c3649	[he] said,
c3650	When [Jacob] saw them,
c3651	“This is the camp of God.”
c3652	So he named that place Mahanaim.
c3653	Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
c3654	He instructed them,
c3655	“You are to say
c3656	to my master Esau, ... says:
c3657	‘Your servant Jacob
c3658	I have been staying with Laban
c3659	and have remained there until now.
c3660	I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, menservants, and maidservants.
c3661	I have sent
c3662	this message to inform my master,
c3663	so that I may find favor in your sight.’”
c3664	When the messengers returned to Jacob,
c3665	they said,
c3666	“We went to your brother Esau;
c3667	he is coming
c3668	to meet you—
c3669	he and four hundred men with him.”
c3670	In great fear ... Jacob
c3671	and distress,
c3672	divided ... people
c3673	his
c3674	into two camps, as well as the flocks and herds and camels.
c3675	He thought,
c3676	“If Esau comes ... one camp,
c3677	and attacks
c3678	then the other camp can escape.”
c3679	Then Jacob declared,
c3680	“O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the LORD
c3681	who told me,
c3682	‘Go back to your country and to your kindred,
c3683	and I will make you prosper,’
c3684	I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness
c3685	You have shown Your servant.
c3686	Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan,
c3687	but now I have become two camps.
c3688	Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau,
c3689	for I am afraid that
c3690	he may come
c3691	and attack me, and also the mothers and their children [with me].
c3692	But You have said,
c3693	‘I will surely make you prosper,
c3694	and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea,
c3695	too numerous to count.’”
c3696	[Jacob] spent the night there,
c3697	he selected
c3698	and from what he had brought with him,
c3699	a gift for his brother Esau:
c3700	200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams,
c3701	30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys.
c3702	He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds
c3703	and told them,
c3704	“Go on ahead of me,
c3705	and keep some distance between the herds.”
c3706	He instructed the one in the lead,
c3708	“When my brother Esau meets
c3709	you and asks,
c3711	‘To whom do you belong,
c3712	where are you going,
c3713	and whose animals are these before you?’
c3714	then you are to say,
c3715	‘They belong to your servant Jacob.
c3716	They are a gift,
c3717	sent to my lord Esau.
c3718	And behold, [Jacob] is behind us.’”
c3719	He also instructed the second, the third, and all those
c3720	following behind the herds:
c3722	Esau, you are to say the same thing to
c3723	“When you meet ... him.
c3724	to say,
c3725	You are also ... ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’”
c3726	For he thought,
c3727	“I will appease [Esau] with the gift
c3728	that is going before me.
c3729	After that I can face him,
c3730	and perhaps he will accept me.”
c3731	So [Jacob’s] gifts went on before him,
c3732	while he spent the night in the camp.
c3733	During the night Jacob got up
c3734	and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons,
c3735	and crossed the ford of Jabbok.
c3736	He took
c3737	them and sent them across the stream,
c3739	along with all his possessions.
c3740	So Jacob was left all alone,
c3741	and [there] a man wrestled with him
c3742	until daybreak.
c3743	When the man saw
c3744	that He could not overpower [Jacob],
c3745	He struck the socket of Jacob’s hip
c3746	and dislocated [it]
c3747	as they wrestled.
c3748	Then [the man] said,
c3749	“Let Me go,
c3750	for it is daybreak.”
c3751	But Jacob replied,
c3752	“I will not let You go
c3753	unless You bless me.”
c3754	the man asked.
c3755	“What is your name?”
c3756	he replied.
c3757	“Jacob,”
c3758	Then [the man] said,
c3759	“Your name will no longer be Jacob,
c3760	but Israel, because
c3761	you have struggled with God and with men,
c3762	and you have prevailed.”
c3763	Then Jacob asked him,
c3764	he replied.
c3765	“Please tell me Your name.”
c3767	“Why do you ask My name?”
c3768	And He blessed [Jacob] there.
c3769	So Jacob named the place Peniel,
c3770	saying, “Indeed, I have seen God face to face,
c3771	and yet my life was spared.”
c3772	The sun rose above him
c3773	as he passed by Penuel,
c3774	and he was limping because of his hip.
c3775	Therefore ... the Israelites do not eat the tendon
c3776	at the hip socket,
c3777	to this day
c3778	because [the man] struck Jacob’s hip socket near that tendon.
c3779	Now Jacob looked up
c3780	and saw
c3781	Esau coming
c3782	toward him with four hundred men.
c3783	So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.
c3784	He put the maidservants and their children in front,
c3785	Leah and her children next,
c3786	and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.
c3787	But [Jacob] himself went on ahead
c3788	and bowed to the ground seven times
c3789	as he approached his brother.
c3790	Esau, however, ran to him
c3792	and embraced him,
c3793	threw his arms around his neck,
c3794	and kissed him.
c3795	And they both wept.
c3796	When Esau looked up
c3797	and saw the women and children,
c3798	he asked,
c3799	“Who are these with you?”
c3800	[Jacob] answered,
c3801	“[These are] the children
c3802	God has graciously given your servant.”
c3803	Then the maidservants and their children approached
c3804	and bowed down.
c3805	Leah and her children also approached
c3806	and bowed down,
c3807	and then Joseph and Rachel approached
c3808	and bowed down.
c3809	asked Esau.
c3810	“What do you mean by sending this whole company
c3811	to meet me?”
c3812	[Jacob] answered.
c3813	“To find favor in your sight, my lord,”
c3814	Esau replied.
c3815	“I already have plenty,
c3816	my brother,”
c3817	“Keep
c3818	what belongs to you.”
c3819	But Jacob insisted,
c3820	“No, please!
c3821	If I have found favor in your sight,
c3822	then receive this gift from my hand.
c3823	For indeed, I have seen your face,
c3824	and it is like seeing the face of God,
c3825	since you have received me favorably.
c3826	Please take my present
c3827	that was brought to you,
c3828	because God has been gracious
c3829	to me and I have all I need.
c3830	So Jacob pressed him
c3831	until he accepted.
c3832	Then Esau said,
c3833	“Let us be on our way,
c3835	and I will go ahead of you.”
c3836	But Jacob replied,
c3837	“My lord knows
c3838	that the children are frail,
c3839	and I must care for sheep and cattle that are nursing their young.
c3840	If they are driven hard for even a day,
c3841	all the animals will die.
c3842	Please let my lord go ahead of his servant.
c3843	I will continue on slowly, at a comfortable pace for the livestock
c3845	and children,
c3846	until I come to my lord at Seir.”
c3847	Esau said.
c3848	“Let me leave some of ... people with you,”
c3849	my
c3850	But [Jacob] replied,
c3851	“Why do that? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”
c3852	So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir,
c3853	but Jacob went on to Succoth,
c3854	where he built a house for himself
c3855	and shelters for his livestock;
c3856	that is why the place was called Succoth.
c3857	After Jacob had come ... safely at the city of Shechem
c3858	in the land of Canaan,
c3859	from Paddan-aram, he arrived
c3860	and he camped just outside the city.
c3861	And the plot of ground ... he purchased
c3862	where he pitched his tent,
c3863	from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver.
c3864	There he set up an altar
c3865	and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
c3866	Now Dinah, the daughter Leah ... went out
c3867	had borne to Jacob,
c3868	to visit the daughters of the land.
c3869	When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her,
c3870	he took her
c3871	and lay with her
c3872	by force.
c3873	And his soul was drawn to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob.
c3874	He loved the young girl
c3875	and spoke to her tenderly.
c3876	So Shechem told his father Hamor,
c3878	“Get me this girl as a wife.”
c3879	Jacob heard
c3880	that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah,
c3881	but since his sons were with his livestock in the field,
c3882	he held his peace
c3883	until they returned.
c3884	Meanwhile, Shechem’s father Hamor came ... Jacob.
c3885	to speak with
c3886	When Jacob’s sons ... they returned from the field.
c3887	heard what had happened,
c3888	grief
c3889	They were filled with ... and fury,
c3890	because Shechem had committed an outrage in Israel
c3891	by lying with Jacob’s daughter—
c3892	a thing that should not be done.
c3893	But Hamor said to them,
c3895	“My son Shechem
c3896	longs for your daughter.
c3897	Please give her to him as his wife.
c3898	Intermarry with us;
c3899	give us your daughters,
c3900	and take our daughters for yourselves.
c3901	You may settle among us,
c3902	and the land {will} be open to you.
c3903	Live here,
c3904	move about freely,
c3905	and acquire your own property.”
c3906	Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers,
c3907	“Grant me this favor,
c3909	you whatever you ask.
c3910	and I will give
c3911	Demand a high dowry and [an expensive] gift,
c3912	and I will give you
c3913	whatever you ask.
c3914	Only give me the girl as my wife!”
c3915	Jacob’s sons answered [him] and his father Hamor deceitfully.
c3917	But because [Shechem] had defiled their sister Dinah,
c3918	they said.
c3919	“We cannot
c3920	do such a thing,”
c3921	“To give our sister
c3922	to an uncircumcised man
c3923	would be a disgrace to us.
c3924	We will consent to this on one
c3925	condition, that you become ... like us—
c3926	circumcised ... every one of your males.
c3927	Then we will give you our daughters
c3928	and take your daughters for ourselves.
c3929	We will dwell among you
c3930	and become one people.
c3931	But if you will not agree
c3932	to be circumcised,
c3933	then we will take our sister
c3934	and go.”
c3935	Their offer seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.
c3936	The young man, ... did not hesitate
c3937	to fulfill this request,
c3938	because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.
c3939	who [was] the most respected of all his father’s household,
c3940	So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city
c3941	and addressed the men of their city:
c3943	“These men
c3944	are at peace with us.
c3945	Let them live ... in our land;
c3946	and trade
c3947	[it]
c3948	indeed, ... is large enough for them.
c3949	Let us take their daughters in marriage
c3950	and give our daughters to them.
c3951	But only on this condition {will} the men agree
c3952	to dwell with us
c3953	and be one people:
c3954	if all our men are circumcised
c3955	as they are.
c3956	their livestock, their possessions, and all ... animals [become ours]?
c3957	Will not ... their
c3958	Only let us consent to them,
c3959	and they will dwell among us.”
c3960	All the men who went out of the city gate listened to Hamor and his son Shechem,
c3961	and every male of the city was circumcised.
c3962	Three days later, ... they were
c3963	while ... still in pain,
c3964	two of Jacob’s sons (Dinah’s brothers Simeon and Levi) took
c3965	their swords,
c3966	went into the unsuspecting city,
c3967	and slaughtered every male.
c3968	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords,
c3969	took Dinah out of Shechem’s house,
c3970	and went away.
c3971	Jacob’s other sons came upon the slaughter
c3972	and looted the city,
c3973	because their sister had been defiled.
c3974	their flocks and herds and donkeys,
c3975	and everything else in the city
c3976	or in the field.
c3977	They took
c3978	They carried off all their possessions and women and children, ... everything
c3979	and they plundered
c3981	in [their] houses.
c3982	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi,
c3983	“You have brought trouble upon me
c3984	by making me repugnant to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people of this land.
c3985	We are few in number;
c3986	if they unite against me
c3987	and attack me,
c3988	I and my household will be destroyed.”
c3989	But [Simeon and Levi] answered,
c3990	“Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”
c3991	Then God said to Jacob,
c3992	“Arise,
c3993	go up to Bethel,
c3994	and settle there.
c3995	Build an altar there to the God
c3996	who appeared to
c3997	you when you fled from your brother Esau.”
c3998	So Jacob told his household and all
c3999	who were with him,
c4000	“Get rid of the foreign gods
c4001	that are among you.
c4002	Purify yourselves
c4003	and change your garments.
c4004	Then let us arise
c4005	and go to Bethel.
c4006	I will build an altar there to the God
c4007	who answered me in my day of distress.
c4008	He has been with me wherever
c4009	I have gone.”
c4010	So they gave Jacob all ... foreign gods
c4011	their
c4012	and [all their] earrings,
c4014	and Jacob buried them under the oak
c4015	near Shechem.
c4016	As they set out,
c4017	a terror from God fell over ... cities,
c4018	the surrounding
c4019	so that they did not pursue Jacob’s sons.
c4020	So Jacob ... arrived in Luz
c4021	in the land of Canaan.
c4022	(that is, Bethel)
c4023	and everyone
c4024	with him
c4025	There Jacob built an altar,
c4026	and he called that place El-bethel,
c4027	because it was there that God had revealed Himself to him
c4028	as he fled from his brother.
c4029	Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died
c4030	and was buried under the oak below Bethel.
c4031	So [Jacob] named [it] Allon-bachuth.
c4032	God appeared to [him] again
c4033	After [Jacob] had returned from Paddan-aram,
c4034	and blessed him.
c4035	And God said to him,
c4036	“Your name is Jacob;
c4037	you will no longer be called Jacob,
c4038	but your name will be Israel.”
c4039	So [God] named him Israel.
c4040	And God told him,
c4041	“I am God Almighty.
c4042	Be fruitful
c4043	and multiply.
c4044	A nation— even a company of nations— shall come from you,
c4045	and kings shall descend from you.
c4046	The land
c4047	that ... to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you,
c4048	I gave
c4049	and I will give this land to your descendants after you.”
c4050	Then God went up from him at the place
c4051	where He had spoken with him.
c4052	So Jacob set up a pillar in the place
c4053	where [God] had spoken to him—
c4054	a stone marker—
c4055	and he poured out a drink offering on it
c4056	and anointed it with oil.
c4057	Jacob called the place
c4058	where God had spoken with
c4059	him Bethel.
c4060	Later, they set out from Bethel,
c4061	and while they were still some distance
c4062	from Ephrath,
c4063	Rachel began to give birth,
c4064	was difficult.
c4065	and her labor
c4066	During
c4067	her severe
c4068	labor,
c4069	the midwife said to her,
c4070	“Do not be afraid,
c4071	for you are having another son.”
c4072	And
c4073	with her last breath—
c4074	for she was dying—
c4075	she named him Ben-oni.
c4076	But his father called him Benjamin.
c4077	So Rachel died
c4078	and was buried on the way to Ephrath
c4079	(that is, Bethlehem).
c4080	Jacob set up a pillar on her grave;
c4081	it marks Rachel’s tomb to this day.
c4082	Israel again set out
c4083	and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder.
c4084	While
c4085	Israel was living in that region,
c4086	Reuben went in
c4087	and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah,
c4088	and Israel heard about it.
c4089	Jacob had twelve sons:
c4090	The sons of Leah were Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
c4091	The sons of Rachel [were] Joseph and Benjamin.
c4092	The sons of Rachel’s maidservant Bilhah [were] Dan and Naphtali.
c4093	And the sons of Leah’s maidservant Zilpah [were] Gad and Asher.
c4094	These are the sons of Jacob,
c4095	who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
c4096	Jacob returned to his father Isaac at Mamre, near Kiriath-arba
c4097	(that is, Hebron),
c4098	where Abraham and Isaac had dwelt.
c4099	And Isaac lived 180 years.
c4100	Then [he] breathed his last
c4101	and died
c4102	and was gathered to his people, old and full of years.
c4103	And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
c4104	This is the account of Esau
c4105	(that is, Edom).
c4106	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan:
c4107	Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
c4108	and Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
c4109	And Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau,
c4110	Basemath gave birth to Reuel,
c4111	and Oholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
c4112	These [were] the sons of Esau,
c4113	who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
c4114	Later, Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the people of his household, along with his livestock, all his [other] animals, and all the property
c4115	he had acquired in Canaan, ... a land
c4116	and he moved to ... far away from his brother Jacob.
c4117	For their possessions were too great
c4118	for them to dwell together;
c4119	the land where they stayed could not
c4120	support them
c4121	because of their livestock.
c4122	So Esau ... settled in the hill country of Seir.
c4124	(that is, Edom)
c4125	This is the account of Esau, the father of the Edomites, in the hill country of Seir.
c4126	These are the names of Esau’s sons:
c4127	Eliphaz son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel son of Esau’s wife Basemath.
c4128	The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
c4129	Additionally, Timna, a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz,
c4130	gave birth to Amalek.
c4131	These are the grandsons of Esau’s wife Adah.
c4132	These the sons of Reuel:
c4133	Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.
c4134	They are the grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
c4135	These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah, daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon,
c4136	whom she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
c4137	These are the chiefs among the sons of Esau:
c4138	the sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau [are] Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,
c4139	Korah, Gatam, and Amalek.
c4140	They are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom,
c4141	[and] they are the grandsons of Adah.
c4142	These are the sons of Esau’s son Reuel:
c4143	Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. ... are the chiefs
c4144	They ... descended from Reuel in the land of Edom,
c4145	[and] they are the grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
c4146	These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah:
c4147	Chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah;
c4148	they are the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
c4149	All these are the sons of Esau
c4150	and they were their chiefs.
c4151	(that is, Edom),
c4152	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the land:
c4153	Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
c4154	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan;
c4155	they are the chiefs of the Horites, the descendants of Seir in the land of Edom.
c4156	The sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman.
c4157	Timna was Lotan’s sister.
c4158	These are the sons of Shobal:
c4159	Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
c4160	These are the sons of Zibeon:
c4161	Aiah and Anah.
c4162	(This was Anah
c4163	who found the hot springs in the wilderness
c4164	as he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.)
c4165	These are the children of Anah:
c4166	Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
c4167	These are the sons of Dishon:
c4168	Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
c4169	These are the sons of Ezer:
c4170	Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
c4171	These are the sons of Dishan:
c4172	Uz and Aran.
c4173	These are the chiefs of the Horites:
c4174	Chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
c4175	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan; ... according to their divisions
c4176	they are the chiefs of the Horites, ... in the land of Seir.
c4177	These are the kings
c4178	who reigned in the land of Edom
c4179	before any king ruled over the Israelites:
c4180	Bela son of Beor ruled in Edom;
c4181	the name of his city was Dinhabah.
c4182	When Bela died,
c4183	Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place.
c4184	When Jobab died,
c4185	Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.
c4186	When Husham died,
c4187	Hadad son of Bedad, ... reigned in his place.
c4188	who defeated Midian in the field of Moab,
c4189	And the name of his city was Avith.
c4190	When Hadad died,
c4191	Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place.
c4192	When Samlah died,
c4193	Shaul from Rehoboth on the Euphrates reigned in his place.
c4194	When Shaul died,
c4195	Baal-hanan son of Achbor reigned in his place.
c4196	When Baal-hanan son of Achbor died,
c4197	Hadad reigned in his place.
c4198	His city was named Pau,
c4199	and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.
c4200	These are the names of Esau’s chiefs, according to their families and regions, by their names:
c4201	Chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
c4202	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
c4203	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,
c4204	Magdiel, and Iram.
c4205	These [were] the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they possessed.
c4206	Esau was the father of the Edomites.
c4207	Now Jacob lived in the land where his father had resided, the land of Canaan.
c4208	This is the account of Jacob.
c4209	When Joseph [was] seventeen years old, he was
c4210	tending the flock with his brothers,
c4211	the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives,
c4212	and he brought their father a bad report about them.
c4213	Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons,
c4214	because Joseph had been born to him in his old age;
c4215	so he made him a robe of many colors.
c4216	When [Joseph’s] brothers saw
c4217	that their father loved him more than any [of them],
c4218	they hated him
c4219	and could not
c4220	speak a kind word to him.
c4221	Then Joseph had a dream,
c4222	and when he told it to his brothers,
c4223	all the more.
c4224	they hated him
c4225	He said to them,
c4226	“Listen to this
c4227	dream I had:
c4228	We were binding sheaves of grain in the field,
c4229	and suddenly my sheaf rose
c4230	and stood upright,
c4231	while your sheaves gathered around
c4232	and bowed down to [mine].”
c4233	his brothers asked.
c4234	“Do you intend to reign over us?”
c4235	“Will you actually rule us?”
c4236	even more
c4237	So they hated him ... because of his dream and his statements.
c4238	Then [Joseph] had another dream
c4239	and told it to his brothers.
c4240	he said,
c4241	“Look,” ... “I had another dream,
c4242	and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
c4243	He told his father and brothers,
c4244	but his father rebuked him.
c4245	he said.
c4246	“What is this dream ... you have had?”
c4247	that
c4248	“Will your mother and brothers and I actually come
c4249	and bow down to the ground before you?”
c4250	And his brothers were jealous of him,
c4251	but his father kept in mind what he had said.
c4252	Some time later, [Joseph’s] brothers had gone
c4253	to pasture their father’s flocks near Shechem.
c4254	Israel said to [him],
c4255	“Are not your brothers pasturing the flocks at Shechem?
c4256	Get ready;
c4257	I am sending you to them.”
c4258	Joseph replied.
c4259	“I am ready,”
c4260	Then [Israel] told him,
c4261	“Go now
c4262	and see how your brothers and the flocks are faring,
c4263	and bring word back to me.”
c4264	So he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron.
c4265	And when [Joseph] arrived in Shechem,
c4266	a man found him
c4267	wandering in the field
c4268	and asked,
c4270	“What are you looking for?”
c4271	Joseph replied.
c4272	“I am looking for my brothers,”
c4273	“Can you please tell me
c4274	where they are pasturing their flocks?”
c4275	the man answered.
c4276	“They have moved on from here,”
c4277	“I heard
c4278	them say,
c4279	‘Let us go to Dothan.’”
c4280	So Joseph set out after his brothers
c4281	and found them at Dothan.
c4282	Now [Joseph’s brothers] saw him in the distance,
c4283	and before he arrived,
c4284	they plotted
c4285	to kill him.
c4286	they said
c4287	to one another.
c4288	“Here comes that dreamer!”
c4289	now,
c4290	“Come
c4291	let us kill
c4292	him and throw him into one of the pits.
c4293	We can say
c4294	that a vicious animal has devoured him.
c4295	Then we shall see
c4296	what becomes of his dreams!”
c4297	When Reuben heard [this],
c4298	he tried to rescue [Joseph] from their hands.
c4299	he said.
c4300	“Let us not take his life,”
c4301	Reuben said this
c4302	“Do not shed [his] blood.
c4303	Throw him into this pit
c4304	in the wilderness,
c4305	but do not lay a hand on him.”
c4306	so that he could rescue [Joseph] from their hands
c4307	and return him to his father.
c4308	So
c4309	when Joseph came to his brothers,
c4310	they stripped [him] of his robe— the robe of many colors
c4311	he was wearing—
c4312	and they took
c4313	him and threw him into the pit.
c4314	Now the pit was empty,
c4315	with no water in it.
c4316	And as they sat down
c4317	to eat a meal,
c4318	they looked up
c4320	and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead.
c4321	Their camels were carrying spices, balm, and myrrh
c4322	on their way
c4323	down to Egypt.
c4324	Then Judah said to his brothers,
c4325	“What profit will we gain
c4326	if we kill our brother
c4327	and cover up his blood?
c4328	Come,
c4329	let us sell him to the Ishmaelites
c4330	and not lay a hand on him;
c4331	for he is our brother, our own flesh.”
c4332	And they agreed.
c4333	So when the Midianite ... passed by,
c4334	traders
c4335	his brothers pulled
c4336	Joseph out of the pit
c4337	and sold him for twenty [shekels] of silver to the Ishmaelites,
c4338	who took [him] to Egypt.
c4339	When Reuben returned to the pit
c4340	and saw that Joseph was not there,
c4341	he tore his clothes,
c4342	returned to his brothers,
c4343	and said,
c4344	“The boy
c4345	is gone!
c4346	What am I going to do?”
c4348	Then they took Joseph’s robe,
c4349	slaughtered a young goat,
c4350	and dipped the robe in its blood.
c4351	They sent the robe of many colors
c4352	to their father
c4353	and said,
c4354	“We found this.
c4355	Examine it to see whether
c4356	it [is] your son’s robe
c4357	or not.”
c4358	His father recognized it
c4359	and said,
c4360	“It is my son’s robe!
c4361	A vicious animal has devoured him.
c4362	Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!”
c4363	Then Jacob tore his clothes,
c4364	put sackcloth around his waist,
c4365	and mourned for his son many days.
c4366	All his sons and daughters
c4367	tried to comfort him,
c4368	but he refused
c4369	to be comforted.
c4370	“No, ” he said.
c4371	“I will go down ... for my son.”
c4372	to Sheol mourning
c4373	So his father wept for him.
c4374	Meanwhile, the Midianites sold [Joseph] in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh [and] captain of the guard.
c4375	About that time,
c4376	Judah left his brothers
c4377	and settled near a man ... an Adullamite.
c4378	named Hirah,
c4379	There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man
c4380	named Shua,
c4381	and he took her as a wife
c4382	and slept with her.
c4383	So she conceived
c4384	and gave birth to a son,
c4385	and [Judah] named him Er.
c4386	Again she conceived
c4387	and gave birth to a son,
c4388	and she named him Onan.
c4389	another
c4390	Then she gave birth to ... son
c4391	and named him Shelah;
c4392	it was at Chezib
c4393	that she gave birth to him.
c4394	Now Judah acquired a wife for Er, his firstborn,
c4395	and her name was Tamar.
c4396	But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the LORD’s sight;
c4397	so the LORD put him to death.
c4398	Then Judah said to Onan,
c4399	“Sleep with your brother’s wife.
c4400	Perform your duty as her brother-in-law
c4401	and raise up offspring for your brother.”
c4402	But Onan knew
c4403	that the offspring would not belong to him;
c4405	so whenever he would sleep with his brother’s wife,
c4406	he would spill his seed on the ground
c4407	so that he would not produce offspring for his brother.
c4408	was evil in the LORD’s sight,
c4409	What he did
c4410	so He put [Onan] to death as well.
c4411	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar,
c4412	“Live as a widow in your father’s house
c4413	until my son Shelah grows up.”
c4414	For he thought,
c4415	“He may die too, like his brothers.”
c4416	So Tamar went
c4417	to live in her father’s house.
c4418	After a long time
c4419	Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died.
c4420	When Judah had finished mourning,
c4421	he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah.
c4422	When Tamar was told,
c4424	“Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah
c4425	to shear his sheep,”
c4426	she removed her widow’s garments, ... is on
c4427	with a veil to disguise herself,
c4428	covered her face
c4429	and sat at the entrance to Enaim,
c4430	which ... the way to Timnah.
c4431	For she saw
c4432	that although Shelah had grown up,
c4433	she had not been given to him as a wife.
c4434	When Judah saw her,
c4435	he thought she was a prostitute
c4436	because she had covered her face.
c4437	he went over to ... you.”
c4438	her and said,
c4439	“Come now,
c4440	let me sleep with ... you?”
c4441	Not realizing
c4442	that she was his daughter-in-law,
c4443	she asked.
c4444	“What will you give
c4445	me for sleeping with
c4446	[Judah] answered.
c4447	“I will send you a young goat from my flock,”
c4448	But she replied,
c4449	“Only if you leave me something as a pledge
c4450	until you send it.”
c4451	he asked.
c4452	“What pledge
c4453	should I give you?”
c4454	She answered,
c4455	“Your seal and your cord, and the staff
c4456	in your hand.”
c4457	So he gave them to her
c4458	and slept with her,
c4459	and she became pregnant by him.
c4460	After she got up
c4461	and left,
c4462	she removed her veil
c4463	and put on her widow’s garments again.
c4464	Now when Judah sent his friend [Hirah] the Adullamite with the young goat
c4465	to collect the items he had left with the woman,
c4466	he could not find her.
c4467	He asked the men of that place,
c4468	they answered.
c4469	“Where is the temple prostitute
c4470	who was beside the road at Enaim?”
c4472	“No temple prostitute has been here,”
c4473	So [Hirah] returned to Judah
c4474	and said,
c4475	“I could not find her,
c4476	and furthermore, the men of that place said,
c4477	‘No temple prostitute has been here.’”
c4478	Judah replied.
c4479	“Let her keep the items,”
c4480	“Otherwise we will become a laughingstock.
c4481	After all, I did send her this young goat,
c4482	but you could not find her.”
c4483	About three months later,
c4484	Judah was told,
c4485	replied.
c4486	“Your daughter-in-law Tamar has prostituted herself,
c4487	and now she is pregnant.”
c4488	Judah
c4489	“Bring her out!”
c4490	“Let her be burned to death!”
c4491	As she was being brought out,
c4492	she sent ... to her father-in-law:
c4493	And she added,
c4495	by the man to whom these items belong.”
c4496	“I am pregnant
c4497	a message
c4498	“Please examine them.
c4499	Whose seal and cord and staff are these?”
c4500	Judah recognized [the items]
c4501	and said,
c4502	“She is more righteous than I,
c4503	since I did not give her to my son Shelah.”
c4504	And he did not ... again.
c4505	have relations with her
c4506	came
c4507	When the time ... for [Tamar] to give birth,
c4508	there were twins in her womb.
c4509	And
c4510	as she was giving birth,
c4511	one of them put out his hand;
c4512	so the midwife took
c4513	a scarlet thread and tied [it] around his wrist.
c4514	she announced.
c4515	“This one came out first,”
c4517	But when he pulled his hand back
c4518	and his brother came out,
c4519	she said,
c4520	“You have broken out first!”
c4521	So he was named Perez.
c4522	Then his brother came out
c4523	with the scarlet thread around his wrist,
c4524	and he was named Zerah.
c4525	Meanwhile, Joseph had been taken down to Egypt,
c4526	where an Egyptian named Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites
c4527	who had taken him there.
c4528	And the LORD was with Joseph,
c4529	and he became a successful man,
c4530	serving in the household of his Egyptian master.
c4531	When his master saw
c4532	that the LORD [was] with him
c4533	in all
c4534	he did,
c4535	[and] made him prosper
c4536	Joseph found favor in his sight
c4537	and became his personal attendant.
c4538	Potiphar put him in charge of his household
c4539	with everything
c4540	he owned.
c4541	and entrusted him
c4542	was
c4543	From the time that he put [Joseph] in charge of his household and all
c4544	he owned,
c4545	the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s household on account of [him].
c4546	The LORD’s blessing ... on everything
c4547	he owned, both in his house and in his field.
c4548	So [Potiphar] left all
c4549	that he owned
c4550	in Joseph’s care;
c4551	he did not concern himself with anything
c4552	except the food
c4553	he ate.
c4554	Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,
c4555	and after some time
c4556	his master’s wife cast her eyes on Joseph
c4557	and said,
c4558	“Sleep with me.”
c4559	But he refused.
c4560	he said to his master’s wife,
c4561	“Look,” ... “with me here, my master does not concern himself
c4562	with anything in his house,
c4563	everything
c4564	he owns to
c4565	and he has entrusted ... my care.
c4566	No one in this house is greater than I am.
c4567	He has withheld nothing from
c4568	me except you,
c4569	because you are his wife.
c4570	So how could I do such a great evil
c4571	and sin against God?”
c4572	Although
c4573	[Potiphar’s wife] spoke to Joseph day after day,
c4574	he refused
c4575	to go to bed with her
c4576	[or] be with her.
c4577	One day, however,
c4578	[Joseph] went into the house
c4579	to attend to his work,
c4580	and not a single household servant [was] inside.
c4581	She grabbed [Joseph] by his cloak
c4582	and said,
c4583	“Sleep with me!”
c4584	But leaving his garment in her hand,
c4585	he escaped
c4586	and ran outside.
c4588	When she saw
c4589	that he had left his cloak in her hand
c4590	and had run out [of the house],
c4591	she called her household servants.
c4592	she said,
c4594	“Look,”
c4595	“this Hebrew has been brought to us
c4596	to make sport of us.
c4597	He came to me
c4598	so he could sleep with me,
c4599	but I screamed as loud as I could.
c4601	When he heard
c4602	me scream for help,
c4604	he left his cloak beside me
c4605	and ran
c4606	out [of the house].”
c4607	So [Potiphar’s wife] kept Joseph’s garment beside her
c4608	until his master came home.
c4609	Then she told him the same story:
c4611	“The Hebrew slave you brought us
c4612	came to me
c4613	to make sport of me,
c4615	but when I screamed for help,
c4617	he left his cloak beside me
c4618	and ran out [of the house].”
c4619	When
c4620	his master heard the story his wife
c4621	told him,
c4622	saying,
c4623	“This is what your slave did to me,”
c4624	he burned with anger.
c4625	So Joseph’s master took him
c4626	and had him thrown into the prison where
c4627	the king’s prisoners were confined.
c4628	While [Joseph] was there in the prison,
c4629	the LORD was with [him]
c4630	and extended kindness to him.
c4631	He granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden,
c4632	[who] put all those held ... under Joseph’s authority,
c4633	in the prison
c4634	for all
c4635	responsible ... that ... there.
c4636	so that he was ... was done
c4637	The warden did not concern himself with anything under Joseph’s authority,
c4638	because the LORD was with him
c4640	in whatever he did.
c4641	and gave him success
c4642	Some time later,
c4643	the king’s cupbearer and baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.
c4644	Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
c4645	and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, the same prison
c4646	where Joseph was confined.
c4647	The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph,
c4648	and he became their personal attendant.
c4649	After they had been in custody for some time,
c4650	both ... had a dream
c4651	of these men— ... on the same night,
c4652	and each dream had its own meaning.
c4653	cupbearer and baker,
c4654	the Egyptian king’s ... who
c4655	were being held in the prison—
c4656	When Joseph came to them in the morning,
c4657	he saw
c4658	that they looked distraught.
c4659	So he asked Pharaoh’s officials
c4660	who were in custody with him in his master’s house,
c4662	“Why are your faces so downcast today?”
c4663	they replied,
c4664	“We both had dreams,”
c4665	“but there is no one to interpret them.”
c4666	Then Joseph said to them,
c4667	“Don’t interpretations belong to God?
c4668	Tell me your dreams.”
c4669	So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream:
c4671	“In my dream
c4672	there was a vine before me,
c4673	and on the vine were three branches.
c4674	As it
c4675	budded, its blossoms opened
c4676	and its clusters ripened into grapes.
c4677	Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand,
c4678	and I took the grapes,
c4679	squeezed them into [his] cup,
c4680	and placed the cup into [his] hand.”
c4681	Joseph replied,
c4682	“This [is] the interpretation:
c4683	The three branches
c4684	are three days.
c4685	Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head
c4686	and restore your position.
c4687	You will put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, just as you did
c4688	when you were his cupbearer.
c4689	But ... remember me
c4690	when it goes well for you,
c4691	please ... and show me kindness
c4692	by mentioning me to Pharaoh,
c4693	that he might bring me out of this prison.
c4694	For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews,
c4695	and even here I have done nothing
c4696	for which they should have put me in this dungeon.”
c4697	When the chief baker saw
c4698	that the interpretation was favorable,
c4699	he said to Joseph,
c4700	“I too
c4701	had a dream:
c4702	There were three baskets of white bread on my head.
c4703	In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh,
c4704	but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”
c4705	Joseph replied,
c4707	“This is the interpretation:
c4708	The three baskets
c4709	are three days.
c4710	Within three days Pharaoh will lift your head off of you
c4711	and hang you on a tree.
c4712	Then the birds will eat the flesh of your body.”
c4713	On the third day, ... birthday,
c4714	which was Pharaoh’s
c4715	he held a feast for all his officials,
c4716	and in [their presence] he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.
c4717	Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position,
c4718	so that he once again placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.
c4719	But Pharaoh hanged the chief baker,
c4720	just as Joseph had interpreted [the dream] to them.
c4721	The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph;
c4722	he forgot all about him.
c4723	After two full years had passed,
c4724	Pharaoh had a dream:
c4725	He was standing beside the Nile,
c4726	when seven cows, sleek and well-fed, came up from the river
c4727	and began to graze among the reeds.
c4728	After them, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up from the Nile
c4729	and stood beside the [other] cows on the bank of the river.
c4730	And the cows [that were] sickly and thin ate up the seven sleek, well-fed cows.
c4731	Then Pharaoh woke up,
c4732	but he fell back asleep
c4733	and dreamed a second time:
c4734	Seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, came up on one stalk.
c4735	After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the east wind.
c4736	And the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven plump, ripe ones.
c4737	Then Pharaoh awoke
c4738	and realized it was a dream.
c4739	In the morning
c4740	his spirit was troubled,
c4741	so he summoned
c4742	all the magicians and wise men of Egypt.
c4743	Pharaoh told them his dreams,
c4744	but no one
c4745	could interpret them for him.
c4746	Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh,
c4748	“Today I recall my failures.
c4749	Pharaoh was once angry with his servants,
c4750	and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guard.
c4751	One night both [the chief baker] and I had dreams,
c4752	[and] each dream had its own meaning.
c4754	Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard.
c4755	We told him [our dreams]
c4756	and he interpreted [them] for us
c4757	individually.
c4758	And it happened
c4759	to us just as he had interpreted:
c4761	I was restored to my position,
c4762	and the other man was hanged.”
c4763	So Pharaoh sent for
c4764	Joseph,
c4765	who was quickly brought out of the dungeon.
c4766	After he had shaved
c4767	and changed his clothes,
c4768	he went in before Pharaoh.
c4769	Pharaoh said to Joseph,
c4770	“I had a dream,
c4771	and no one can interpret it.
c4772	But I have received word about you
c4774	that when you hear a dream
c4775	you can interpret it.”
c4776	Joseph replied,
c4778	“I myself cannot do it,”
c4779	“but God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.”
c4780	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph:
c4781	“In my dream
c4782	I was standing on the bank of the Nile,
c4783	when seven cows, well-fed and sleek, came up from the river
c4784	and began to graze among the reeds.
c4785	After them, seven other cows, sickly, ugly, and thin, came up.
c4786	I have never seen such ugly [cows] in all the land of Egypt!
c4787	Then the thin, ugly cows devoured the seven well-fed cows that were there first.
c4788	When they had devoured them, however,
c4789	no one could tell
c4790	that they had [done so];
c4791	their appearance was as ugly
c4792	as it had been before.
c4793	Then I awoke.
c4794	In my dream I also saw
c4795	seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, growing on a single stalk.
c4796	After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted— withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind.
c4797	And the thin heads of grain swallowed the seven plump ones.
c4798	I told this [dream] to the magicians,
c4799	but no
c4800	one could explain it to me.”
c4801	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh,
c4802	“The dreams of Pharaoh
c4803	are one and the same.
c4804	God ... what He is about to do.
c4805	has revealed to Pharaoh
c4806	The seven good cows
c4807	are seven years,
c4808	and the seven ripe heads of grain
c4809	are seven years.
c4810	The dreams have the same meaning.
c4811	Moreover, the seven thin, ugly cows
c4812	that came up after them
c4813	are seven years, and so are
c4814	the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind—
c4815	they are seven years of famine.
c4816	It
c4817	is just as I said to Pharaoh:
c4818	God ... what He is about to do.
c4819	has shown Pharaoh
c4820	Behold, seven years ... are coming
c4821	of great abundance ... throughout the land of Egypt,
c4822	but seven years of famine will follow them.
c4823	Then all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten
c4824	and the famine will devastate the land.
c4825	The abundance in the land will not be remembered, since the famine that follows it
c4826	[will be] so severe.
c4827	Moreover, on ... the dream being given to Pharaoh in two versions,
c4828	the basis of ... the matter has been decreed by God,
c4829	and He ... shortly.
c4830	will carry it out
c4831	Now therefore,
c4832	Pharaoh should look for a discerning and wise man
c4833	and set him over the land of Egypt.
c4834	Let Pharaoh take action
c4835	and appoint commissioners over the land
c4836	to take a fifth of [its] harvest during the seven years of abundance.
c4837	let them collect all the excess food from these good years, that they may come
c4838	Under the authority of Pharaoh, ... and lay up the grain
c4839	as food in the cities.
c4840	to be preserved
c4841	This food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine
c4842	to come upon the land of Egypt.
c4843	Then the country will not perish in the famine.”
c4844	This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his officials.
c4845	So Pharaoh asked [them],
c4846	“Can we find anyone like this man,
c4847	in whom the Spirit of God [abides]?”
c4848	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,
c4849	“Since God has made all this known to you,
c4850	there is no one as discerning and wise as you.
c4851	You shall be in charge of my house,
c4852	and all my people are to obey your commands.
c4853	Only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you.”
c4854	Pharaoh also told Joseph,
c4855	“vvv
c4856	I hereby place you over all the land of Egypt.”
c4857	Then Pharaoh removed the signet ring from his finger,
c4858	put it on Joseph’s finger,
c4859	clothed him in garments of fine linen,
c4860	and placed a gold chain around his neck.
c4861	He had Joseph ride in his second chariot,
c4863	with men calling out before him,
c4864	“Bow the knee!”
c4865	So he placed him over all the land of Egypt.
c4866	And Pharaoh declared to Joseph,
c4867	“I am Pharaoh,
c4868	but without your permission, no one in all the land of Egypt shall lift his hand or foot.”
c4869	Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah,
c4870	and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife.
c4871	And Joseph took charge over [all] the land of Egypt.
c4872	Now Joseph was thirty years old
c4873	when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
c4874	And Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence
c4875	and traveled throughout the land of Egypt.
c4876	During the seven years of abundance, the land brought forth bountifully.
c4877	During those seven years, Joseph collected all the excess food
c4878	in the land of Egypt
c4879	and stored it in the cities.
c4880	every city ... the food from the fields
c4881	around it.
c4882	In ... he laid up
c4883	So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance, like the sand of the sea,
c4884	that he stopped
c4885	keeping track of it;
c4886	for it was beyond measure.
c4887	two sons were born to Joseph
c4888	Before the years of famine arrived,
c4889	by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
c4890	Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh,
c4891	saying, “God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father’s household.”
c4892	And the second [son] he named Ephraim,
c4893	saying, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”
c4894	When the seven years of abundance ... came to an end,
c4895	in Egypt
c4896	the seven years of famine began,
c4898	just as Joseph had said.
c4899	And although there was famine in every country,
c4900	there was food throughout the land of Egypt.
c4901	When extreme hunger came to all the land of Egypt
c4902	and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food,
c4903	[he] told all the Egyptians,
c4904	“Go to Joseph
c4905	whatever he tells you.”
c4906	and do
c4907	When the famine had spread over all the land,
c4908	Joseph opened up all
c4910	the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians;
c4911	for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
c4912	And every nation came ... in Egypt
c4913	to Joseph ... to buy grain,
c4914	because the famine was severe over all the earth.
c4915	When Jacob learned
c4916	that there was grain in Egypt,
c4917	he said to his sons,
c4918	“Why are you staring at one another?”
c4919	he added,
c4920	“Look,” ... “I have heard
c4921	that there is grain in Egypt.
c4922	Go down there
c4923	and buy some for us,
c4924	so that we may live
c4925	and not die.”
c4926	So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down
c4927	to buy grain from Egypt.
c4928	But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers,
c4929	for he said,
c4930	“I am afraid that harm might befall him.”
c4931	So the sons of Israel ... came
c4932	were among ... to buy grain,
c4933	those who
c4934	since the famine had [also] spread to the land of Canaan.
c4935	Now Joseph
c4936	was the ruler of the land,
c4937	who
c4938	sold grain to all its people.
c4939	So when [his] brothers arrived,
c4940	they bowed down before him
c4941	with their faces to the ground.
c4942	When Joseph saw his brothers,
c4943	he recognized them,
c4944	but he treated them as strangers
c4945	and spoke harshly to them.
c4946	he asked.
c4947	“Where have you come from?”
c4948	they replied.
c4949	“From the land of Canaan,”
c4950	“[We are here] to buy food.”
c4951	Although Joseph recognized his brothers,
c4952	they did not recognize him.
c4953	Joseph remembered his dreams
c4954	about them
c4955	and said,
c4956	“You are spies!
c4957	to see if our land [is] vulnerable.”
c4958	You have come
c4959	they replied.
c4960	“Not so,
c4961	my lord,”
c4962	“Your servants have come
c4963	to buy food.
c4964	are all
c4965	We ... sons of one man.
c4966	honest [men],
c4967	Your servants are ... not spies.”
c4968	he told them.
c4969	“No,”
c4970	“You have come ... if our land [is] vulnerable.”
c4971	to see
c4972	But they answered,
c4973	“Your servants are twelve
c4974	brothers,
c4975	the sons of one man in the land of Canaan.
c4976	The youngest is now with our father,
c4977	and one
c4978	is no more.”
c4979	Then Joseph said to them,
c4981	“Just as I said,
c4983	you are spies!
c4984	And this is how you will be tested:
c4985	As surely as Pharaoh lives,
c4986	you shall not leave this
c4987	place unless your youngest brother comes here.
c4988	Send one of your number
c4989	to get your brother;
c4990	the rest of you will be confined
c4991	of your words may be tested.
c4992	so that the truth
c4993	If they are untrue,
c4994	then as surely as Pharaoh lives,
c4995	you are spies!”
c4996	So Joseph imprisoned them for three days,
c4997	and on the third day [he] said to them,
c4998	“Do this
c4999	and you will live,
c5000	[for] I fear God.
c5001	If you are honest,
c5002	leave one of your brothers in custody
c5003	while the rest of you go
c5004	and take back grain to relieve the hunger of your households.
c5005	Then bring your youngest brother to me
c5006	so that your words can be verified,
c5007	that you may not die.”
c5008	And to this they consented.
c5009	Then they said
c5010	to one another,
c5011	“Surely we are being punished because of our brother.
c5012	We saw his anguish
c5013	when he pleaded with us,
c5014	but we would not listen.
c5015	That is why this distress has come upon us.”
c5016	But Reuben replied:
c5017	I tell
c5018	“Didn’t
c5020	you not to sin against the boy?
c5021	But you would not listen.
c5022	his blood!”
c5023	Now we must account for
c5024	They did not realize
c5025	that Joseph understood them,
c5026	since there was an interpreter between them.
c5027	And he turned away from
c5028	them and wept.
c5029	When he turned back ... to them,
c5030	and spoke
c5031	he took Simeon from them
c5032	and had him bound before their eyes.
c5033	Then Joseph gave orders
c5034	to fill their bags with grain,
c5035	return ... man’s silver
c5036	each ... to his sack,
c5037	and give them provisions for their journey.
c5038	This order was carried out,
c5039	and they loaded the grain on their donkeys
c5040	and departed.
c5041	one of them opened his sack
c5042	At the place where they lodged for the night, ... to get feed for his donkey,
c5043	and he saw his silver
c5044	in the mouth of the sack.
c5045	he said to his brothers.
c5046	“My money has been returned!”
c5047	“It is here in my sack.”
c5048	Their hearts sank,
c5049	and trembling,
c5050	they turned to one another
c5051	and said,
c5052	“What is this that God has done to us?”
c5053	When they reached their father Jacob in the land of Canaan,
c5054	they described to him all
c5055	that had happened to them:
c5057	“The man who is the lord of the land spoke harshly to us
c5059	and accused us of spying on the country.
c5060	But we told him,
c5061	‘We ... honest men,
c5062	are ... not spies.
c5063	We are twelve
c5064	brothers,
c5065	sons of one father.
c5066	One
c5067	is no more,
c5068	and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.’
c5069	Then the man who is the lord of the land said to us,
c5070	‘This is how I will know
c5071	whether you are honest:
c5072	Leave one brother with me,
c5073	take food to relieve the hunger of your households,
c5074	and go.
c5075	But bring your youngest brother back to me
c5076	so I will know
c5077	that you are not spies
c5078	but honest men.
c5079	Then I will give your brother back to you,
c5080	and you can trade in the land.’”
c5082	As they began emptying their sacks,
c5083	there in each man’s sack was his bag of silver!
c5084	And when they and their father saw the bags of money,
c5085	they were dismayed.
c5086	Their father Jacob said to them,
c5087	“You have deprived me of my sons.
c5088	Joseph
c5089	is gone
c5090	and Simeon
c5091	is no more.
c5092	Now you want to take Benjamin.
c5093	Everything is happening against me!”
c5094	Then Reuben said to his father,
c5096	“You may kill my two sons
c5097	if I fail to bring him back to you.
c5098	Put him in my care,
c5099	and I will return him.”
c5100	But Jacob replied,
c5101	“My son will not go down there with you,
c5102	for his brother is dead,
c5103	and he alone is left.
c5104	If any harm comes ... journey,
c5105	to him on your
c5106	you will bring my gray hairs down to Sheol in sorrow.”
c5107	Now the famine was still severe in the land.
c5109	So when [Jacob’s sons] had eaten all
c5110	the grain
c5111	they had brought from Egypt,
c5112	their father said to them,
c5113	“Go back
c5114	and buy a little more food for us.”
c5115	But Judah replied,
c5117	“The man solemnly warned us,
c5119	‘You will not see my face
c5120	again unless your brother is with you.’
c5121	If you will send our brother with us,
c5122	we will go down
c5123	and buy food for you.
c5124	But if you will not send him,
c5125	we will not go;
c5126	for the man told us,
c5127	‘You will not see my face
c5128	again unless your brother is with you.’”
c5129	Israel asked.
c5130	“Why did you bring this trouble upon me?”
c5131	“Why did you tell the man
c5132	you had another brother?”
c5133	They replied,
c5134	“The man questioned us in detail about ourselves and our family:
c5135	he would say,
c5136	‘Is your father still alive?
c5137	Do you have another brother?’
c5138	And we answered him accordingly.
c5139	How could we possibly know
c5140	that
c5141	‘Bring your brother here’?”
c5142	And Judah said to his father Israel,
c5143	“Send the boy with me,
c5145	and we will go at once,
c5146	so that we may live
c5147	and not die— neither we, nor you, nor our children.
c5148	I will guarantee his safety.
c5149	You may hold me personally responsible!
c5150	If I do not bring him back
c5151	and set him before you,
c5152	then let me bear the guilt before you all my life.
c5153	If we had not delayed,
c5154	we could have come and gone twice by now.”
c5155	Then their father Israel said to them,
c5156	“If it must be so,
c5157	then do this:
c5158	Put some of the best products of the land in your packs
c5159	and carry them down as a gift for the man— a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachios and almonds.
c5160	Take double the money with you
c5161	so that ... the money
c5162	you may return ... in the mouths of your sacks.
c5163	that was put back into
c5164	Perhaps it was a mistake.
c5165	Take your brother also,
c5166	at once.
c5167	and return to the man
c5168	May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man
c5169	so that he will release your other brother along with Benjamin.
c5170	As for me,
c5171	if I am bereaved,
c5172	I am bereaved.”
c5173	So the men took these gifts,
c5174	along with double the amount of money,
c5175	and Benjamin as well.
c5177	They made their way down to Egypt
c5178	and stood before Joseph.
c5179	When Joseph saw Benjamin with [his brothers],
c5180	he said
c5181	to the steward of his house,
c5182	“Take these men to my house.
c5183	Slaughter an animal
c5184	and prepare it,
c5185	for they shall dine with me at noon.”
c5186	The man did
c5187	as Joseph had commanded
c5188	and took [the brothers] to Joseph’s house.
c5189	But the men were frightened
c5190	that they had been taken to Joseph’s house.
c5191	they said.
c5192	here because of the money
c5193	that was returned in our bags the first time,”
c5194	“We have been brought
c5195	“They intend
c5196	to overpower us
c5197	and take us as slaves, along with our donkeys.”
c5198	So they approached ... steward
c5199	Joseph’s
c5200	and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.
c5201	they said,
c5202	“Please, sir,”
c5203	“we really did come down here the first time
c5204	to buy food.
c5205	But
c5206	when we came to the place we stopped for the night,
c5207	we opened our sacks
c5208	and, behold, each of us [found] his silver in the mouth of his sack!
c5209	It was the full amount of our money,
c5210	and we have brought it back with us.
c5211	We have brought additional money with
c5212	us to buy food.
c5213	We do not know
c5214	who put our money in our sacks.”
c5215	said the steward.
c5216	“It is fine,”
c5217	“Do not be afraid.
c5218	Your God, the God of your father, gave you the treasure [that was] in your sacks.
c5219	I received your money.”
c5220	Then he brought Simeon out to them.
c5221	And the [steward] took the men into Joseph’s house,
c5222	gave them water
c5223	to wash their feet,
c5224	and provided food for their donkeys.
c5225	they prepared their gift
c5226	for Joseph’s arrival at noon.
c5227	Since [the brothers] had been told
c5228	that they were going to eat a meal there,
c5229	When Joseph came home,
c5230	they presented him with the gifts
c5231	they had brought,
c5233	and they bowed to the ground before him.
c5234	He asked if they were well,
c5235	and then he asked,
c5236	“vvv How is your elderly father
c5237	that you told [me about]?
c5238	Is he still alive?”
c5239	they answered.
c5240	“Your servant our father is well,”
c5241	“He is still alive.”
c5242	And they bowed down
c5243	to honor him.
c5244	When [Joseph] looked up
c5245	and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son,
c5246	he asked,
c5247	“Is this your youngest brother,
c5248	the one you told me about?”
c5249	Then he declared,
c5250	“May God be gracious to you,
c5251	my son.”
c5252	Joseph hurried
c5253	out because he was moved ... for his brother,
c5254	to tears
c5256	and he went to a private room
c5257	to weep.
c5258	Then he washed his face
c5259	and came back out.
c5260	Regaining his composure,
c5261	he said,
c5262	“Serve the meal.”
c5263	They served [Joseph’s] brothers ... him and the Egyptians
c5264	who ate with him,
c5265	separately from
c5266	because Egyptians would not
c5267	eat with Hebrews,
c5268	since that was detestable to them.
c5269	They were seated before him
c5270	in order by age, from the firstborn
c5271	to the youngest,
c5272	and the men ... in astonishment.
c5273	looked at each other
c5274	When the portions were served to them from Joseph’s table,
c5275	Benjamin’s portion was five times larger than anyone else’s.
c5276	So they feasted
c5277	and drank freely with [Joseph].
c5278	Then Joseph instructed
c5279	his steward:
c5281	“Fill the men’s sacks with as much food
c5282	as they can
c5283	carry,
c5284	and put each one’s silver in the mouth of his bag.
c5285	Put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack,
c5286	along with the silver for his grain.”
c5287	So [the steward] did as Joseph
c5288	told him.
c5289	At daybreak,
c5290	the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.
c5291	They ... gone ... from the city
c5292	had not ... far
c5293	when Joseph told
c5294	his steward,
c5295	at once,
c5296	“Pursue the men
c5297	and when you overtake them,
c5298	ask,
c5299	‘Why have you repaid good with evil?
c5300	Is this not
c5301	the cup that my master drinks from
c5302	and uses for divination?
c5303	is wicked!’”
c5304	What you have done
c5305	When [the steward] overtook them,
c5306	he repeated these words to them.
c5307	they asked.
c5308	“Why does my lord say these things?”
c5309	“Your servants could not possibly
c5310	do such a thing.
c5311	the money
c5312	we found in the mouths of our sacks.
c5313	We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan
c5314	Why would we steal gold and silver from your master’s house?
c5315	If any of your servants is found to have it,
c5316	he must die,
c5317	and the rest will become slaves of my lord.”
c5318	replied the steward.
c5319	“vvv As you say,” ... “But only the one
c5320	who is found with [the cup]
c5321	will be my slave,
c5322	and the rest of you shall be free of blame.”
c5323	one quickly
c5324	lowered
c5325	So each ... his sack to the ground
c5326	and opened
c5327	it.
c5328	The steward searched,
c5329	beginning with the oldest
c5330	and ending with the youngest—
c5331	and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
c5332	Then they all tore their clothes,
c5333	loaded
c5334	their donkeys,
c5335	and returned to the city.
c5336	When Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph’s house,
c5337	he
c5338	was still there,
c5339	and they fell to the ground before him.
c5340	Joseph declared.
c5341	“What is this deed
c5342	you have done?”
c5343	“Did you not know
c5344	that a man ... can surely divine the truth?”
c5345	like me
c5346	can we say ... Judah
c5347	“What ... to my lord?” ... replied.
c5348	“How can we plead?
c5349	How can we justify ourselves?
c5350	God has exposed the iniquity of your servants.
c5351	We are now my lord’s slaves—
c5352	both we
c5353	and the one who was found with the cup.”
c5354	But Joseph replied,
c5355	“Far be it from me
c5356	to do this.
c5357	The man
c5358	who was found with the cup
c5359	will be my slave.
c5360	The rest of you may return to your father in peace.”
c5361	Then Judah approached [Joseph]
c5362	and said,
c5363	“Sir,
c5364	please let your servant speak personally to my lord.
c5365	Do not be angry with your servant,
c5366	for you are an equal to Pharaoh.
c5367	My lord asked his servants,
c5369	‘Do you have a father or a brother?’
c5370	And we answered,
c5371	‘We have an elderly father and a younger brother, the child of his old age.
c5372	The boy’s brother is dead.
c5373	He is the only one of his mother’s sons left,
c5374	and his father loves him.’
c5375	Then you told your servants,
c5376	‘Bring him down to me
c5377	so that I can see him for myself.’
c5378	So we said to my lord,
c5379	‘The boy cannot
c5380	leave his father.
c5381	If he were to leave, his father
c5382	would die.’
c5383	But you said to your servants,
c5384	‘vvv Unless your younger brother comes down with you,
c5385	you will not ... again.’
c5386	see my face
c5387	Now when
c5388	we returned to your servant my father,
c5389	we relayed your words to him.
c5390	Then our father said,
c5391	‘Go back
c5392	and buy us some food.’
c5393	But we answered,
c5394	‘We cannot
c5395	go down there
c5396	unless our younger brother ... with us.
c5397	goes
c5398	we cannot
c5399	see the man.’
c5400	So if our younger brother
c5401	is not with us,
c5402	And your servant my father said to us,
c5403	‘You know
c5404	that my wife bore me two sons.
c5405	When one of them left me,
c5406	I said,
c5407	“Surely he has been torn to pieces.”
c5408	And I have not seen him since.
c5409	So if you take this one from me as well
c5410	and harm comes to him,
c5411	you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.’
c5412	So
c5413	when I return to your servant, my father—
c5414	if the boy
c5415	is not with us
c5416	his life is wrapped up in the boy’s life—
c5418	when he sees
c5419	that the boy [is] not [with us],
c5420	he will die.
c5421	Then your servants will have brought the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow.
c5422	Indeed, your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father,
c5423	saying,
c5424	‘If I do not return him to you,
c5425	I will bear the guilt before you, my father, all my life.’
c5426	Now
c5427	please let your servant stay here as my lord’s slave, in place of the boy.
c5428	Let him return with his brothers.
c5429	For how can I go back to my father
c5430	the boy?
c5431	without
c5432	I could not bear to see the misery
c5433	that would overwhelm [him].”
c5434	Joseph could no longer
c5435	control himself before all
c5436	his attendants,
c5437	and he cried out,
c5438	“Send everyone away from me!”
c5439	So none [of them] were with [Joseph]
c5440	when he made himself known to his brothers.
c5441	But he wept so loudly
c5442	that the Egyptians
c5443	and Pharaoh’s household heard him.
c5444	Joseph said to his brothers,
c5445	“I am Joseph!
c5446	Is my father still alive?”
c5447	But they were unable
c5448	to answer him,
c5449	because they were terrified in his presence.
c5450	Then Joseph said to his brothers,
c5451	“Please come near me.”
c5452	And they [did so].
c5453	he said,
c5454	“I am Joseph, your brother,”
c5455	“the one you sold into Egypt!
c5456	And now,
c5457	do not be distressed
c5458	or angry with yourselves
c5459	that you sold me into this place,
c5460	because it was to save lives that God sent me before you.
c5461	For the famine has covered the land these two years,
c5462	and there will be five more years
c5463	without plowing or harvesting.
c5464	God sent me before you
c5465	to preserve you as a remnant on the earth
c5466	and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
c5467	Therefore
c5468	it was not you who sent me here,
c5469	but God,
c5470	who has made me Pharaoh's adviser— lord of all his household
c5471	and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
c5472	quickly
c5473	Now return ... to my father
c5474	and tell him,
c5475	‘This is what your son Joseph says:
c5476	God has made me lord of all Egypt.
c5477	Come down to
c5478	me without delay.
c5479	You shall settle in the land of Goshen
c5480	and be near me— you and your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and everything you own.
c5482	And there I will provide for you,
c5483	because there will be five more years of famine.
c5484	Otherwise, you and your household and everything ... will come to destitution.’
c5485	you own
c5486	Behold! You and my brother Benjamin can see
c5487	that [it is] I, [Joseph],
c5488	who am speaking with you.
c5489	Tell my father about all my splendor in Egypt and everything
c5490	you have seen.
c5491	quickly.”
c5492	And bring my father down here
c5493	Then Joseph threw his arms around his brother Benjamin
c5494	and wept,
c5495	and Benjamin wept as they embraced.
c5496	Joseph kissed each of his brothers
c5497	as he wept over them.
c5498	And afterward his brothers talked with him.
c5499	When the news reached Pharaoh’s house
c5501	that Joseph’s brothers had come,
c5502	Pharaoh and his servants were pleased.
c5503	Pharaoh said to Joseph,
c5504	“Tell your brothers,
c5505	‘Do as follows:
c5506	Load your animals
c5507	and return
c5508	to the land of Canaan.
c5509	Then bring your father and your families
c5510	and return to me.
c5511	I will give you the best of the land of Egypt,
c5512	and you shall eat from the fat of the land.’
c5513	You are also directed to tell them:
c5515	‘Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your young children and your wives,
c5516	and bring your father
c5517	and come back.
c5518	But pay no regard to your belongings,
c5519	for the best of all the land of Egypt
c5520	[will be] yours.’”
c5521	So the sons of Israel did [as they were told].
c5522	Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had instructed,
c5523	and he also gave them provisions for their journey.
c5524	He gave new garments to each of them,
c5525	but to Benjamin he gave three hundred [shekels] of silver and five sets of clothes.
c5526	And he sent to his father the following: ten donkeys
c5527	loaded with the best of Egypt,
c5528	and ten female donkeys
c5529	loaded with grain and bread and provisions for his father’s journey.
c5530	Then Joseph sent his brothers on their way,
c5531	and as they were leaving,
c5532	he said to them,
c5533	“Do not quarrel on the way!”
c5534	So [the brothers] went up out of Egypt
c5535	and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
c5536	they said,
c5538	“Joseph is still alive,”
c5539	“and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!”
c5540	But Jacob was stunned,
c5541	for he did not believe them.
c5542	However, when they relayed all ... Joseph ... them,
c5543	that ... had told
c5544	and when he saw the wagons
c5545	that Joseph had sent
c5546	to carry him back,
c5547	the spirit of their father Jacob was revived.
c5548	Then Israel declared,
c5549	“I am convinced!
c5550	My son Joseph is still alive!
c5551	I will go
c5552	to see
c5553	him before I die.”
c5554	So Israel set out with all
c5555	that he had,
c5556	and when he came to Beersheba,
c5557	he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
c5558	And that night God spoke to Israel in a vision:
c5559	He said.
c5560	“Jacob, Jacob!”
c5561	replied Jacob.
c5562	“Here I am,”
c5563	He said,
c5564	“I am God,” ... “the God of your father.
c5565	Do not be afraid
c5566	to go down to Egypt,
c5567	for I will make you into a great nation there.
c5568	I will go down with you to Egypt,
c5569	and I will surely bring you back.
c5570	And Joseph’s own hands will close your eyes.”
c5571	Then Jacob departed from Beersheba,
c5572	and the sons of Israel took their father Jacob in the wagons ... along with their children and wives.
c5573	Pharaoh had sent
c5574	to carry him,
c5575	They also took their livestock and the possessions
c5576	they had acquired in the land of Canaan,
c5577	and Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt.
c5578	He took with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons, [and] his daughters and granddaughters— all his offspring.
c5579	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel
c5580	who went to Egypt:
c5581	(Jacob and his descendants)
c5582	Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.
c5583	The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
c5584	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
c5585	The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
c5586	The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah;
c5587	but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.
c5588	The sons of Perez: Hezron and Hamul.
c5589	The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Job, and Shimron.
c5590	The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
c5591	These are the sons of Leah
c5592	born to Jacob in Paddan-aram,
c5593	in addition to his daughter Dinah.
c5594	The total number of sons and daughters [was] thirty-three.
c5595	The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
c5596	The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah.
c5597	The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
c5598	These are the sons ... to Zilpah—
c5599	whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah—
c5600	of Jacob born ... sixteen in all.
c5601	The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
c5602	were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt
c5603	by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
c5604	Manasseh and Ephraim
c5605	The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
c5606	These are the sons of Rachel
c5607	born to Jacob—
c5608	fourteen in all.
c5609	The son of Dan: Hushim.
c5610	The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
c5611	These are the sons ... to Bilhah,
c5612	whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel—
c5613	of Jacob born
c5614	seven in all.
c5615	All those ... persons.
c5616	belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt—
c5617	his direct descendants,
c5618	besides the wives of Jacob’s sons—
c5619	[numbered] sixty-six
c5620	And along with Joseph’s ... sons
c5621	who were born to him in Egypt,
c5622	two
c5623	in all ... members of Jacob’s household
c5624	there were ... in Egypt.
c5625	seventy
c5626	Now Jacob had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph
c5627	to get directions to Goshen.
c5628	When [Jacob’s family] arrived in the land of Goshen,
c5629	Joseph prepared his chariot
c5630	and went
c5631	to meet his father Israel.
c5632	[there]
c5633	Joseph presented himself to him,
c5634	embraced him,
c5635	and wept profusely.
c5636	Then Israel said to Joseph,
c5637	“Finally I can die, now
c5638	that I have seen your face
c5639	[and know] that you are still alive!”
c5640	Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household,
c5641	“I will go up
c5642	and inform Pharaoh:
c5643	to me.
c5644	‘My brothers and my father’s household
c5645	from the land of Canaan
c5646	have come
c5647	The men are shepherds;
c5648	they raise livestock,
c5649	their flocks and herds and all
c5650	that they own.’
c5651	and they have brought
c5653	When Pharaoh summons you
c5654	and asks,
c5655	‘What is your occupation?’
c5656	you are to say,
c5657	‘Your servants have raised livestock ever since our youth— both we and our fathers.’
c5658	Then you will be allowed to settle in the land of Goshen,
c5659	since all ... are detestable to the Egyptians.”
c5660	shepherds
c5661	So Joseph went
c5662	and told Pharaoh:
c5664	“My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all
c5665	they own,
c5666	have come from the land of Canaan
c5667	and are now in Goshen.”
c5668	And he chose five of his brothers
c5669	and presented them before Pharaoh.
c5670	Pharaoh asked [Joseph’s] brothers.
c5671	“What is your occupation?”
c5672	they replied,
c5673	“Your servants are shepherds,” ... “both we and our fathers.”
c5674	Then they said to Pharaoh,
c5675	to live in the land for a time,
c5676	“We have come
c5677	because there is no pasture for the flock
c5678	of your servants,
c5679	since the famine in the land of Canaan has been severe.
c5680	So now,
c5681	please allow your servants to settle in the land of Goshen.”
c5682	Pharaoh said to Joseph,
c5684	“Now that your father and brothers have come to you,
c5685	the land of Egypt
c5686	is before you;
c5687	settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land.
c5688	They may dwell in the land of Goshen.
c5689	And if you know of
c5690	any talented men among them,
c5691	put them in charge of my own livestock.”
c5693	Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob
c5694	and presented him before Pharaoh,
c5695	and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
c5696	Pharaoh asked.
c5697	“How many years have you lived?”
c5698	Jacob replied.
c5699	“My pilgrimage [has lasted] 130 years,” ... “My years
c5700	have been few and hard, ... the years
c5701	and they have not matched ... of the lives of my fathers.”
c5702	Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh
c5703	and departed from [his] presence.
c5704	So Joseph settled his father and brothers
c5705	in the land of Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses,
c5706	as Pharaoh had commanded.
c5707	Joseph also provided his father and brothers and all his father’s household with food for [their] families.
c5708	Yet there was no food throughout that region,
c5709	because the famine was so severe;
c5710	the lands of Egypt and Canaan had been exhausted by the famine.
c5711	Joseph collected all the money
c5712	to be found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan
c5713	in exchange for the grain
c5714	they were buying,
c5715	and he brought [it] into Pharaoh’s palace.
c5716	When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was gone,
c5717	all the Egyptians came to Joseph
c5718	and said,
c5719	“Give us food.
c5720	Why should we die before your eyes?
c5721	For our funds have run out!”
c5722	said Joseph.
c5723	“Then bring me your livestock,”
c5724	I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock.”
c5725	“Since the money is gone,
c5726	So they brought their livestock to Joseph,
c5727	and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, the animals of their flocks and herds, and their donkeys.
c5728	Throughout that year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock.
c5729	When that year was over,
c5730	they came to him the next year
c5731	and said,
c5732	“We cannot hide from our lord
c5733	that our money is gone
c5734	and all our livestock belongs to [you].
c5735	There is nothing left for our lord
c5736	except our bodies and our land.
c5737	Why should we perish before your eyes— we and our land as well?
c5738	Purchase us and our land in exchange for food.
c5739	Then we, along with our land, will be slaves to Pharaoh.
c5740	Give us seed
c5741	that we may live
c5742	and not die,
c5743	and that the land may not become desolate.”
c5744	So Joseph acquired for Pharaoh all the land in Egypt;
c5745	the Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields
c5746	because the famine was so severe upon them.
c5747	The land became Pharaoh’s,
c5748	the people
c5749	and Joseph reduced ... to servitude from one end of Egypt to the other.
c5750	However, he did not acquire the priests’ portion of the land,
c5751	for it had been given to them by Pharaoh. ... the rations that
c5752	They lived off
c5753	Pharaoh supplied;
c5754	so they did not sell their land.
c5755	Then Joseph said to the people,
c5756	“Now that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh this day,
c5757	here is seed for you
c5758	to sow in the land.
c5759	At harvest time, ... will be yours
c5760	you are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh,
c5761	and four-fifths ... as seed for the field and food for yourselves
c5762	and your households
c5763	and children.”
c5764	they said.
c5765	“You have saved our lives,”
c5766	“We have found favor in our lord’s eyes,
c5767	and will be Pharaoh’s servants.”
c5768	So Joseph established a law ... and it is in effect in the land of Egypt to this day.
c5769	that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh,
c5770	Only the priests’ land does not belong to Pharaoh.
c5771	Thus the Israelites settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen.
c5772	They acquired property there
c5773	and became fruitful
c5774	and increased greatly in number.
c5775	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years,
c5776	and the length of his life was 147 years.
c5777	When the time drew near for Israel
c5778	to die,
c5779	he called his son Joseph
c5780	and said,
c5781	“If I have found favor in your eyes,
c5782	put your hand under my thigh
c5783	and promise me that you will show me kindness and faithfulness.
c5784	Do not bury me in Egypt,
c5785	but when I lie down with my fathers,
c5786	carry me out of Egypt
c5787	and bury me with them.”
c5788	Joseph answered,
c5789	“I will do as you have requested.”
c5790	Jacob said.
c5791	“Swear to me,”
c5792	So Joseph swore to him,
c5793	and Israel bowed in worship at the head of his bed.
c5794	Some time later,
c5795	Joseph was told,
c5796	“Your father is ill.”
c5797	So he set out with his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
c5798	When Jacob was told,
c5800	“Your son Joseph has come to you,”
c5801	Israel rallied his strength
c5802	and sat up in bed.
c5803	Jacob said to Joseph,
c5804	“God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan,
c5805	and there He blessed me
c5806	and told me,
c5807	‘Behold, I will make you fruitful
c5808	and multiply you;
c5809	I will make you a multitude of peoples,
c5810	and will give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.’
c5811	And now
c5812	your two sons
c5813	born to you in Egypt
c5814	before I came to you [here]
c5815	[shall be reckoned as] mine;
c5816	Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon [are mine].
c5817	Any children
c5818	born ... after them
c5819	to you ... shall be yours,
c5820	and they shall be called by the names of their brothers in the territory they inherit.
c5821	Now as for me,
c5822	when I was returning from Paddan,
c5823	to my sorrow Rachel died along the way in the land of Canaan, some distance
c5824	from Ephrath.
c5825	So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath”
c5826	(that [is], Bethlehem).
c5827	When Israel saw the sons of Joseph,
c5828	he asked,
c5829	“Who are these?”
c5830	Joseph said to his father,
c5831	“They are the sons
c5832	God has given me in this [place].”
c5833	So Jacob said,
c5834	“Please bring them to me,
c5835	that I may bless [them].”
c5836	Now Israel’s eyesight was poor because of old age;
c5837	he could hardly
c5838	see.
c5839	Joseph brought [his sons] to him,
c5840	and [his father] kissed them
c5841	and embraced them.
c5842	Israel said to Joseph,
c5843	to see your face again,”
c5844	“I never expected
c5845	“but now
c5846	God has let me see your children as well.”
c5847	Then Joseph took them from his father’s knees
c5848	and bowed down with his face to the ground.
c5849	And Joseph took both
c5850	of them— with Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand,
c5851	and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand—
c5852	and brought them close to him.
c5853	But Israel stretched out his right hand
c5854	and put it on the head of Ephraim,
c5855	the younger;
c5856	he put his left on Manasseh’s head,
c5857	and crossing his hands,
c5858	although Manasseh was the firstborn.
c5859	Then he blessed Joseph
c5860	and said:
c5861	“May the God
c5862	before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,
c5863	the God
c5864	who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
c5865	the Angel
c5866	who has redeemed me from all harm—
c5867	may He bless these boys.
c5868	And may they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,
c5869	and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.”
c5870	When Joseph saw
c5871	that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head,
c5872	he was displeased
c5873	and took his father’s hand
c5874	to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s.
c5875	Joseph said.
c5876	“Not so,
c5877	my father!”
c5878	“This one is the firstborn;
c5879	put your right hand on his head.”
c5880	But his father refused.
c5881	he said.
c5882	“I know,
c5883	my son,
c5884	I know!”
c5885	“He too shall become a people,
c5886	and he too shall be great;
c5887	nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he,
c5888	and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.”
c5889	So that day [Jacob] blessed them
c5890	pronounce
c5891	shall Israel ... this blessing:
c5892	and said: “By you
c5893	‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’”
c5894	So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
c5895	Then Israel said to Joseph,
c5896	“Look, I am about to die,
c5897	but God will be with you
c5898	and bring you back to the land of your fathers.
c5899	And to you, as one who is above your brothers, I give the ridge of land
c5900	that I took from the Amorites with my sword and bow.”
c5901	Then Jacob called for his sons
c5902	and said,
c5903	“Gather around
c5904	so that I can tell
c5905	you what will happen to you in the days to come:
c5906	Come together
c5907	and listen,
c5908	O sons of Jacob;
c5909	listen to your father Israel.
c5910	Reuben,
c5911	you are my firstborn,
c5912	my might, and the beginning of my strength,
c5913	excelling in honor, excelling in power.
c5914	Uncontrolled as the waters,
c5915	you will no longer excel,
c5916	because you went up to your father’s bed,
c5917	and defiled it.
c5918	onto my couch
c5919	Simeon and Levi are brothers;
c5920	their swords are weapons of violence.
c5921	May I never enter their council;
c5922	may I never join their assembly.
c5923	For they kill men in their anger,
c5924	and hamstring oxen on a whim.
c5925	Cursed [be] their anger,
c5926	for it is strong,
c5927	and their wrath,
c5928	for it is cruel!
c5929	I will disperse them in Jacob
c5930	and scatter them in Israel.
c5931	Judah,
c5933	your brothers shall praise you.
c5934	Your hand shall be on the necks of your enemies;
c5935	your father’s sons shall bow down to you.
c5936	Judah is a young lion—
c5937	from the prey.
c5938	my son,
c5939	you return
c5940	he crouches
c5941	Like a lion ... [and] lies down; like a lioness,
c5942	who dares to rouse him?
c5943	The scepter will not depart from Judah,
c5944	nor the staff from between his feet,
c5945	until Shiloh comes
c5946	and the allegiance of the nations is his.
c5947	He ties his donkey to the vine,
c5948	his colt to the choicest branch.
c5949	He washes his garments in wine,
c5950	his robes in the blood of grapes.
c5951	His eyes are darker than wine,
c5952	and his teeth are whiter than milk.
c5953	Zebulun
c5954	shall dwell by the seashore
c5955	and become a harbor for ships;
c5956	his border shall extend to Sidon.
c5957	Issachar [is] a strong donkey,
c5958	lying down between the sheepfolds.
c5959	He saw ... his resting place
c5960	that ... was good
c5961	his land
c5962	and that ... was pleasant,
c5963	so he bent his shoulder
c5964	to the burden
c5965	and submitted to labor as a servant.
c5966	Dan shall provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
c5967	He will be a serpent by the road,
c5968	a viper in the path,
c5969	that bites the horse’s heels
c5970	so that its rider tumbles backward.
c5971	I await Your salvation,
c5972	O LORD.
c5973	Gad
c5974	will be attacked by raiders,
c5975	but he will attack their heels.
c5976	Asher’s
c5977	food will be rich;
c5978	he shall provide royal delicacies.
c5979	Naphtali is a doe set free
c5980	that bears beautiful fawns.
c5981	Joseph is a fruitful vine,
c5982	a fruitful vine by a spring,
c5983	whose branches
c5984	scale the wall.
c5985	attacked him with bitterness,
c5986	and aimed
c5987	The archers ... in hostility.
c5988	Yet he steadied his bow,
c5989	and his strong arms were tempered by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,
c5990	in the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
c5991	by the God of your father
c5992	who helps you,
c5993	and by the Almighty
c5994	who blesses you, with blessings of the heavens above, with blessings of the depths
c5995	below,
c5996	with blessings of the breasts and womb.
c5997	The blessings of your father have surpassed the blessings of the ancient mountains and the bounty of the everlasting hills.
c5998	May they rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince of his brothers.
c5999	Benjamin is a ravenous wolf;
c6001	in the morning he devours the prey,
c6002	in the evening he divides the plunder.”
c6003	These are the tribes of Israel, twelve in all,
c6004	and this
c6005	was what their father said to them.
c6006	He blessed them,
c6008	each one with a suitable blessing.
c6009	and he blessed
c6010	Then [Jacob] instructed them,
c6011	to
c6012	“I am about to be gathered ... my people. ... me with
c6013	Bury ... my fathers in the cave
c6014	in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
c6015	The cave
c6016	is in the field of Machpelah
c6017	near Mamre, in the land of Canaan.
c6018	This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.
c6019	There Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried,
c6020	there Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried,
c6021	and there I buried Leah.
c6022	The field and the cave ... were purchased
c6023	that is in it
c6024	from the Hittites.”
c6025	When Jacob had finished
c6026	instructing his sons,
c6027	he pulled his feet into the bed
c6028	and breathed his last,
c6029	and he was gathered to his people.
c6030	Then Joseph fell upon his father’s face,
c6031	wept over him,
c6032	and kissed him.
c6033	And Joseph directed the physicians in his service
c6034	to embalm his father
c6035	Israel. So they embalmed him,
c6036	taking the forty days required to complete
c6037	the embalming. ... days.
c6038	And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy
c6039	When the days of mourning had passed,
c6040	Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court,
c6042	“If I have found favor in your eyes, please
c6043	tell Pharaoh that
c6045	my father made me swear an oath
c6046	when he said,
c6047	‘I am about to die.
c6048	in the tomb
c6049	that I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.’
c6050	You must bury me
c6051	Now
c6052	let me go
c6053	and bury my father,
c6054	and then return.”
c6055	Pharaoh replied,
c6056	“Go up
c6057	and bury your father,
c6058	as he made you swear [to do].”
c6059	Then Joseph went
c6060	to bury his father,
c6061	and all the servants of Pharaoh accompanied him— the elders of Pharaoh’s household and all the elders of the land of Egypt—
c6062	along with all of Joseph’s household, and his brothers, and his father’s household.
c6063	Only their children and flocks and herds were left in Goshen.
c6064	Both chariots and horsemen went up with him,
c6065	and it was an exceedingly large procession.
c6066	When they reached the threshing floor of Atad,
c6067	which is across the Jordan,
c6068	they lamented and wailed loudly,
c6069	and Joseph mourned for his father seven days.
c6070	When the Canaanites of the land saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad,
c6071	they said,
c6072	“This is a solemn ceremony of mourning by the Egyptians.”
c6073	Thus ... is called Abel-mizraim.
c6074	the place across the Jordan
c6075	So Jacob’s sons did
c6076	as he had charged them.
c6077	They carried him to the land of Canaan
c6078	and buried him in the cave at Machpelah in the field
c6079	which Abraham had purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.
c6080	near Mamre,
c6081	Joseph ... he returned to Egypt with his brothers and all
c6082	who had gone with him
c6083	had buried his father,
c6084	After ... to bury his father.
c6085	When Joseph’s brothers saw
c6086	that their father was dead,
c6087	they said,
c6088	“What if Joseph bears a grudge?
c6089	Then he will surely repay us for all the evil
c6090	that we did to him.”
c6091	So they sent word to Joseph,
c6092	saying,
c6093	“Before he died, your father commanded,
c6095	‘This is what you are to say to Joseph:
c6096	I beg you, please forgive the transgression and sin of your brothers,
c6097	for they did you wrong.’
c6098	So now, [Joseph],
c6099	please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.”
c6100	Joseph wept.
c6101	When their message came to him,
c6102	His brothers also came to him,
c6103	bowed down before him,
c6104	and said,
c6105	“We are your slaves!”
c6106	But Joseph replied,
c6107	“Do not be afraid.
c6109	Am I in the place of God?
c6110	As for you, what you intended against me for evil,
c6111	God intended for good,
c6112	in order to accomplish a day like this—
c6113	to preserve the lives of many people.
c6114	Therefore
c6115	do not be afraid.
c6116	I will provide for you and your little ones.”
c6117	So [Joseph] reassured [his brothers]
c6118	and spoke kindly to them.
c6119	Now Joseph and his father’s household remained in Egypt,
c6120	and Joseph lived to the age of 110.
c6121	He saw Ephraim’s sons to the third generation,
c6122	and indeed the sons of Machir son of Manasseh were brought up on Joseph’s knees.
c6123	Then Joseph said to his brothers,
c6124	“I am about to die,
c6125	but God will surely visit you
c6126	and bring you up from this land to the land
c6127	He promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
c6128	And Joseph made the sons of Israel take an oath
c6129	and said,
c6130	“God will surely visit you,
c6131	and then you must carry my bones up from this place.”
c6132	So Joseph died at the age of 110.
c6133	And they embalmed [his body]
c6134	and placed it in a coffin in Egypt.
c6135	These are the names of the sons of Israel
c6136	who went to Egypt with Jacob,
c6137	each with his family:
c6138	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;
c6139	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;
c6140	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
c6141	The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all,
c6142	including Joseph, who was already in Egypt.
c6143	Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,
c6144	but the Israelites were fruitful
c6145	and increased abundantly;
c6146	they multiplied
c6147	and became exceedingly strong,
c6148	so that the land was filled with them.
c6149	Then a new king, ... came to power in Egypt.
c6150	who knew nothing of Joseph,
c6151	he said to his people,
c6152	“Look,” ... “the Israelites [have become] too numerous and too powerful for us.
c6153	Come,
c6154	we must deal shrewdly with them,
c6155	or they will increase even more;
c6156	and if
c6157	a war breaks out,
c6158	they may join our enemies,
c6159	fight against us,
c6160	and leave the country.”
c6161	So [the Egyptians] appointed taskmasters over
c6162	the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor.
c6163	As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
c6164	But the more they were oppressed,
c6165	the more they multiplied
c6166	and flourished,
c6167	so that the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.
c6168	They worked the Israelites ruthlessly
c6169	and made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields.
c6170	Every service
c6171	they imposed
c6172	was harsh.
c6173	Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives,
c6174	whose names were Shiphrah
c6175	and Puah,
c6177	“When you help the Hebrew women give birth,
c6178	observe them as they deliver.
c6179	If [the child] is a son,
c6180	kill him;
c6181	but if it is a daughter,
c6182	let her live.”
c6183	The midwives, however, feared God
c6184	and did not do
c6185	as the king of Egypt had told them;
c6186	they let the boys live.
c6187	So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives
c6188	and asked them,
c6189	“Why have you done this?
c6190	Why have you let the boys live?”
c6191	The midwives answered Pharaoh,
c6192	“The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for
c6193	they are vigorous
c6194	and give birth before ... arrives.”
c6195	a midwife
c6196	So God was good to the midwives,
c6197	and the people multiplied
c6198	and became even more numerous.
c6200	And because the midwives feared God,
c6201	He gave them families of their own.
c6202	Then Pharaoh commanded all his people:
c6204	“Every son born [to the Hebrews]
c6205	you must throw into the Nile,
c6206	but every daughter you may allow to live.”
c6207	Now a man of the house of Levi
c6208	married a Levite woman,
c6209	and she conceived
c6210	and gave birth to a son.
c6211	When she saw
c6212	that he [was a] beautiful [child],
c6213	she hid him for three months.
c6214	But when she could no longer
c6215	hide him,
c6216	she got him a papyrus basket
c6217	and coated it with tar and pitch.
c6218	Then she placed the child in [the basket]
c6219	and set it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
c6220	And his sister stood at a distance
c6221	to see
c6222	what would happen to him.
c6223	Soon the daughter of Pharaoh went down
c6224	to bathe
c6225	in the Nile,
c6226	and her attendants were walking along the riverbank.
c6227	And when she saw the basket among the reeds,
c6228	she sent her maidservant
c6229	to retrieve it.
c6230	When she opened it,
c6231	she saw the child,
c6232	and behold, the little boy was crying.
c6233	So she had compassion on him
c6234	and said,
c6235	“This is one of the Hebrew children.”
c6236	Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter,
c6237	“Shall I go
c6238	and call one of the Hebrew women to nurse
c6239	the child for you?”
c6240	Pharaoh’s daughter told her.
c6241	“Go ahead,”
c6242	And the girl went
c6243	and called the boy’s mother.
c6244	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her,
c6245	“Take this child
c6246	and nurse him for me,
c6247	and I will pay your wages.”
c6248	So the woman took the boy
c6249	and nursed him.
c6250	When the child grew older,
c6251	she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter,
c6252	and he became her son.
c6253	She named him Moses
c6254	and explained,
c6255	“I drew him out of the water.”
c6256	One day,
c6257	after Moses had grown up,
c6258	he went out to his own people
c6259	and observed their hard labor.
c6260	He saw an Egyptian
c6261	beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.
c6262	After looking all around
c6263	and seeing
c6264	no one,
c6265	he struck down the Egyptian
c6266	and hid his body in the sand.
c6267	The next day [Moses] went out
c6268	and saw
c6269	two Hebrews fighting.
c6270	He asked the one in the wrong,
c6271	“Why are you attacking your fellow [Hebrew]?”
c6272	But the man replied,
c6273	“Who made you ruler and judge over us?
c6275	to kill
c6276	Are you planning
c6277	me as you killed the Egyptian?”
c6278	Then Moses was afraid
c6279	and thought,
c6280	“This thing I have done has surely become known.”
c6281	When Pharaoh heard about this matter,
c6282	he sought
c6283	to kill Moses.
c6284	But Moses fled from Pharaoh
c6285	and settled in the land of Midian,
c6286	where he sat down beside a well.
c6287	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters,
c6288	and they came
c6289	to draw water
c6290	and fill the troughs
c6291	to water their father’s flock.
c6292	And when some shepherds came along
c6293	and drove them away,
c6294	Moses stood up
c6295	and came to their rescue
c6296	and watered their flock.
c6297	When [the daughters] returned to their father Reuel,
c6298	he asked them,
c6299	“Why ... so early
c6300	have you returned
c6301	today?”
c6302	they replied.
c6303	“An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds,”
c6304	“He even drew water
c6305	for us and watered the flock.”
c6306	[their father] asked.
c6307	“So where is he?”
c6308	“Why did you leave the man behind?
c6309	Invite him
c6310	to have something to eat.”
c6311	Moses agreed
c6312	to stay with the man,
c6313	and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.
c6314	And she gave birth to a son
c6315	whom he named Gershom,
c6316	for he said,
c6317	“I have become a stranger in a strange land.”
c6318	After a long time,
c6319	the king of Egypt died.
c6320	The Israelites groaned ... under their burden of slavery,
c6321	and cried out
c6322	and their cry for deliverance from bondage ascended to God.
c6323	So God heard their groaning,
c6324	and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
c6325	God saw the Israelites
c6326	and took notice.
c6327	Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian.
c6328	He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness
c6329	and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
c6330	There the Angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from within a bush.
c6331	Moses saw
c6333	the bush ablaze with fire,
c6335	but it was not consumed!
c6336	So Moses thought,
c6337	“I must go over
c6338	and see this marvelous sight.
c6339	Why is the bush not burning up?”
c6340	When the LORD saw
c6341	that he had gone over
c6342	to look,
c6343	God called out to him from within the bush,
c6344	I am,”
c6345	“Moses, Moses!”
c6346	he answered.
c6347	“Here
c6348	[God] said.
c6349	“Do not come any closer,”
c6350	“Take off your sandals,
c6351	for the place
c6352	where you are standing
c6353	is holy ground.”
c6354	Then He said,
c6355	“I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”
c6356	At this, Moses hid his face,
c6357	for he was afraid
c6358	to look at God.
c6359	The LORD said,
c6360	“I have indeed seen the misery of My people
c6361	in Egypt.
c6362	I have heard them crying out because of their oppressors,
c6363	and I am aware of their sufferings.
c6364	I have come down
c6365	to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians
c6366	and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey— the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
c6367	And now
c6368	the cry of the Israelites has reached Me,
c6369	and I have seen how severely
c6370	the Egyptians are oppressing them.
c6371	Therefore,
c6372	go!
c6373	I am sending you to Pharaoh
c6374	to bring My people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”
c6375	But Moses asked God, ... to
c6376	“Who am I,
c6377	that I should go ... Pharaoh
c6378	and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
c6379	[God] said,
c6380	“I will surely be with you,”
c6381	“and this will be the sign to you
c6382	that I have sent you:
c6383	When you have brought the people out of Egypt,
c6384	all of you will worship God on this mountain.”
c6385	Then Moses asked God, ... to
c6386	“Suppose I go ... the Israelites ... me to you,’
c6387	and say to them,
c6388	‘The God of your fathers has sent
c6389	and they ask me,
c6390	‘What is His name?’
c6391	What should I tell them?”
c6392	God said to Moses,
c6393	“I AM
c6394	WHO I AM.
c6395	you are to say
c6396	This is what ... to the Israelites:
c6397	‘I AM
c6398	has sent me to you.’”
c6399	God also told Moses,
c6400	“Say to the Israelites,
c6401	‘The LORD, the God of your fathers— the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob— has sent me to you.’
c6402	This is My name forever,
c6403	and this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.
c6404	Go,
c6405	assemble the elders of Israel
c6406	and say to them,
c6407	‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, ... has appeared to me
c6408	the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
c6409	and said:
c6410	I have surely attended
c6411	to you and [have seen] what has been done to you in Egypt.
c6412	And I have promised
c6413	to bring you up out of your affliction in Egypt, into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites— a land flowing with milk and honey.’
c6414	[The elders of Israel] will listen to what you say,
c6415	and you must go with [them] to the king of Egypt
c6416	and tell him,
c6417	‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us.
c6418	Now
c6419	please let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness,
c6420	so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.’
c6421	But I know
c6422	that the king of Egypt will not allow
c6423	you to go
c6424	unless a mighty hand compels him.
c6425	So I will stretch out My hand
c6426	and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders
c6427	I will perform among them.
c6428	And after that, he will release you.
c6429	And I will grant this people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians
c6431	that when you leave,
c6432	you will not go away empty-handed.
c6433	Every woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing,
c6434	and you will put them on your sons and daughters.
c6435	So you will plunder the Egyptians.”
c6436	Then Moses answered,
c6438	“What if
c6439	they refuse to believe me
c6440	or listen to my voice?
c6441	For they may say,
c6442	‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’”
c6443	And the LORD asked him,
c6444	“What is that in your hand?”
c6445	he replied.
c6446	“A staff,”
c6447	said [the Lord].
c6448	“Throw it on the ground,”
c6449	So [Moses] threw it on the ground,
c6450	and it became a snake,
c6451	and [he] ran from it.
c6452	the LORD said to Moses.
c6453	“Stretch out your hand
c6454	and grab it by the tail,”
c6455	So he reached out his hand
c6456	and caught [the snake],
c6457	and it turned back into a staff in his hand.
c6458	“This is so that they may believe
c6459	that the LORD, the God of their fathers— the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob— has appeared to you.”
c6460	Furthermore, the LORD said to [Moses],
c6461	“Put your hand inside your cloak.”
c6462	So he put his hand inside his cloak,
c6463	and when he took it out,
c6465	his hand [was] leprous, white as snow.
c6466	said [the LORD].
c6467	“Put your hand back inside your cloak,”
c6468	So [Moses] put his hand back inside his cloak,
c6469	and when he took it out,
c6471	it was restored, like the rest of his skin.
c6472	[And the LORD said,]
c6473	“If they refuse to believe you
c6474	or heed the witness of the first sign,
c6475	they may believe [that] of the second.
c6476	will become
c6477	But if they do not believe even these two signs
c6478	or listen to your voice,
c6479	take some water from the Nile
c6480	and pour it on the dry ground.
c6481	Then the water
c6482	you take from the Nile
c6483	blood on the ground.”
c6484	Moses replied,
c6485	“Please, Lord,”
c6486	“I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since
c6487	You have spoken to Your servant,
c6488	for I am slow of speech and tongue.”
c6489	And the LORD said to him,
c6490	“Who gave man his mouth?
c6491	Or who makes him mute or deaf, sighted or blind?
c6492	Is it not I, the LORD?
c6493	Now
c6494	go!
c6495	I will help you as you speak,
c6496	and I will teach
c6497	you what to say.”
c6498	But Moses replied,
c6499	“Please, Lord,
c6500	send someone else.”
c6502	Then the LORD’s anger burned against Moses,
c6503	and He said,
c6504	“Is not Aaron the Levite your brother?
c6505	I know
c6506	that he can speak well,
c6507	and ... is now
c6508	he ... on his way
c6509	to meet you.
c6510	When he sees you,
c6511	he will be glad in his heart.
c6512	You are to speak to him
c6513	and put the words in his mouth.
c6514	I will help both of you to speak,
c6515	and I will teach
c6516	you what to do.
c6517	He will speak to the people for you.
c6518	will be
c6519	He ... your spokesman,
c6520	and it will be as if you were God to him.
c6521	But take this staff in your hand
c6522	so that you can perform signs with it.”
c6523	Then Moses went
c6524	back to his father-in-law Jethro
c6525	and said to him,
c6526	“Please
c6527	let me return to my brothers
c6528	in Egypt
c6529	and see
c6530	if they are still alive.”
c6531	[Jethro] replied.
c6532	“Go in peace,”
c6533	Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian,
c6534	“Go
c6535	back to Egypt,
c6536	for all the men ... are dead.”
c6537	who sought to kill you
c6538	So Moses took his wife and sons,
c6539	put them on a donkey,
c6540	and headed back to Egypt.
c6541	And [he] took the staff of God in his hand.
c6542	The LORD instructed Moses,
c6543	“When you go
c6544	back to Egypt,
c6545	see that ... all the wonders
c6546	that I have put within your power.
c6547	you perform before Pharaoh
c6548	But I will harden his heart
c6549	so that he will not let the people go.
c6550	Then tell Pharaoh [that]
c6551	this is what the LORD says:
c6552	‘Israel is My firstborn son,
c6553	and I told you
c6554	to let My son go
c6555	so that he may worship Me.
c6556	But you have refused
c6557	to let him go,
c6558	so I will kill your firstborn son!’”
c6559	Now at a lodging place along the way,
c6560	the LORD confronted [Moses]
c6561	and was about
c6562	to kill him.
c6563	But Zipporah took a flint knife,
c6564	cut off her son’s foreskin,
c6565	and touched [Moses’] feet [with it].
c6566	she said.
c6567	“Surely you [are] a bridegroom of blood to me,”
c6568	So [the LORD] let him alone.
c6569	(When she said,
c6570	“bridegroom of blood,”
c6571	she was referring to the circumcision.)
c6572	Meanwhile, the LORD had said to Aaron,
c6573	“Go
c6574	and meet Moses in the wilderness.”
c6575	So he went
c6576	and met [Moses] at the mountain of God
c6577	and kissed him.
c6578	And Moses told Aaron everything the LORD
c6579	had sent
c6580	him to say, and all the signs
c6581	He had commanded him to perform.
c6582	Then Moses and Aaron went
c6583	and assembled all the elders of the Israelites,
c6584	and Aaron relayed everything
c6585	that the LORD had said to Moses.
c6586	And [Moses] performed the signs before the people,
c6587	and [they] believed.
c6588	And when they heard
c6589	that the LORD had attended to the Israelites
c6590	and had seen their affliction,
c6591	they bowed down
c6592	and worshiped.
c6593	Afterward, Moses and Aaron went
c6594	to Pharaoh and said,
c6595	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c6596	‘Let My people go,
c6597	so that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.’”
c6598	But Pharaoh replied,
c6599	“Who is the LORD
c6600	that I should obey His voice
c6601	[and] let Israel go?
c6602	I do not know the LORD,
c6603	and I will not let Israel go.”
c6604	they answered.
c6605	“The God of the Hebrews has met with us,”
c6606	“Please let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness
c6607	to sacrifice to the LORD our God,
c6608	or He may strike us with plagues or with the sword.”
c6609	But the king of Egypt said to them,
c6610	why
c6611	“Moses and Aaron,
c6612	do you draw the people away from their work?
c6613	Get back to your work!”
c6614	Pharaoh also said,
c6615	“Look, the people of the land are now numerous,
c6616	and you would be stopping them from their labor.”
c6617	That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen:
c6619	“You shall no longer
c6620	supply the people with straw
c6621	for making bricks.
c6623	They must go
c6624	and gather their own straw.
c6625	the same quota of bricks
c6626	as before;
c6627	But require of them
c6628	do not reduce it.
c6629	For they are lazy;
c6630	that is why they are crying out,
c6632	‘Let us go
c6633	and sacrifice to our God.’
c6634	Make the work harder on the men
c6635	so they will be occupied
c6636	and pay no attention to [these] lies.”
c6637	So the taskmasters and foremen of the people went out
c6638	and said to them,
c6639	says:
c6640	“This is what Pharaoh
c6641	‘I am no longer giving you straw.
c6642	Go
c6643	and get your own straw
c6644	wherever you can find it;
c6645	but your workload will in no way be reduced.’”
c6646	So the people scattered all over the land of Egypt
c6647	to gather stubble for straw.
c6648	The taskmasters kept pressing them,
c6649	saying,
c6650	“Fulfill your quota each day,
c6651	just as you did when straw was provided.”
c6652	Then the Israelite foremen, ... were beaten
c6653	whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over the people,
c6654	and asked,
c6655	“Why have you not fulfilled your quota
c6656	of bricks yesterday
c6657	or today, as you did before?”
c6658	So the Israelite foremen went
c6659	and appealed to Pharaoh:
c6661	“Why are you treating your servants this way?
c6662	No straw has been given to your servants,
c6663	bricks!’
c6664	yet we are told,
c6665	‘Make
c6666	Look, your servants are being beaten,
c6667	but the fault [is] with your own people.”
c6668	Pharaoh replied.
c6669	“You are slackers,”
c6670	“Slackers!
c6671	That is why you keep saying,
c6672	‘Let us go
c6673	and sacrifice to the LORD.’
c6674	Now
c6675	get to
c6676	work.
c6677	You will be given no straw,
c6678	yet you must deliver the full quota of bricks.”
c6679	The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble
c6680	when they were told,
c6681	“You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks.”
c6682	they confronted Moses and Aaron,
c6683	who stood
c6684	waiting to meet them.
c6685	When they left Pharaoh,
c6686	[the foremen] said,
c6687	“May the LORD look upon you
c6688	and judge you,”
c6689	“for you have made us a stench before Pharaoh and his officials;
c6690	you have placed in their hand a sword
c6691	to kill us!”
c6692	So Moses returned to the LORD
c6693	and asked,
c6694	“Lord,
c6695	why have You brought trouble upon this people?
c6696	Is this why You sent me?
c6697	Ever since I went to Pharaoh
c6698	to speak in Your name,
c6699	he has brought trouble on this people,
c6700	and You have not delivered Your people in any way.”
c6701	But the LORD said to Moses,
c6702	“Now you will see
c6703	what I will do to Pharaoh,
c6704	for because of My mighty hand he will let them go;
c6705	because of My strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”
c6706	God also told Moses,
c6708	“I am the LORD.
c6709	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty,
c6710	by My name, ‘the LORD.’
c6711	but I did not reveal Myself to them
c6712	I also established My covenant with
c6713	them to give them the land of Canaan, the land where
c6714	they lived as foreigners.
c6715	Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites,
c6716	whom the Egyptians are enslaving,
c6717	and I have remembered My covenant.
c6718	Therefore
c6719	tell the Israelites:
c6720	‘I am the LORD,
c6721	and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians
c6722	and deliver you from their bondage.
c6723	I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.
c6724	I will take you as My own people,
c6725	and I will be your God.
c6726	Then you will know
c6727	that I am the LORD your God,
c6728	who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
c6729	And I will bring you into the land
c6730	that I swore
c6731	to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
c6732	I will give it to you as a possession.
c6733	I am the LORD!’”
c6734	Moses relayed this [message] to the Israelites,
c6735	but on account of their broken spirit and cruel bondage, they did not listen to [him].
c6736	So the LORD said to Moses,
c6738	“Go
c6739	and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt
c6740	to let the Israelites go out of his land.”
c6741	But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied,
c6743	“If
c6744	the Israelites will not listen to me,
c6745	then how will Pharaoh listen to me,
c6746	since I am unskilled in speech?”
c6747	Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron ... concerning
c6748	and gave them a charge ... both the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c6749	to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.
c6750	These were the heads of their fathers’ houses:
c6751	The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, [were] Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.
c6752	These were the clans of Reuben.
c6753	The sons of Simeon [were] Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
c6754	These were the clans of Simeon.
c6755	These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records:
c6756	Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
c6757	Levi lived 137 years.
c6758	The sons of Gershon [were] Libni and Shimei, by their clans.
c6759	The sons of Kohath [were] Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
c6760	Kohath lived 133 years.
c6761	The sons of Merari [were] Mahli and Mushi.
c6762	These were the clans of the Levites according to their records.
c6763	And Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed,
c6764	and she bore him Aaron and Moses.
c6765	Amram lived 137 years.
c6766	The sons of Izhar [were] Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
c6767	The sons of Uzziel [were] Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
c6768	And Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon.
c6769	She bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
c6770	The sons of Korah [were] Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph.
c6771	These were the clans of the Korahites.
c6772	Aaron’s son Eleazar married [one] of the daughters of Putiel,
c6773	and she bore him Phinehas.
c6774	These were the heads of the Levite families by their clans.
c6775	It was this Aaron and Moses
c6776	to whom the LORD said,
c6777	“Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions.”
c6779	were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt
c6780	in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
c6781	Moses and Aaron
c6782	Now on the day
c6783	the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,
c6784	He said to him,
c6786	“I am the LORD;
c6787	tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything
c6788	that I say to you.”
c6789	But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied,
c6790	“Since I am unskilled in speech,
c6791	why would Pharaoh listen to me?”
c6792	The LORD answered Moses,
c6793	“See,
c6794	I have made you like God to Pharaoh,
c6795	and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
c6796	You are to speak all
c6797	that I command you,
c6798	and your brother Aaron must declare it to Pharaoh
c6799	so that he will let the Israelites go out of his land.
c6800	But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart,
c6801	and though I will multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
c6802	Pharaoh will not listen to you.
c6803	Then I will lay My hand on Egypt,
c6804	and by mighty acts of judgment I will bring the divisions of My people the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.
c6805	And the Egyptians will know
c6806	that I am the LORD,
c6807	when I stretch out My hand against Egypt
c6808	and bring the Israelites out from among them.”
c6809	So Moses and Aaron did
c6810	just as the LORD had commanded them.
c6812	Moses was eighty years old
c6813	and Aaron was eighty-three
c6814	when they spoke to Pharaoh.
c6815	The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c6817	“When Pharaoh tells you,
c6819	‘Perform a miracle,’
c6820	you are to say to Aaron,
c6821	‘Take your staff
c6822	and throw it down before Pharaoh,’
c6823	[and] it {will} become a serpent.”
c6824	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh
c6825	and did
c6826	just as the LORD had commanded.
c6827	Aaron threw his staff {down} before Pharaoh and his officials,
c6828	and it became a serpent.
c6829	But Pharaoh called the wise men and sorcerers ... also
c6830	and magicians of Egypt, and they ... did the same things by their magic arts.
c6831	one threw down
c6832	Each ... his staff,
c6833	and it became a serpent.
c6834	But Aaron’s staff swallowed up [the other] staffs.
c6835	Still, Pharaoh’s heart was hardened,
c6836	and he did not listen to them,
c6837	just as the LORD had said.
c6838	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c6839	“Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn;
c6840	he refuses
c6841	to let the people go.
c6842	Go to Pharaoh in the morning
c6843	as you see him walking out to the water.
c6844	Wait
c6845	to meet him,
c6846	on the bank of the Nile
c6847	the staff
c6848	that was changed into a snake.
c6849	and take in your hand
c6850	Then say to him,
c6851	‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent
c6852	me to tell you:
c6853	Let My people go,
c6854	so that they may worship Me in the wilderness.
c6855	But
c6856	you have not listened until now.
c6857	This is what the LORD says:
c6858	By this you will know
c6859	that I am the LORD.
c6860	Behold,
c6861	with the staff ... I will strike
c6862	in my hand
c6863	the water
c6864	of the Nile,
c6865	and it will turn to blood.
c6866	The fish
c6867	in the Nile
c6868	will die,
c6869	the river will stink,
c6870	and the Egyptians will be unable
c6871	to drink its water.’”
c6872	And the LORD said to Moses,
c6873	“Tell Aaron,
c6874	‘Take your staff
c6875	and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt— over their rivers [and] canals and ponds and reservoirs—
c6876	that they may become blood.’
c6877	There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in the vessels of wood and stone.”
c6878	Moses and Aaron did
c6879	just as the LORD had commanded;
c6880	he raised the staff
c6881	and struck the water
c6882	in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials, ... of the Nile,
c6883	and all the water was turned
c6885	to blood.
c6886	The fish
c6887	in the Nile
c6888	died,
c6889	and the river smelled so bad
c6890	could not
c6891	drink its water.
c6892	that the Egyptians ... There was blood throughout the land of Egypt.
c6893	But the magicians of Egypt did the same things by their magic arts.
c6894	So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened,
c6895	and he would not listen to [Moses and Aaron],
c6896	just as the LORD had said.
c6897	Instead, Pharaoh turned around,
c6898	went into his palace,
c6899	and did not take even this to heart.
c6900	So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water
c6901	to drink,
c6902	because they could not
c6903	drink the water from the river.
c6904	And seven full days passed
c6905	after the LORD had struck the Nile.
c6906	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c6907	“Go to Pharaoh
c6908	and tell him that
c6909	this is what the LORD says:
c6910	‘Let My people go,
c6911	so that they may worship Me.
c6912	But if you refuse
c6913	to let them go,
c6914	I will plague your whole country with frogs.
c6915	The Nile will teem with frogs,
c6916	and they will come
c6917	into your palace and up to your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and your people, and into your ovens and kneading bowls.
c6918	The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’”
c6919	And the LORD said to Moses,
c6920	“Tell Aaron,
c6921	‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers and canals and ponds, ... onto
c6922	and cause the frogs to come up ... the land of Egypt.’”
c6923	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt,
c6924	and the frogs came up
c6925	and covered the land of Egypt.
c6926	But the magicians did the same thing by their magic arts,
c6927	and they also brought frogs up onto the land of Egypt.
c6928	Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron
c6929	and said,
c6930	“Pray to the LORD
c6931	to take the frogs away from me and my people.
c6932	Then I will let your people go,
c6933	that they may sacrifice to the LORD.”
c6934	Moses said to Pharaoh,
c6935	“You may have the honor over me.
c6936	When shall I pray for you and your officials and your people
c6937	that the frogs ... may be taken away from you and your houses?”
c6938	(except for those in the Nile)
c6939	[Pharaoh] answered.
c6940	“Tomorrow,”
c6941	Moses replied,
c6942	“It will be as you say,”
c6943	“so that you may know
c6944	that there is no one like the LORD our God.
c6945	The frogs will depart from you and your houses and your officials and your people;
c6946	they will remain only in the Nile.”
c6947	After Moses and Aaron had left Pharaoh,
c6948	Moses cried out to the LORD for help with the frogs
c6949	that He had brought against Pharaoh.
c6950	And the LORD did as Moses requested,
c6951	and the frogs in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields died.
c6952	The people piled them into countless heaps,
c6953	and there was a terrible stench in the land.
c6954	When Pharaoh saw
c6955	there was relief, however,
c6956	he hardened his heart
c6957	and would not listen to [Moses and Aaron],
c6958	just as the LORD had said.
c6959	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c6960	“Tell Aaron,
c6961	‘Stretch out your staff
c6962	and strike the dust of the earth,
c6963	that it may turn into swarms of gnats throughout the land of Egypt.’”
c6964	This they did,
c6965	and when Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff
c6966	and struck the dust of the earth,
c6967	gnats came upon man and beast.
c6968	All the dust of the earth turned into gnats throughout the land of Egypt.
c6969	The magicians tried ... using their magic arts,
c6970	to produce gnats
c6971	but they could not.
c6972	And the gnats remained on man and beast.
c6973	the magicians said to Pharaoh.
c6974	“This is the finger of God,”
c6975	But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened,
c6976	and he would not listen to them,
c6977	just as the LORD had said.
c6978	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c6979	“Get up early in the morning,
c6980	and when Pharaoh ... stand before him
c6981	goes out to the water,
c6982	and tell him that
c6983	this is what the LORD says:
c6984	‘Let My people go,
c6985	so that they may worship Me.
c6986	But
c6987	if you will not let My people go,
c6988	I will send swarms of flies upon you and your officials and your people and your houses.
c6989	The houses of the Egyptians ... will be full of flies.
c6990	and even the ground
c6991	where they [stand]
c6992	But on that day I will give special treatment to the land of Goshen,
c6993	where My people live;
c6994	no swarms [of flies] will be [found] there.
c6995	In this way you will know
c6996	that I, the LORD, am in the land.
c6997	I will make a distinction between My people and your people.
c6998	This sign will take place tomorrow.’”
c6999	And the LORD did so.
c7000	Thick swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials. Throughout Egypt the land
c7001	was ruined by swarms of flies.
c7002	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses
c7003	and Aaron
c7004	and said,
c7005	“Go,
c7006	sacrifice to your God within this land.”
c7007	But Moses replied,
c7008	“It would not be right
c7009	to do that,
c7010	because ... would be detestable to the Egyptians.
c7011	the sacrifices we offer to the LORD our God
c7012	If we offer sacrifices that are detestable before the Egyptians,
c7013	will they not stone us?
c7014	We must make a three-day journey into the wilderness
c7015	and sacrifice to the LORD our God
c7016	as He commands us.”
c7017	Pharaoh answered,
c7018	“I will let you go
c7019	and sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness,
c7020	but you must not ... very far.
c7021	go
c7022	Now pray for me.”
c7023	Moses said,
c7024	“As soon as I leave you,”
c7025	“I will pray to the LORD,
c7026	so that tomorrow the swarms of flies will depart from Pharaoh and his officials and his people.
c7027	But Pharaoh must not ... again
c7028	act deceitfully
c7029	by refusing to let the people go
c7030	and sacrifice to the LORD.”
c7031	Then Moses left Pharaoh
c7032	and prayed to the LORD,
c7033	and the LORD did as Moses requested.
c7034	He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh and his officials and his people;
c7035	not one [fly] remained.
c7036	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time as well,
c7037	and he would not let the people go.
c7038	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7039	“Go to Pharaoh
c7040	and tell him that
c7041	this is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says:
c7042	‘Let My people go,
c7043	so that they may worship Me.
c7044	But
c7045	if you refuse
c7046	to let them go
c7047	and continue to restrain them,
c7048	then the hand of the LORD will bring ... on your livestock
c7049	in the field—
c7050	on your horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks.
c7051	a severe plague
c7052	But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt,
c7053	so that no [animal] belonging to the Israelites will die.’”
c7054	The LORD set a time,
c7055	saying,
c7056	“Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land.”
c7057	And the next day the LORD did just that.
c7058	All the livestock of the Egyptians died,
c7059	but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.
c7060	So Pharaoh sent officials,
c7061	who saw that
c7062	none of the livestock of the Israelites had died.
c7063	But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened,
c7064	and he would not let the people go.
c7065	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c7066	“Take handfuls of soot from the furnace;
c7067	in the sight of Pharaoh, Moses is to toss it into the air.
c7068	It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt,
c7069	and ... boils ... on man and beast
c7070	festering ... will break out
c7071	throughout the land.”
c7072	So they took soot from the furnace
c7073	and stood before Pharaoh.
c7074	Moses tossed it into the air,
c7075	and ... boils
c7076	festering ... broke out on man and beast.
c7077	The magicians could not
c7078	stand before Moses,
c7079	because the boils
c7080	had broken out on [them] and on all the Egyptians.
c7081	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart,
c7082	and he would not listen to them,
c7083	just as the LORD had told Moses.
c7084	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7085	“Get up early in the morning,
c7086	stand before Pharaoh,
c7087	and tell him that
c7088	this is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says:
c7089	‘Let My people go,
c7090	so that they may worship Me.
c7091	Otherwise, I will send all My plagues against you
c7092	and your officials and your people,
c7093	so you may know
c7094	that [there is] no one like Me in all the earth.
c7095	For by this time I could have stretched out My hand
c7096	and struck you and your people with a plague
c7097	to wipe you off the earth.
c7098	But
c7099	I have raised you up for this very purpose,
c7100	that I might display to you My power,
c7101	and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
c7102	Still, you lord it over My people
c7103	and do not allow them to go.
c7104	Behold, at this time tomorrow I will rain down the worst hail
c7105	that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day
c7106	it was founded
c7107	until now.
c7108	So
c7109	give orders {now}
c7110	to shelter your livestock and everything
c7111	you have in the field.
c7112	Every man or beast
c7113	that remains in the field
c7114	and is not brought inside
c7115	when the hail comes down upon them.’”
c7116	will die
c7117	who feared the word of the LORD
c7118	Those among Pharaoh’s officials
c7119	hurried to bring their servants and livestock to shelter,
c7120	but those who disregarded the word of the LORD
c7121	left their servants and livestock in the field.
c7122	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7123	“Stretch out your hand toward heaven,
c7124	so that hail may fall on all the land of Egypt— on man and beast and every plant of the field throughout the land of Egypt.”
c7125	So Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven,
c7126	and the LORD sent thunder and hail,
c7127	and lightning struck the earth.
c7128	So the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
c7129	The hail fell
c7130	and the lightning continued flashing through it. The hail
c7131	was so severe
c7132	that nothing like it had ever been [seen] in all the land of Egypt
c7133	from the time it became a nation.
c7134	Throughout the land of Egypt, the hail struck down everything
c7135	in the field,
c7136	both man and beast;
c7137	[it] beat down every plant of the field
c7138	and stripped every tree.
c7139	The only ... in the land of Goshen,
c7140	where the Israelites [lived].
c7141	place where it did not hail was
c7142	Then Pharaoh summoned
c7143	Moses and Aaron.
c7144	he said.
c7145	“This time I have sinned,”
c7146	“The LORD [is] righteous,
c7147	and I and my people [are] wicked.
c7148	Pray to the LORD,
c7149	enough
c7150	for there has been ... of God’s thunder and hail.
c7151	I will let you go;
c7152	you do not ... any longer.”
c7153	need to stay
c7154	Moses said to him,
c7155	“When I have left the city,
c7156	I will spread out my hands to the LORD.
c7157	The thunder will cease,
c7158	and there will be no more hail,
c7159	so that you may know
c7160	that the earth [is] the LORD’s.
c7161	But as for you and your officials,
c7162	I know
c7163	that you still do not fear the LORD our God.”
c7164	(Now the flax and barley were destroyed,
c7165	since the barley
c7166	was ripe and the flax [was] in bloom;
c7167	but the wheat and the spelt were not destroyed,
c7168	because they are late crops.)
c7169	Then Moses departed from Pharaoh, [went] out of the city,
c7170	and spread out his hands to the LORD.
c7171	The thunder and hail ceased,
c7172	and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
c7173	When Pharaoh saw
c7174	that the rain and hail and thunder had ceased,
c7175	again
c7176	he sinned
c7177	and hardened his heart— he and his officials.
c7178	So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened,
c7179	and he would not let the Israelites go,
c7180	just as the LORD had said through Moses.
c7181	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7182	“Go to Pharaoh,
c7183	for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials,
c7184	that I may perform these miraculous signs of Mine among them,
c7185	and that you may tell your children and grandchildren
c7186	how severely I dealt with the Egyptians
c7187	miraculous signs
c7188	when I performed ... among them,
c7189	so that you may know
c7190	that I am the LORD.”
c7191	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh
c7192	and told him,
c7193	“This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says:
c7194	‘How long will you refuse
c7195	to humble yourself before Me?
c7196	Let My people go,
c7197	so that they may worship Me.
c7198	But
c7199	if you refuse
c7200	to let My people go,
c7201	I will bring locusts into your territory tomorrow.
c7202	They will cover the face of the land
c7203	so that no one can
c7204	see [it].
c7205	They will devour whatever is ... after
c7206	left ... the hail
c7207	and eat every tree
c7208	that grows in your fields.
c7209	They will fill your houses and the houses of all your officials and every Egyptian—
c7210	something neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since the day
c7211	they came into this land.’”
c7213	Then [Moses] turned
c7214	and left Pharaoh’s presence.
c7215	Pharaoh’s officials asked him,
c7216	“How long will this man be a snare to us?
c7217	Let the people go,
c7218	so that they may worship the LORD their God.
c7219	Do you not yet realize
c7220	that Egypt is in ruins?”
c7221	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh.
c7222	[he] said.
c7223	“Go,
c7224	worship the LORD your God,”
c7225	“But who exactly
c7226	will be going?”
c7227	Moses replied.
c7228	“We will go with our young and old,”
c7229	“We will go with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds,
c7230	for [we must hold] a feast to the LORD.”
c7231	Then [Pharaoh] told them,
c7232	“May the LORD be with you
c7233	if I ever let you go with your little ones.
c7234	Clearly
c7235	you are bent on evil.
c7236	No,
c7237	may go
c7238	only the men
c7239	and worship the LORD,
c7240	since that is what you have been requesting.”
c7241	And [Moses and Aaron] were driven from Pharaoh’s presence.
c7242	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7243	“Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt, that the locusts
c7244	may swarm over it
c7245	and devour every plant in the land— everything
c7246	that the hail has left behind.”
c7247	So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt,
c7248	and throughout that day and night the LORD sent an east wind across the land.
c7249	By morning
c7250	the east wind had brought the locusts.
c7251	The locusts swarmed across the land
c7252	and settled over the entire territory of Egypt.
c7253	many
c7254	Never before had there been so ... locusts,
c7255	and never again will there be.
c7256	They covered the face of all the land
c7257	until [it] was black,
c7258	and they consumed all the plants on the ground and all the fruit on the trees
c7259	that the hail had left behind.
c7260	Nothing green was left on any tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
c7261	Pharaoh quickly
c7262	summoned Moses and Aaron
c7263	and said,
c7264	“I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
c7265	Now
c7266	please forgive my sin once more
c7267	and appeal to the LORD your God,
c7268	so that He will remove this death from me.”
c7269	So Moses left Pharaoh’s
c7270	presence and appealed to the LORD.
c7271	And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind
c7272	that carried off the locusts
c7273	and blew them into the Red Sea.
c7274	Not a single locust remained anywhere in Egypt.
c7275	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart,
c7276	and he would not let the Israelites go.
c7277	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7278	“Stretch out your hand toward heaven,
c7279	so that darkness will spread over the land of Egypt—
c7280	a palpable darkness.”
c7281	So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven,
c7282	and total darkness covered all the land of Egypt for three days.
c7283	No ... could see
c7284	one ... each other,
c7285	no one left
c7286	his place.
c7287	and for three days
c7288	Yet all the Israelites had light in their dwellings.
c7289	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses
c7290	and said,
c7291	“Go,
c7292	worship the LORD.
c7293	only your flocks and herds must stay behind.”
c7294	Even your little ones may go with you;
c7295	But Moses replied,
c7296	“You must also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings
c7297	to present to the LORD our God.
c7298	Even our livestock must go with us;
c7299	not a hoof will be left behind,
c7300	for we will need some of
c7301	them to worship the LORD our God,
c7302	and we will not know
c7303	how we are to worship the LORD
c7304	until we arrive.”
c7305	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart,
c7306	and he was not willing
c7307	to let them go.
c7308	Pharaoh said to [Moses].
c7309	“Depart from me!”
c7310	“Make sure
c7311	you never ... again,
c7312	see my face
c7313	for on the day
c7314	you see my face,
c7315	you will die.”
c7316	Moses replied,
c7317	“As you say,”
c7318	“I will never ... again.”
c7319	see your face
c7320	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7321	“I will bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt one more plague.
c7322	After that, he will allow you to leave this place.
c7323	And when he lets you go, ... completely.
c7324	he will drive you out
c7325	Now announce to the people
c7326	for
c7327	that men
c7328	and women alike should ask their neighbors
c7329	articles of silver and gold.”
c7330	And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight
c7331	of the Egyptians. Moreover, Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people.
c7332	So Moses declared,
c7333	“This is what the LORD says:
c7334	‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt,
c7335	and every firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die,
c7336	from the firstborn of Pharaoh
c7337	who sits on his throne,
c7338	to the firstborn of the servant girl
c7339	behind the hand mill,
c7340	as well as the firstborn of all the cattle.
c7341	Then a great cry will go out over all the land of Egypt,
c7342	such as never has been heard before,
c7343	[and never] will be [heard] again.
c7344	But among all the Israelites, not even a dog will snarl at man or beast.’
c7345	Then you will know
c7346	that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
c7347	All these officials of yours will come
c7348	and bow before me,
c7349	saying,
c7350	‘Go, you and all the people
c7351	who follow you!’
c7352	After that, I will depart.”
c7353	And hot with anger, [Moses] left Pharaoh’s presence.
c7354	The LORD said to Moses,
c7355	“Pharaoh will not listen to you,
c7356	so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”
c7357	Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh,
c7358	but the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart
c7359	so that he would not let the Israelites go out of his land.
c7360	Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
c7362	“This month is the beginning of months for you;
c7363	it [shall be] the first month of your year.
c7364	Tell the whole congregation of Israel
c7366	that on the tenth day of this month,
c7367	must select
c7368	each man ... a lamb for his family,
c7369	one per household.
c7370	If the household ... small
c7371	for a whole lamb,
c7372	they are to share with ... neighbor,
c7373	the nearest
c7374	based on the number of people,
c7375	is too ... accordingly.
c7376	and apportion the lamb
c7377	Your lamb must be an unblemished year-old male,
c7378	[and] you may take it from the sheep or the goats.
c7379	You must care for it until the fourteenth day of the month,
c7380	when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel will slaughter [the animals] at twilight.
c7381	They are to take some of the blood
c7382	and put it on the two sideposts and tops of the doorframes of the houses
c7383	in which they eat [the lambs].
c7384	They are to eat the meat that night, roasted over the fire,
c7385	along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
c7386	Do not eat any of [the meat] raw ... in boiling
c7387	or cooked ... water,
c7388	but only roasted over the fire— its head and legs and inner parts.
c7389	Do not leave any of it until morning;
c7391	before the morning ... any part that is left over.
c7392	you must burn up
c7393	This is how you are to eat it:
c7394	You must be fully dressed for travel,
c7395	with your sandals on your feet
c7396	and your staff in your hand.
c7397	You are to eat in haste;
c7398	it is the LORD’s Passover.
c7399	On that night I will pass through the land of Egypt
c7400	and strike down every firstborn male, both man and beast,
c7401	and I will execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt.
c7402	I am the LORD.
c7403	The blood on the houses ... will distinguish them;
c7404	where you are staying
c7405	when I see the blood,
c7406	I will pass over you.
c7407	No plague will fall on you to destroy you
c7408	when I strike the land of Egypt.
c7409	And this day will be a memorial for you,
c7410	and you are to celebrate it as a feast to the LORD, ... for the generations to come.
c7411	as a lasting ordinance
c7412	For seven days you must eat unleavened bread.
c7413	On the first day you are to remove the yeast from your houses.
c7414	Whoever
c7415	eats anything leavened
c7416	from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.
c7417	On the first day ... a sacred assembly,
c7418	you are to hold ... and another on the seventh day.
c7419	You must not do any work
c7420	on those days, except to prepare the meals—
c7421	that is all you may do.
c7422	So you are to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
c7423	for on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land of Egypt.
c7424	You must observe this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
c7425	In the first [month] you are to eat unleavened bread, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.
c7426	For seven days there must be no yeast found in your houses.
c7427	If anyone
c7428	eats something leavened,
c7429	that person, whether a foreigner or native of the land, must be cut off from the congregation of Israel.
c7430	{You are} not to eat anything leavened;
c7431	eat unleavened bread in all your homes.”
c7432	Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel
c7433	and told them,
c7434	“Go at once
c7435	and select for yourselves a lamb for each family,
c7436	and slaughter the Passover lamb.
c7437	Take a cluster of hyssop,
c7438	dip it into the blood
c7439	in the basin,
c7440	and brush the top and the two sideposts of the doorframe with some of the blood.
c7442	None of you shall go out
c7443	the door of his house
c7444	until morning.
c7445	When the LORD passes through
c7446	to strike down the Egyptians,
c7447	He will see the blood on the top and the two sideposts ... over
c7448	and pass ... the door;
c7449	so He will not allow the destroyer
c7450	to enter your houses
c7451	and strike you down.
c7452	And you are to keep this command as a perpetual ordinance for you and your descendants.
c7454	When you enter the land
c7455	that the LORD will give you
c7456	as He promised,
c7457	you are to observe this service.
c7459	When your children ask you,
c7460	‘What does this service mean to you?’
c7461	you are to reply,
c7462	‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD,
c7463	who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt
c7464	when He struck down
c7465	the Egyptians and spared our homes.’”
c7466	Then the people bowed down
c7467	and worshiped.
c7468	went
c7469	And the Israelites ... and did
c7470	just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
c7472	Now at midnight
c7473	the LORD struck down every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh,
c7474	who sat on his throne,
c7475	to the firstborn of the prisoner
c7476	in the dungeon,
c7477	as well as all the firstborn among the livestock.
c7478	During the night Pharaoh got up— he and all his officials and all
c7479	the Egyptians— and there was loud wailing
c7480	in Egypt; for there was no house
c7481	without someone dead.
c7482	Then [Pharaoh] summoned Moses and Aaron by night
c7483	and said,
c7484	“Get up,
c7485	leave my people,
c7486	both you and the Israelites!
c7487	Go,
c7488	worship the LORD
c7489	as you have requested.
c7490	Take your flocks and herds as well,
c7491	just as you have said,
c7492	and depart!
c7493	And bless me also.”
c7494	the Egyptians urged the people on.
c7495	quickly,
c7496	And in order to send them out of the land
c7497	“For [otherwise],” they said,
c7498	“we are all going to die!”
c7499	So the people took their dough
c7500	before it was leavened,
c7501	[carrying it] on their shoulders in kneading bowls wrapped in clothing.
c7502	Furthermore, the Israelites acted on Moses’ word
c7503	and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, and for clothing.
c7504	And the LORD gave the people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians
c7505	that they granted their request.
c7506	In this way they plundered the Egyptians.
c7507	The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth
c7508	with about 600,000 ... on foot,
c7509	men ... besides women and children.
c7510	And a mixed multitude also went up with them, along with great droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.
c7511	their dough ... the people baked
c7512	what they had brought out of Egypt
c7513	into unleavened loaves.
c7514	Since ... had no yeast,
c7515	For when they had been driven out of Egypt,
c7516	they could not
c7517	delay
c7518	and had not prepared any provisions for themselves.
c7519	Now the duration of the Israelites’
c7520	stay in Egypt
c7521	was 430 years.
c7522	At the end of the 430 years,
c7523	to the very day,
c7524	all the LORD’s divisions went out of the land of Egypt.
c7525	Because the LORD kept a vigil that night
c7526	to bring them out of Egypt,
c7527	this same night [is to be a vigil] to the LORD, to be observed by all the Israelites for the generations to come.
c7528	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c7529	“This is the ordinance of the Passover:
c7530	No foreigner is to eat of it.
c7531	But any slave [who] has been purchased
c7532	after you have circumcised him.
c7533	may eat of it,
c7534	A temporary resident or hired hand shall not eat the Passover.
c7535	It must be eaten inside one house.
c7536	You are not to take any of the meat outside the house,
c7537	and you may not break any of the bones.
c7538	The whole congregation of Israel must celebrate it.
c7539	If a foreigner resides with
c7540	you and wants to celebrate the LORD’s Passover,
c7541	all the males [in the household] must be circumcised;
c7542	then he may come near
c7543	to celebrate it,
c7544	and he shall be like a native of the land.
c7545	But no uncircumcised man may eat of it.
c7546	The same law shall apply to both the native and the foreigner
c7547	who resides among you.”
c7548	Then all the Israelites did
c7549	just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
c7550	this— they did
c7551	And on that very day
c7552	the LORD brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions.
c7553	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7555	“Consecrate to Me every firstborn male.
c7556	The firstborn from every womb among the Israelites ... [both] of man and beast.”
c7557	belongs to Me,
c7558	So Moses told the people,
c7559	“Remember this day,
c7560	[the day] you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery;
c7561	for the LORD brought you out of it by the strength of His hand.
c7562	And nothing leavened shall be eaten.
c7563	Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.
c7564	And
c7565	when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites—
c7566	[the land] He swore to your fathers
c7567	that He would give you,
c7568	a land flowing with milk and honey—
c7569	you shall keep this service in this month.
c7570	For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread,
c7571	and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.
c7572	Unleavened bread shall be eaten during those seven days.
c7573	Nothing leavened may be found among you,
c7574	nor shall yeast be found anywhere within your borders.
c7575	And on that day you are to explain to your son,
c7577	‘This is because of what the LORD did for me
c7578	when I came out of Egypt.’
c7579	It shall be a sign for you on your hand and a reminder on your forehead
c7580	that the law of the LORD is to be on your lips.
c7581	For with a mighty hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt.
c7582	Therefore you shall keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.
c7583	And
c7584	after the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites
c7585	as He swore to you and your fathers,
c7586	and gives it to you,
c7587	you are to present to the LORD the firstborn male of every womb.
c7588	All the firstborn ... livestock
c7589	of your
c7590	males ... [belong to] the LORD.
c7591	You must redeem every firstborn donkey with a lamb,
c7592	and if you do not redeem it,
c7593	you are to break its neck.
c7594	And every firstborn of your sons you must redeem.
c7596	In the future, when your son asks you,
c7597	mean?’
c7598	‘What does this
c7599	you are to tell him,
c7600	‘With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
c7601	And
c7602	when Pharaoh stubbornly refused
c7603	to let us go,
c7604	the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both of man and beast.
c7605	This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the firstborn male of every womb,
c7606	but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons.’
c7607	So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead,
c7608	for with a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.”
c7610	When Pharaoh let the people go,
c7611	God did not lead them along the road through the land of the Philistines,
c7612	though it was shorter.
c7613	For God said,
c7614	[they] might change their minds
c7615	“If [the people] face war,
c7616	and return to Egypt.”
c7617	So God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea.
c7618	And the Israelites left the land of Egypt arrayed for battle.
c7619	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him
c7620	because {Joseph had made} the sons of Israel swear a solemn oath
c7621	when he said,
c7622	“God will surely attend to you,
c7623	and you shall carry my bones with you from this place.”
c7624	They set out from Succoth
c7625	and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
c7626	And the LORD went before them
c7627	in a pillar of cloud ... by day,
c7628	to guide their way
c7629	and in a pillar of fire ... at night,
c7630	to give them light
c7631	so that they could travel by day or night.
c7632	Neither the pillar of cloud by day ... left
c7633	nor the pillar of fire by night ... its place before the people.
c7634	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7636	“Tell the Israelites to
c7637	turn back
c7638	and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. ... directly opposite Baal-zephon.
c7639	You are to encamp by the sea,
c7640	For Pharaoh will say of the Israelites,
c7641	‘They are wandering the land in confusion;
c7642	the wilderness has boxed them in.’
c7643	And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart
c7644	so that he will pursue them.
c7645	But I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army,
c7646	and the Egyptians will know
c7647	that I am the LORD.”
c7648	So this is what the Israelites did.
c7649	When the king of Egypt was told
c7650	that the people had fled,
c7651	Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about [them]
c7652	and said,
c7653	“What have we done?
c7654	We have released Israel
c7655	from serving us.”
c7656	So [Pharaoh] prepared his chariot
c7657	and took his army with him.
c7658	He took 600 of the best chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt,
c7659	with officers over all of them.
c7660	And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt
c7661	so that he pursued the Israelites,
c7662	who were marching out with fists raised [in defiance].
c7663	The Egyptians— ... pursued and
c7664	overtook [the Israelites]
c7665	as they camped by the sea
c7666	all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen and troops— ... near Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon.
c7667	As Pharaoh approached,
c7668	the Israelites looked up
c7669	and saw
c7670	the Egyptians marching after them,
c7671	were terrified
c7672	and [they] ... and cried out to the LORD.
c7673	They said to Moses,
c7674	“Was it because there are no graves in Egypt
c7675	that you brought us
c7676	into the wilderness to die?
c7677	What have you done to us
c7678	by bringing us out of Egypt?
c7679	{Did we} not
c7680	say to you in Egypt,
c7682	‘Leave us alone
c7683	so that we may serve the Egyptians’?
c7684	For it would have been better for us
c7685	to serve the Egyptians
c7686	than to die in the wilderness.”
c7687	But Moses told the people,
c7688	“Do not be afraid.
c7689	Stand firm
c7690	and you will see the LORD’s salvation,
c7691	which He will accomplish for you today;
c7692	for
c7693	the Egyptians you see today,
c7694	you will never ... again.
c7695	see
c7697	The LORD will fight for you;
c7698	you need only to be still.”
c7699	The LORD said to Moses,
c7700	“Why are you crying out to Me?
c7701	Tell the Israelites
c7702	to go forward.
c7703	And as for you, lift up your staff
c7704	and stretch out your hand over the sea
c7705	and divide it,
c7706	so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
c7707	And I
c7708	will harden the hearts of the Egyptians
c7709	so that they will go in after them.
c7710	Then I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army and chariots and horsemen.
c7711	The Egyptians will know
c7712	that I am the LORD
c7713	when I am honored through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”
c7714	Then the Angel of God, ... withdrew
c7715	who had gone before the camp of Israel,
c7716	and went behind them.
c7717	The pillar of cloud also moved from before them
c7718	and stood behind them,
c7719	so that it came between the camps of Egypt and Israel.
c7720	The cloud was there in the darkness,
c7721	but it lit up the night.
c7722	So all night long neither [camp] went near the other.
c7723	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,
c7724	and all that night the LORD drove back the sea with a strong east wind
c7725	that turned [it] into dry land.
c7726	So the waters were divided,
c7727	and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground,
c7728	with walls of water on their right and on their left.
c7729	Then the Egyptians chased after them—
c7730	all Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen— and followed them into the sea.
c7731	At morning watch, however,
c7732	the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud,
c7733	and He threw their camp into confusion.
c7734	He caused their chariot wheels to wobble,
c7735	so that they had difficulty driving.
c7736	said the Egyptians,
c7737	“Let us flee from the Israelites,”
c7738	“for the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt!”
c7739	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7740	“Stretch out your hand over the sea,
c7741	so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians [and] their chariots and horsemen.”
c7742	So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,
c7743	the sea returned
c7744	and at daybreak ... to its normal state.
c7745	While the Egyptians were retreating,
c7747	the LORD swept them into the sea.
c7748	The waters flowed back
c7749	and covered the chariots and horsemen— the entire army of Pharaoh
c7750	that had chased [the Israelites] into the sea.
c7751	Not one of them survived.
c7752	But the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground,
c7753	with walls of water on their right and on their left.
c7754	That day the LORD saved Israel from the hand of the Egyptians,
c7755	and Israel saw the Egyptians
c7756	dead on the shore.
c7757	When Israel saw the great power
c7758	that the LORD had exercised over the Egyptians,
c7759	the people feared the LORD
c7760	and believed in Him and in His servant Moses.
c7761	Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD:
c7764	“I will sing to the LORD,
c7765	for He is highly exalted.
c7766	The horse and rider He has thrown into the sea.
c7767	The LORD is my strength and my song,
c7768	and He has become my salvation.
c7769	He [is] my God,
c7770	and I will praise Him,
c7771	my father’s God,
c7772	and I will exalt Him.
c7773	The LORD is a warrior,
c7774	the LORD is His name.
c7775	Pharaoh’s chariots and army He has thrown into the sea;
c7776	the finest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
c7777	The depths have covered them;
c7778	they sank [there] like a stone.
c7779	Your right hand,
c7780	O LORD,
c7781	is majestic in power;
c7782	Your right hand,
c7783	O LORD,
c7784	has shattered the enemy.
c7785	You overthrew Your adversaries by Your great majesty.
c7786	You unleashed Your burning wrath;
c7787	it consumed them like stubble.
c7788	At the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up;
c7789	like a wall the currents stood firm;
c7790	the depths congealed in the heart of the sea.
c7791	The enemy declared,
c7792	‘I will pursue,
c7793	I will overtake.
c7794	I will divide the spoils;
c7795	I will gorge myself on them.
c7796	I will draw my sword;
c7797	my hand will destroy them.’
c7798	But You blew with Your breath,
c7799	and the sea covered them.
c7800	They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
c7801	Who among the gods is like You,
c7802	O LORD?
c7803	Who is like You—
c7804	majestic in holiness,
c7805	revered with praises,
c7806	performing wonders?
c7807	You stretched out Your right hand,
c7808	and the earth swallowed them up.
c7809	With loving devotion You will lead the people
c7810	You have redeemed;
c7811	with Your strength You will guide them to Your holy dwelling.
c7812	The nations will hear
c7813	[and] tremble;
c7814	anguish will grip the dwellers of Philistia.
c7815	Then the chiefs of Edom will be dismayed;
c7816	the leaders of Moab;
c7817	trembling will seize
c7818	those who dwell in Canaan will melt away,
c7819	and terror and dread will fall on them.
c7820	By the power of Your arm they will be as still as a stone
c7821	until Your people pass by,
c7822	O LORD,
c7823	until the people ... pass by.
c7824	You bought
c7825	You will bring them in
c7826	and plant them on the mountain of Your inheritance—
c7827	the place,
c7828	You have prepared for Your dwelling,
c7829	O LORD,
c7830	the sanctuary,
c7831	O Lord,
c7832	Your hands have established.
c7833	The LORD will reign forever and ever!”
c7834	For when Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen went into the sea,
c7835	the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them.
c7836	But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
c7837	Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand,
c7838	and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing.
c7839	And Miriam sang back to them:
c7840	“Sing to the LORD,
c7841	for He is highly exalted;
c7842	the horse and rider He has thrown into the sea.”
c7843	Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea,
c7844	and they went out into the Desert of Shur.
c7845	For three days they walked in the desert
c7846	without finding water.
c7847	And when they came to Marah,
c7848	they could not
c7849	drink the water [there]
c7850	because it was bitter.
c7851	(That is why it was named Marah.)
c7852	So the people grumbled against Moses,
c7853	saying,
c7854	“What are we to drink?”
c7855	And [Moses] cried out to the LORD,
c7856	and the LORD showed him a log.
c7857	And when he cast it into the waters,
c7858	[they] were sweetened.
c7859	There [the LORD] made for them a statute and an ordinance,
c7860	and there He tested them,
c7861	saying,
c7862	“If you will listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God,
c7864	what is right in His eyes,
c7865	and do
c7866	and pay attention to His commands,
c7867	and keep all His statutes,
c7868	any of the diseases
c7869	bring ... on the Egyptians.
c7870	[then] I will not ... on you ... I inflicted
c7871	For I am the LORD who heals you.”
c7872	Then they came to Elim,
c7873	where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees,
c7874	and they camped there by the waters.
c7875	set out from Elim
c7876	the whole congregation of Israel ... and came to the Desert of Sin,
c7877	which is between Elim and Sinai.
c7878	On the fifteenth day of the second month
c7879	after they had left the land of Egypt,
c7880	And [there] in the desert [they all] grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
c7881	[they said].
c7882	“If only
c7883	we had died by the LORD’s hand in the land of Egypt!”
c7884	“There we sat by pots of meat
c7885	and ate our fill of bread,
c7886	but you have brought us into this desert
c7887	to starve this whole assembly to death!”
c7888	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7889	“Behold, I will rain down bread from heaven for you.
c7890	the people are to go out
c7891	Each day ... and gather enough for that day.
c7892	In this way I will test
c7893	they will follow My instructions.
c7894	whether or not
c7895	Then on the sixth day,
c7896	when they prepare
c7897	what they bring in,
c7898	it will be twice
c7899	as much as they gather on the other days.”
c7900	So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites,
c7901	“This evening
c7902	you will know
c7903	it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
c7904	and in the morning
c7905	you will see the LORD’s glory,
c7906	because He has heard your grumbling against Him.
c7908	For who
c7909	are we that you should grumble against us?”
c7910	And Moses added,
c7911	“The LORD will give you meat ... this evening
c7912	to eat
c7913	and bread ... in the morning,
c7914	to fill you
c7915	for He has heard your grumbling
c7916	against Him. ... Your grumblings
c7917	are we?
c7918	Who
c7919	are not against
c7920	us but against the LORD.”
c7921	Then Moses said to Aaron,
c7922	“Tell the whole congregation of Israel,
c7923	‘Come before the LORD,
c7924	for He has heard your grumbling.’”
c7925	And as soon
c7926	as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of Israel,
c7927	they looked toward the desert,
c7928	and there
c7929	in a cloud the glory of the LORD appeared.
c7930	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c7932	“I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites.
c7933	Tell them,
c7935	‘At twilight you will eat meat,
c7936	and in the morning you {will} be filled with bread.
c7937	Then you will know
c7938	that I am the LORD your God.’”
c7939	That evening ... there was
c7940	quail came
c7941	and covered the camp,
c7942	and in the morning ... a layer of dew around the camp.
c7943	When the layer of dew had evaporated,
c7944	there
c7945	were thin flakes on the desert floor,
c7946	as fine as frost on the ground.
c7947	When the Israelites saw it,
c7948	they asked
c7949	one another,
c7950	“What is it?”
c7951	For they did not know
c7952	what it was.
c7953	So Moses told them,
c7954	“It is the bread
c7955	the LORD has given you to eat.
c7956	This
c7957	is what the LORD has commanded:
c7958	is to gather as much
c7959	‘Each one ... as he needs.
c7960	an omer for each person
c7962	in your tent.’”
c7963	You may take
c7964	So the Israelites did this.
c7965	Some gathered
c7966	more,
c7967	and some less.
c7968	When they measured it by the omer,
c7969	had no excess,
c7970	he who gathered much
c7972	and he who gathered little
c7973	had no shortfall.
c7974	Each one ... as much as he needed to eat.
c7975	gathered
c7976	Then Moses said to them,
c7977	one
c7978	“No ... may keep any of it until morning.”
c7979	But they did not listen to Moses;
c7980	some people left part of it until morning,
c7981	and it became full of maggots
c7982	and began to smell.
c7983	So Moses was angry with them.
c7984	Each morning they each gathered
c7985	as much as they needed,
c7986	and when the sun grew hot,
c7987	it melted away.
c7989	On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much food— two omers per person—
c7990	and all the leaders of the congregation came
c7991	and reported this to Moses.
c7992	He told them,
c7993	“This
c7994	is what the LORD has said:
c7995	‘Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD.
c7996	So bake what
c7997	you want to bake,
c7999	and boil what
c8000	you want to boil.
c8001	Then set aside whatever remains and keep it until morning.’”
c8002	So they set it aside until morning
c8003	as Moses had commanded,
c8004	and it did not smell
c8005	[or] contain any maggots.
c8006	Moses said,
c8007	“Eat it today,”
c8008	“because today is a Sabbath to the LORD.
c8009	Today you will not find anything in the field.
c8010	For six days you may gather,
c8011	but on the seventh day, the Sabbath,
c8012	it will not be [there].”
c8013	Yet
c8014	on the seventh day some of the people went out
c8015	to gather,
c8016	but they did not find anything.
c8017	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c8018	“How long will you refuse
c8019	to keep My commandments and instructions?
c8020	Understand
c8021	that the LORD has given you the Sabbath;
c8022	therefore on the sixth day He will give you bread for two days.
c8023	must stay
c8024	everyone ... where he is;
c8025	On the seventh day, ... no one may leave his place.”
c8026	So the people rested on the seventh day.
c8027	Now the house of Israel called the bread manna.
c8028	It was white like coriander seed
c8029	and tasted like wafers made with honey.
c8030	Moses said,
c8031	“This
c8032	is what the LORD has commanded:
c8033	‘Keep an omer of [manna] for the generations to come,
c8034	so that they may see the bread
c8035	I fed you in the wilderness
c8036	when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”
c8037	So Moses told Aaron,
c8038	“Take a jar
c8039	and fill it with an omer of manna.
c8040	Then place it before the LORD to be preserved for the generations to come.”
c8041	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c8042	So Aaron placed it before the Testimony to be preserved,
c8043	The Israelites ate manna forty years,
c8044	until they came to a land where they could settle;
c8045	they ate manna
c8046	until they reached the border of Canaan.
c8047	(Now an omer
c8048	is a tenth of an ephah.)
c8049	Then the entire congregation of Israel left the Desert of Sin, moving from place to place as the LORD commanded.
c8050	They camped at Rephidim,
c8051	but there was no water
c8052	for the people to drink.
c8053	So the people contended with Moses,
c8054	replied.
c8055	“Give us water
c8056	to drink.”
c8057	Moses
c8058	“Why do you contend with me?”
c8059	“Why do you test the LORD?”
c8060	But the people thirsted for water there,
c8061	and they grumbled against Moses:
c8063	“Why have you brought us out of Egypt—
c8064	to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?”
c8065	Then Moses cried out to the LORD,
c8067	“What should I do with these people?
c8068	A little more
c8069	and they will stone me!”
c8070	The LORD answered Moses,
c8071	“Walk on ahead of the people
c8072	and take some of the elders of Israel with you.
c8073	the staff
c8074	with which you struck the Nile,
c8075	Take along in your hand
c8076	and go.
c8077	Behold, I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb;
c8078	when you strike the rock,
c8079	water will come out of it
c8080	for the people to drink.”
c8081	So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.
c8082	He named the place Massah and Meribah
c8083	because the Israelites quarreled,
c8084	and because they tested the LORD,
c8085	saying,
c8086	“Is the LORD among us
c8087	or not?”
c8088	After this, the Amalekites came
c8089	and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
c8090	So Moses said to Joshua,
c8091	“Choose some of our men
c8092	and go out
c8093	to fight the Amalekites.
c8094	Tomorrow I will stand on the hilltop
c8095	with the staff of God in my hand.”
c8096	Joshua did
c8097	as Moses had instructed him
c8098	and fought against the Amalekites,
c8099	while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
c8101	As long as Moses held up his hands,
c8102	Israel prevailed;
c8104	but when he lowered [them],
c8105	Amalek prevailed.
c8106	When Moses’ hands grew heavy,
c8107	they took a stone
c8108	and put it under him,
c8109	and he sat on it.
c8110	Then Aaron and Hur held his hands up,
c8111	one on each
c8112	side,
c8113	so that his hands remained steady
c8114	until the sun went down.
c8115	So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his army with the sword.
c8116	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c8117	“Write this on a scroll as a reminder
c8118	and recite it to Joshua,
c8119	because I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.”
c8120	And Moses built an altar
c8121	and named it
c8122	The LORD Is My Banner.
c8123	he said,
c8124	“Indeed,” ... “a hand was lifted up toward the throne of the LORD.
c8125	The LORD will war against Amalek from generation to generation.”
c8126	Now Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about all
c8127	that God had done for Moses and His people Israel,
c8128	and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
c8129	After Moses had sent back his wife Zipporah, [his] father-in-law Jethro had taken her in,
c8130	along with her two sons.
c8131	One [son] was named Gershom,
c8132	for Moses had said,
c8133	“I have been a foreigner in a foreign land.”
c8134	The other [son] was named Eliezer,
c8135	because [Moses had said],
c8136	“The God of my father was my helper
c8137	and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.”
c8138	Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, along with Moses’ wife and sons, came to him in the desert,
c8139	where he was encamped at the mountain of God.
c8140	He sent word to Moses,
c8141	“I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to
c8142	you with your wife
c8143	and her two sons.”
c8144	So Moses went out to meet
c8145	his father-in-law
c8146	and bowed down
c8147	and kissed him.
c8148	They greeted
c8149	each other
c8151	and went into the tent.
c8152	Then Moses recounted to his father-in-law all
c8153	that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake,
c8154	all the hardships
c8155	they had encountered along the way,
c8156	and how the LORD had delivered them.
c8157	And Jethro rejoiced over all the good things
c8158	the LORD had done for Israel,
c8159	whom He had rescued from the hand of the Egyptians.
c8160	Jethro declared,
c8161	“Praise the LORD,
c8162	who has delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh,
c8163	and who has rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians.
c8164	Now I know
c8165	that the LORD is greater than all other gods,
c8166	for He did this
c8167	when they treated Israel arrogantly.”
c8168	Then Moses’ father-in-law Jethro brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God,
c8169	and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel
c8170	to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.
c8171	The next day
c8172	Moses took his seat
c8173	to judge the people,
c8174	and they stood around [him] from morning until evening.
c8175	When [his] father-in-law saw all
c8176	that [Moses] was doing for the people,
c8177	he asked,
c8178	“What is this
c8179	that you are doing for the people?
c8180	Why do you sit alone [as judge],
c8181	with all the people standing around you from morning till evening?”
c8182	Moses replied.
c8183	“Because the people come to
c8184	me to inquire of God,”
c8185	“Whenever they have a dispute,
c8186	it is brought to me
c8187	to judge between one man and another,
c8188	and I make known to them the statutes and laws of God.”
c8189	But Moses’ father-in-law said to him,
c8190	“What ... is not good.
c8191	you are doing
c8192	Surely you and these people ... will wear yourselves out,
c8193	with you
c8194	because the task is too heavy for you.
c8195	You cannot
c8196	handle it alone.
c8197	Now
c8198	listen to me;
c8199	I will give you some advice,
c8200	and may God be with you.
c8201	You must be the people’s representative before God
c8202	and bring their causes to Him.
c8203	Teach them the statutes and laws,
c8204	and show them the way
c8205	to live
c8206	and the work
c8207	they must do.
c8208	Furthermore, select capable men from among the people— God-fearing, trustworthy men who are averse to dishonest gain.
c8209	Appoint them over [the people] as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
c8210	Have [these men] judge the people at all times.
c8211	Then
c8212	they can bring you any major issue,
c8213	but all minor cases they can judge on their own,
c8214	so that your load may be lightened
c8215	as they share it with you.
c8216	If you follow this advice
c8217	and God so directs you,
c8218	you will be able
c8219	to endure,
c8220	and all these people can go home in peace.”
c8221	Moses listened to his father-in-law
c8222	and did everything
c8223	he said.
c8224	So Moses chose capable men from all Israel
c8225	and made them heads over the people as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
c8226	And they judged the people at all times;
c8227	they would bring the difficult cases to Moses,
c8228	but any minor issue they would judge themselves.
c8229	Then Moses sent his father-in-law {on his way},
c8230	and [Jethro] returned to his own land.
c8231	In the third month,
c8232	that the Israelites had left Egypt,
c8233	on the same day [of the month] ... they came to the Desert of Sinai.
c8234	After they had set out from Rephidim,
c8235	they entered the Desert of Sinai,
c8237	and Israel camped there in front of the mountain.
c8238	Then Moses went up to God,
c8239	and the LORD called to him from the mountain,
c8240	you are to tell
c8241	“This is what ... the house of Jacob
c8242	and explain to the sons of Israel:
c8243	‘You have seen for yourselves
c8244	what I did to Egypt,
c8245	and how I carried you on eagles’ wings
c8246	and brought you to Myself.
c8247	Now
c8248	if you will indeed obey My voice
c8249	and keep My covenant,
c8250	you will be My treasured possession out of all the nations—
c8251	for the whole earth is Mine.
c8252	And unto Me you shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’
c8253	These are the words
c8254	that you are to speak to the Israelites.”
c8255	So Moses went back
c8256	and summoned the elders of the people
c8257	and set before them all these words
c8258	that the LORD had commanded him.
c8259	And all the people answered together,
c8261	everything
c8262	that the LORD has spoken.”
c8263	“We will do
c8264	So Moses [brought] [their] words back to the LORD.
c8265	The LORD said to Moses,
c8266	“Behold, I will come to you in a dense cloud,
c8267	so that the people will hear
c8268	when I speak with you,
c8269	and they will always put their trust in you.”
c8270	And Moses relayed the words of the people to the LORD.
c8271	Then the LORD said to Moses, ... to
c8272	“Go ... the people
c8273	and consecrate them today and tomorrow.
c8274	They must wash their clothes
c8275	and be prepared by the third day,
c8276	for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
c8277	And you are to set up a boundary for the people around [the mountain]
c8278	and tell them,
c8279	‘Be careful
c8280	not to go up on the mountain
c8281	or touch its base.
c8282	Whoever
c8283	touches the mountain
c8284	shall surely be put to death.
c8285	No hand shall touch him,
c8286	but he shall surely be stoned
c8287	or shot with arrows—
c8288	whether ... beast,
c8289	man or
c8290	he must not live.’
c8291	Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast
c8292	may they go up the mountain.”
c8293	When Moses came down from the mountain to the people,
c8294	he consecrated them,
c8295	and they washed their clothes.
c8296	he said to the people.
c8297	“Be prepared for the third day,”
c8298	“Do not draw near to a woman.”
c8299	On the third day, ... came,
c8300	when morning ... there was
c8302	thunder and lightning. A thick cloud was upon the mountain,
c8303	with a very loud trumpet blast,
c8304	so that all the people ... trembled.
c8305	in the camp
c8306	Then Moses brought the people out
c8307	to meet with God,
c8308	of the camp
c8309	and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
c8310	Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke,
c8311	because the LORD had descended on it in fire.
c8312	And smoke rose like the smoke of a furnace,
c8313	and the whole mountain quaked violently.
c8314	And as
c8315	the sound of the trumpet grew louder
c8316	and louder,
c8317	Moses spoke,
c8318	and God answered him in the thunder.
c8319	The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai
c8320	[and] called Moses to the summit.
c8321	So [Moses] went up,
c8322	and the LORD said to [him],
c8323	“Go down
c8324	and warn the people
c8325	not to break through ... the LORD,
c8326	to see
c8327	[lest] many of them perish.
c8328	Even the priests
c8329	who come near the LORD
c8330	must consecrate themselves,
c8331	or the LORD will break out against them.”
c8332	But Moses said to the LORD,
c8333	“The people cannot
c8334	come up Mount Sinai,
c8335	for You solemnly warned us,
c8337	‘Put a boundary around the mountain
c8338	and set it apart as holy.’”
c8339	And the LORD replied,
c8340	“Go
c8341	down
c8342	and bring Aaron with you.
c8343	But the priests and the people must not break through
c8344	to come up to the LORD,
c8345	or He will break out against them.”
c8346	So Moses went down to the people
c8347	and spoke to them.
c8348	And God spoke all these words:
c8350	“I am the LORD your God,
c8351	who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
c8352	You shall have no other gods before Me.
c8353	{You shall} not make for yourself an idol of any kind, or an image
c8354	of anything in the heavens above,
c8355	the earth below,
c8356	or the waters under the earth.
c8357	You shall not bow down to them
c8358	or worship them;
c8359	for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God,
c8360	visiting the iniquity of the fathers on [their] children
c8361	to the third and fourth [generations] of those who hate Me,
c8362	but showing loving devotion to a thousand [generations] of those who love Me and keep My commandments.
c8363	You {shall} not take the name of the LORD your God in vain,
c8364	for the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished
c8365	who takes His name in vain.
c8366	Remember the Sabbath day
c8367	by keeping it holy.
c8368	Six days you shall labor
c8369	and do all your work,
c8370	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God,
c8371	on which you must not do any work— neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant or livestock, nor the foreigner
c8372	within your gates.
c8373	For [in] six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all
c8374	that [is] in them,
c8375	but on the seventh day He rested.
c8376	Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day
c8377	and set it apart as holy.
c8378	Honor your father and mother,
c8379	so that your days may be long in the land
c8380	the LORD your God is giving you.
c8381	You shall not murder.
c8382	You shall not commit adultery.
c8383	You shall not steal.
c8384	You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
c8385	You shall not covet your neighbor’s house.
c8386	You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his manservant or maidservant, or his ox or donkey, or anything
c8387	that belongs to your neighbor.
c8388	All the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain
c8389	in smoke.
c8390	And when the people saw [this],
c8391	they trembled
c8392	and stood at a distance.
c8393	they said to Moses.
c8394	“Speak to us yourself
c8395	and we will listen,”
c8396	“But do not let God speak to us,
c8397	or we will die.”
c8398	Moses replied.
c8399	“Do not be afraid,”
c8400	“For
c8401	to test you,
c8402	God has come
c8403	so that the fear of Him may be before you,
c8404	to keep you from sinning.”
c8405	And the people stood at a distance
c8406	as Moses approached the thick darkness
c8407	where God was.
c8408	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c8409	“This is what you are to tell the Israelites:
c8410	‘You have seen for yourselves
c8411	that I have spoken to you from heaven.
c8412	You are not to make any gods to rival Me; ... of silver
c8413	you are not to make for yourselves gods ... or gold.
c8414	You are to make for Me an altar of earth,
c8415	and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and peace offerings, your sheep and goats and cattle.
c8416	In every place
c8417	where I cause My name to be remembered,
c8418	I will come to you
c8419	and bless you.
c8420	Now if you make an altar of stones for Me,
c8421	you must not build it with stones shaped by tools;
c8422	for if you use a chisel on it,
c8423	you will defile it.
c8424	And you must not go up to My altar on steps, ... on it.’
c8425	lest your nakedness be exposed
c8426	These are the ordinances
c8427	that you are to set before them:
c8428	If you buy a Hebrew servant,
c8429	he is to serve you for six years.
c8430	But in the seventh [year], he shall go free without paying anything.
c8431	If he arrived alone,
c8432	he is to leave alone;
c8433	if he arrived with a wife,
c8434	[she] is to leave with him.
c8435	If his master gives him a wife
c8436	and she bears him sons or daughters,
c8437	the woman and her children shall belong to her master,
c8438	and [only] the man shall go free.
c8439	But if the servant declares,
c8440	‘I love my master and my wife and children;
c8441	I do not want to go free,’
c8442	then his master is to bring him before the judges.
c8443	And he shall take him to the door or doorpost
c8444	and pierce his ear with an awl.
c8445	Then he shall serve his master for life.
c8446	And if a man sells his daughter as a servant,
c8447	she is not to go free
c8448	as the menservants do.
c8449	If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master
c8450	who had designated her for himself, ... He has no
c8451	he must allow her to be redeemed.
c8452	right ... her to foreigners,
c8453	to sell
c8454	since he has broken faith with her.
c8455	And if he chooses her for his son,
c8456	he must deal with her as with a daughter.
c8457	If he takes another wife,
c8458	he must not reduce the food, clothing, or marital rights [of his first wife].
c8459	If, however, he does not provide her these three things,
c8460	she is free to go
c8461	without monetary payment.
c8462	Whoever strikes ... a man
c8463	and kills
c8464	must surely be put to death.
c8465	But if he did not lie in wait,
c8466	but God allowed it to happen,
c8467	then I will appoint for you a place
c8468	where he may flee.
c8469	But if a man ... and acts willfully against his neighbor
c8470	schemes ... to kill him,
c8471	you must take him away from My altar
c8472	to be put to death.
c8473	He who strikes his father or mother
c8474	must surely be put to death.
c8475	Whoever kidnaps another man
c8476	whether he sells him
c8477	or the man is found in his possession.
c8478	must be put to death,
c8479	Whoever curses his father or mother
c8480	must surely be put to death.
c8481	If men are quarreling
c8482	and one strikes the other with a stone or a fist,
c8483	and he does not die
c8484	but is confined to bed,
c8485	as long as the other can get up
c8486	and walk around outside with his staff.
c8487	shall go unpunished,
c8488	then the one who struck him
c8489	Nevertheless, he must compensate the man for his lost work
c8490	and see that he is completely healed.
c8491	If a man strikes his male or female servant with a rod,
c8492	and the servant dies by his hand,
c8493	he shall surely be punished.
c8494	However, if the slave gets up after a day or two,
c8495	the owner shall not be punished,
c8496	since [the slave is] his property.
c8497	If men who are fighting
c8498	strike a pregnant woman
c8499	and her child is born prematurely,
c8500	but there is no [further] injury,
c8501	he shall surely be fined
c8502	as the woman’s husband demands
c8503	and as the court allows.
c8504	But if a serious injury results,
c8505	then you must require a life for a life—
c8506	eye for eye,
c8507	tooth for tooth,
c8508	hand for hand,
c8509	foot for foot,
c8510	burn for burn,
c8511	wound for wound,
c8512	[and] stripe for stripe.
c8513	If a man strikes the eye of his manservant or maidservant ... the eye.
c8514	and blinds it,
c8515	he must let the servant go free in compensation for
c8516	And if he knocks out the tooth of his manservant or maidservant, ... the tooth.
c8517	he must let the servant go free in compensation for
c8518	If an ox gores a man or woman
c8519	to death,
c8520	the ox must surely be stoned,
c8521	and its meat must not be eaten.
c8522	But the owner of the ox shall not be held responsible.
c8523	But if the ox has a reputation for goring,
c8524	and its owner has been warned
c8525	yet does not restrain it,
c8526	and it kills a man or woman,
c8527	them the ox must be stoned
c8528	and its owner must also be put to death.
c8529	If payment is demanded of him {instead},
c8530	he may redeem his life by paying the full
c8531	amount demanded of him.
c8532	If [the ox] gores a son
c8533	or a daughter,
c8534	it shall be done to him according to the same rule.
c8535	If the ox gores a manservant or maidservant,
c8536	[the owner] must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of that servant,
c8537	and the ox must be stoned.
c8538	If a man opens
c8539	or digs a pit
c8540	and fails to cover it,
c8541	and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
c8542	the owner of the pit shall make restitution;
c8543	he must pay its owner,
c8544	and the dead [animal] will be his.
c8545	If a man’s ox injures his neighbor’s ox
c8546	and it dies,
c8547	they must sell the live [one]
c8548	and divide the proceeds;
c8549	they also must divide the dead animal.
c8550	But if it was known
c8551	that the ox had a habit of goring,
c8552	yet its owner failed to restrain it,
c8553	he shall pay full compensation, ox for ox,
c8554	and the dead [animal] will be his.
c8555	If a man steals an ox or a sheep
c8556	and slaughters
c8557	or sells it,
c8558	he must repay five oxen for an ox
c8559	and four sheep for a sheep.
c8560	If a thief is caught breaking in
c8561	and is beaten
c8562	to death,
c8563	no one shall be guilty of bloodshed.
c8564	But if it happens after sunrise,
c8565	there is guilt for his bloodshed
c8566	A thief must make full restitution;
c8567	if he has nothing,
c8568	he himself shall be sold for his theft.
c8569	If what was stolen is actually found alive in his possession— whether ox or donkey or sheep—
c8570	he must pay back double.
c8571	If a man grazes his livestock in a field or vineyard
c8572	and allows them to stray
c8573	so that they graze in someone else’s field,
c8574	he must make restitution from the best of his own field or vineyard.
c8575	If a fire breaks out
c8576	and spreads to thornbushes
c8577	so that it consumes stacked or standing grain, or the whole field,
c8578	must make full restitution.
c8579	the one who started the fire
c8580	If a man gives his neighbor money or goods
c8581	for safekeeping
c8582	and they are stolen from the neighbor’s house,
c8583	the thief, if caught,
c8584	must pay back double.
c8585	If the thief is not found,
c8586	the owner of the house must appear before the judges
c8587	to determine whether he has taken his neighbor’s property.
c8588	In all cases of illegal possession of an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or any lost item
c8589	that someone claims,
c8590	‘This is mine,’
c8591	both parties shall bring their cases before the judges.
c8592	The one whom the judges condemn
c8593	must pay back double to his neighbor.
c8594	If a man gives a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any other animal ... by his neighbor, ... or
c8595	to be cared for
c8596	but it dies
c8597	or is injured
c8598	stolen
c8599	while no one is watching,
c8600	an oath before the LORD shall be made between the parties
c8601	to determine whether or not the man has taken his neighbor’s property.
c8602	The owner must accept [the oath]
c8603	and require no restitution.
c8604	But if [the animal] was actually stolen from [the neighbor],
c8605	he must make restitution to the owner.
c8606	If it was torn to pieces,
c8607	he shall bring it as evidence;
c8608	he need not make restitution for the torn carcass.
c8609	If a man borrows [an animal] from his neighbor
c8610	and it is injured
c8611	or dies
c8612	while its owner is not present,
c8613	he must make full restitution.
c8614	If the owner was present,
c8615	no restitution is required.
c8616	If [the animal] was rented,
c8617	the fee covers the loss.
c8618	If a man seduces a virgin
c8619	who is not pledged in marriage
c8620	and sleeps with her,
c8621	he must pay the full dowry for her to be his wife.
c8622	If her father absolutely refuses
c8623	to give her to him,
c8624	he still must pay an amount comparable to the bridal price of a virgin.
c8625	You must not allow a sorceress to live.
c8626	Whoever
c8627	has sexual relations with an animal
c8628	must surely be put to death.
c8629	Whoever sacrifices to any god
c8630	must be utterly destroyed.
c8631	except the LORD alone
c8632	You must not exploit ... a foreign resident,
c8633	or oppress
c8634	for you [yourselves] were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
c8635	You must not mistreat any widow or orphan.
c8636	If you do mistreat them,
c8637	[and] they cry out to Me in distress,
c8638	I will surely hear their cry.
c8639	My anger will be kindled,
c8640	and I will kill you with the sword;
c8641	then your wives will become widows
c8642	and your children [will be] fatherless.
c8643	If you lend money to [one of] my people among you [who is] poor,
c8644	you must not act as a creditor to him;
c8645	you are not to charge him any interest.
c8646	If you take your neighbor’s cloak as collateral,
c8647	by sunset,
c8648	return it to him
c8649	because [his cloak] is the only covering
c8650	he has [for] his body.
c8651	What else will he sleep in?
c8653	And if he cries out to Me,
c8654	I will hear,
c8655	for I am compassionate.
c8656	You must not blaspheme God
c8657	or curse the ruler of your people.
c8658	You must not hold back [offerings] from your granaries or vats.
c8659	You are to give Me the firstborn of your sons.
c8660	You shall do likewise with your cattle and your sheep.
c8661	Let them stay with their mothers for seven days,
c8662	but on the eighth day you are to give them to Me.
c8663	You are to be My holy people.
c8664	the meat
c8665	of a mauled animal found in the field;
c8666	You must not eat
c8667	you are to throw it to the dogs.
c8668	You shall not spread a false report.
c8669	Do not join the wicked
c8670	by being a malicious witness.
c8671	You shall not follow a crowd in wrongdoing.
c8672	When you testify in a lawsuit, do not
c8673	by siding with a crowd.
c8674	pervert justice
c8675	And do not show favoritism to a poor man in his lawsuit.
c8676	If you encounter your enemy’s ... ox or donkey,
c8677	stray
c8678	you must return it to him.
c8679	If you see the donkey of one who hates you
c8680	fallen under its load,
c8681	do not
c8682	leave it there;
c8683	you must help him with it.
c8684	You shall not deny justice to the poor in their lawsuits.
c8685	Stay far away from a false accusation.
c8686	Do not kill the innocent and the just,
c8687	for I will not acquit the guilty.
c8688	Do not accept a bribe,
c8689	for a bribe blinds those who see
c8690	and twists the words of the righteous.
c8691	Do not oppress a foreign resident,
c8692	since you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners;
c8693	for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
c8694	For six years you are to sow your land
c8695	and gather its produce,
c8696	but in the seventh [year] you must let it rest
c8697	and lie fallow,
c8698	so that the poor among your people may eat
c8699	of the field, and the wild animals may consume what they leave.
c8700	Do the same with your vineyard and olive grove.
c8701	For six days you are to do your work,
c8702	but on the seventh day you must cease,
c8703	so that your ox and your donkey may rest,
c8704	and the son of your maidservant may be refreshed, as well as the foreign resident.
c8705	to everything
c8706	I have said to you.
c8707	Pay close attention
c8708	You must not invoke the names of other gods;
c8709	they must not be heard on your lips.
c8710	Three times a year you are to celebrate a feast to Me.
c8711	You are to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread
c8712	you are to eat unleavened bread for seven days,
c8713	as I commanded you:
c8714	At the appointed time in the month of Abib
c8715	because that [was the month] you came out of Egypt.
c8716	No one may appear before Me empty-handed.
c8717	[You are also to observe] the Feast of Harvest with the firstfruits of the produce
c8718	from what you sow in the field.
c8719	And [observe] the Feast of Ingathering
c8720	at the end of the year,
c8721	when you gather your produce from the field.
c8722	Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD.
c8723	You must not offer the blood of My sacrifices with anything leavened,
c8724	nor may the fat of My feast remain until morning.
c8725	Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil into the house of the LORD your God.
c8726	You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
c8727	Behold, I am sending an angel before you
c8728	to protect you along the way
c8729	and to bring you to the place
c8730	I have prepared.
c8731	Pay attention to him
c8732	and listen to his voice;
c8733	do not defy him,
c8734	for he will not forgive rebellion,
c8735	since My Name is in him.
c8736	But
c8737	if you will listen carefully to his voice
c8738	and do everything
c8739	I say,
c8740	I will be an enemy to your enemies
c8741	and a foe to your foes.
c8742	For My angel will go before you
c8743	and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites,
c8744	and I will annihilate them.
c8745	You must not bow down to their gods
c8746	or serve them or
c8747	follow their practices.
c8748	Instead, you are to demolish them
c8749	and smash their sacred stones to pieces.
c8750	So you shall serve the LORD your God,
c8751	and He will bless your bread and your water.
c8752	And I will take away sickness from among you.
c8753	No {woman} in your land will miscarry or be barren;
c8754	I will fulfill the number of your days.
c8755	I will send My terror ahead of you
c8756	and throw into confusion every nation
c8757	you encounter.
c8758	I will make all your enemies turn and run.
c8759	I will send the hornet before you
c8760	to drive the Hivites and Canaanites and Hittites out of your way.
c8761	I will not drive them out before you in a single year;
c8762	otherwise the land would become desolate
c8763	and wild animals would multiply against you.
c8764	Little by little I will drive them out ahead of you,
c8765	until you become fruitful
c8766	and possess the land.
c8767	And I will fix your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the [Euphrates].
c8768	For I will deliver the inhabitants into your hand,
c8769	and you will drive them out before you.
c8770	You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.
c8771	They must not remain in your land,
c8772	lest they cause you to sin against Me.
c8773	For if you serve their gods,
c8774	it will surely be a snare to you.”
c8775	Then [the LORD] said to Moses,
c8776	“Come up to the LORD— you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of Israel’s elders—
c8777	and you are to worship at a distance.
c8778	Moses alone shall approach the LORD,
c8779	but the others {must} not come near.
c8780	And the people may not go up with him.”
c8781	When Moses came
c8782	and told the people all the words and ordinances of the LORD,
c8783	[they] all responded with one voice:
c8785	“All the words
c8786	that the LORD has spoken,
c8787	we will do.”
c8788	And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD.
c8789	{Early} the next morning he got up
c8790	and built an altar at the base of the mountain,
c8791	along with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.
c8792	Then he sent out some young men of Israel,
c8793	and they offered burnt offerings
c8794	and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the LORD.
c8795	Moses took half of the blood
c8796	and put it in basins,
c8797	and the other half he sprinkled on the altar.
c8798	Then he took the Book of the Covenant
c8799	and read it to the people,
c8800	who replied,
c8801	“All
c8802	that the LORD has spoken
c8803	we will do,
c8804	and we will be obedient.”
c8805	So Moses took the blood,
c8806	sprinkled it on the people,
c8807	and said,
c8808	“This is the blood of the covenant
c8809	that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.”
c8810	Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,
c8811	and they saw the God of Israel.
c8812	Under His feet was a work like a pavement made of sapphire,
c8813	as clear as the sky itself.
c8814	But ... did not lay His hand on the nobles of Israel;
c8815	God ... they saw Him,
c8816	and they ate
c8817	and drank.
c8818	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c8819	“Come up to Me on the mountain
c8820	and stay here,
c8821	so that I may give you the tablets of stone, with the law and commandments
c8822	I have written
c8823	for their instruction.”
c8824	So Moses set out with Joshua his attendant
c8825	and went up on the mountain of God.
c8826	And he said to the elders, ... to you.
c8827	“Wait here
c8828	for us until we return ... to them.”
c8829	are here
c8830	Aaron and Hur ... with you.
c8831	Whoever has a dispute
c8832	can go
c8833	When Moses went up on the mountain,
c8834	the cloud covered it,
c8835	and the glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai.
c8836	For six days the cloud covered it,
c8837	and on the seventh day [the LORD] called to Moses from within the cloud.
c8838	And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop in the eyes of the Israelites.
c8839	Moses entered the cloud
c8840	as he went up on the mountain,
c8841	and he remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
c8842	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c8844	“Tell the Israelites
c8845	to bring Me an offering.
c8846	from every man
c8847	whose heart compels him.
c8848	You are to receive My offering
c8849	This is the offering
c8850	you are to accept from them:

c8854	oil for lighting; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
c8855	and onyx and other gemstones to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
c8856	And they are to make a sanctuary for Me,
c8857	so that I may dwell among them.

c8859	the tabernacle and design all its furnishings ... the pattern I will show you.
c8860	You must make

c8864	and a cubit and a half high.
c8865	Overlay it with pure gold
c8866	both inside and out,
c8867	and make a gold molding around it.
c8868	Cast four gold rings for it
c8869	and fasten them to its four feet,

c8872	And make poles of acacia wood

c8875	in order to carry the ark.
c8876	The poles are to remain in the rings of the ark;
c8877	they must not be removed.
c8878	And put into the ark the Testimony,
c8879	which I will give you.
c8880	And you are to make a mercy seat of pure gold,
c8881	two and a half cubits long
c8882	and a cubit and a half wide.
c8883	And make two cherubim ... gold

c8888	The cherubim are to have wings spread upward,
c8889	overshadowing the mercy seat,
c8890	and they are to face one another. ... toward
c8891	The faces of the cherubim should look ... the mercy seat.
c8892	Set the mercy seat atop the ark,
c8893	and put the Testimony ... into the ark.
c8894	that I will give you
c8895	And I will meet with you there
c8896	above the mercy seat, between the two cherubim ... I will commune with you
c8897	that are over the Ark of the Testimony;
c8898	about all
c8899	that I command you regarding the Israelites.
c8900	You are also to make a table of acacia wood,
c8901	two cubits long,
c8902	one cubit wide,
c8903	and a cubit and a half high.
c8904	Overlay it with pure gold
c8905	and construct a gold border around it.
c8906	Also make a rim around it a handbreadth in width,
c8907	and put a gold molding on the rim.
c8908	Make four gold rings for [the table]
c8909	and attach the rings to the four corners
c8910	at its four legs.
c8911	The rings are to be close to the rim, to serve as holders for the poles
c8912	to carry the table.

c8917	for pouring drink offerings.
c8918	Make them out of pure gold.

c8926	There are to be three cups shaped like almond blossoms ... on one branch,
c8927	with buds and petals
c8928	three on the next branch,
c8930	and the same for all six branches

c8932	And on the lampstand there shall be four cups shaped like almond blossoms
c8933	with buds and petals.
c8934	branches ... a bud must be under the first pair
c8935	of branches ,a bud under the second pair

c8939	Their buds and branches are to be
c8940	all of one piece, hammered out of gold.
c8941	Make seven lamps
c8942	and set them up on [the lampstand] so that [they]
c8943	illuminate the area in front of it.
c8944	The wick trimmers and their trays must be of pure gold.
c8945	[The lampstand] and all these utensils shall be made from a talent of pure gold.
c8946	See that
c8947	you make [everything] according to the pattern
c8948	shown you on the mountain.
c8949	You are to construct the tabernacle [itself] [with] ten curtains
c8950	of finely spun linen, [each] with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, [and] cherubim skillfully worked into them.
c8951	Each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits long
c8952	and four cubits wide—
c8953	all curtains the same size.
c8954	Five of the curtains are to be joined

c8956	and the other five curtains joined
c8957	[as well].
c8958	Make loops of blue [material] on the edge of the end curtain in the first set,
c8959	and do the same for the end curtain in the second set.
c8960	Make fifty loops ... of the end curtain
c8961	on the edge
c8962	of both sets,
c8963	so that the loops line up
c8964	opposite one another.
c8965	Make fifty gold clasps {as well},
c8966	and join the curtains

c8978	and fifty along the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set.
c8979	Make fifty bronze clasps
c8980	and put [them] through the loops
c8981	to join the tent
c8982	together as a single unit.
c8983	As for the overlap
c8984	that remains of the tent curtains,
c8985	the half curtain
c8986	that is left over
c8987	shall hang down over the back of the tabernacle.

c8989	And the tent curtains [will be] ... longer ... and the excess
c8990	will hang over the sides of the tabernacle

c9024	Overlay the frames with gold
c9025	and make gold rings

c9067	and overlay them with bronze.
c9068	The poles are to be inserted into the rings
c9069	so that the poles are on two sides of the altar
c9070	when it is carried.
c9071	Construct the altar with boards so that it is hollow.
c9072	just as you were shown on the mountain.

c9107	And you are to command the Israelites
c9108	to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light,
c9109	to keep the lamps burning continually.
c9110	In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil
c9111	that is in front of the Testimony,
c9112	Aaron and his sons are to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening until morning.
c9113	This is to be a perpetual statute for the Israelites throughout their generations.
c9114	Next, bring near to you your brother Aaron

c9185	[he] shall bear the names of the sons of Israel over his heart on the breastpiece of judgment,
c9186	Whenever [Aaron] enters the Holy [Place],
c9187	as a continual reminder before the LORD.
c9188	And place the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece of judgment,
c9189	so that they will also be over Aaron’s heart
c9190	whenever he comes before the LORD.
c9191	Aaron will continually carry the judgment of the sons of Israel over his heart before the LORD.
c9192	You are to make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue yarn,
c9193	with an opening at its top in the center.
c9194	Around [the opening] shall be a woven collar with an opening
c9195	like that of a garment, so that it
c9196	will not tear.
c9197	Make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn ... hem,
c9198	all the way around the lower
c9199	with gold bells between them,
c9200	so that gold bells and pomegranates alternate around the lower hem of the robe.
c9201	Aaron must wear the robe
c9202	whenever he ministers,
c9203	and its sound will be heard
c9204	when he enters ... the sanctuary before the LORD,
c9205	or exits
c9206	so that he will not die.
c9207	You are to make a plate of pure gold
c9208	and engrave on it as a seal:
c9209	HOLY TO THE LORD.
c9210	Fasten a blue cord to it
c9211	to attach it to the turban; it is to be
c9212	on the front of the turban.
c9213	It will be on Aaron’s forehead,
c9214	so that [he] may bear the iniquity of the holy things
c9215	that the sons of Israel consecrate with regard to all their holy gifts.
c9216	It shall always be on his forehead, so that [the people] may be acceptable before the LORD.
c9217	You are to weave the tunic with fine linen,
c9218	make the turban of fine linen,
c9219	and fashion an embroidered sash.
c9220	Make tunics, ... for Aaron’s sons,
c9221	sashes, ... to give
c9222	and headbands ... them dignity and splendor.
c9223	After you put [these garments] on your brother Aaron and his sons,
c9224	anoint them,
c9225	ordain them,
c9226	and consecrate them
c9227	so that they may serve Me as priests.
c9228	Make linen undergarments
c9229	to cover their bare flesh,
c9230	extending from waist to thigh.
c9231	Aaron and his sons must wear them
c9232	whenever they enter the tent of meeting
c9233	or approach the altar
c9234	to minister in the Holy [Place],
c9235	so that they will not incur guilt
c9236	and die.
c9237	This is to be a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants.
c9238	Now this
c9239	is what you are to do
c9240	to consecrate them
c9241	to serve Me as priests:
c9242	Take a young bull and two rams without blemish,
c9243	along with unleavened bread, unleavened cakes
c9244	mixed with oil,
c9245	and unleavened wafers
c9246	anointed with oil.
c9247	Make them out of fine wheat flour,
c9248	put them in a basket,
c9249	and present them in the basket,
c9250	along with the bull and the two rams.
c9251	Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
c9252	and wash them with water.
c9253	Take the garments
c9254	and clothe Aaron with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself, and the breastplate.
c9255	Fasten the ephod on him with its woven waistband.
c9256	Put the turban on his head
c9257	and attach the holy diadem to the turban.
c9258	Then take the anointing oil
c9259	by pouring it on his head.
c9260	and anoint him
c9261	Bring his sons {as well}
c9262	and clothe them with tunics.
c9263	Wrap the sashes around Aaron and his sons
c9264	and put headbands on them.
c9265	The priesthood shall be theirs by a perpetual statute.
c9266	In this way you are to ordain Aaron and his sons.
c9267	Bring the bull to the front of the Tent of Meeting,
c9268	and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on [its] head.
c9269	And you shall slaughter the bull before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c9270	Take some of the blood of the bull
c9271	and put [it] on the horns of the altar with your finger;
c9272	then pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
c9273	Take all the fat
c9274	that covers the entrails
c9275	and the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with the fat
c9276	on them,
c9277	and burn them on the altar.
c9278	But burn the flesh of the bull and its hide and dung outside the camp;
c9279	it [is] a sin offering.
c9280	Take one of the rams,
c9281	and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on [its] head.
c9282	You are to slaughter the ram,
c9283	take its blood,
c9284	and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar.
c9285	Cut the ram into pieces,
c9286	wash the entrails and legs,
c9287	and place them with its head and other pieces.
c9288	Then burn the entire ram on the altar;
c9289	it is a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma,
c9290	an offering made to the LORD by fire.
c9291	Take the second ram,
c9292	and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on [its] head.
c9293	Slaughter the ram,
c9294	take some of its blood,
c9295	and put it on the right earlobes of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet.
c9296	Sprinkle the remaining blood on all sides of the altar.
c9297	And take some of the blood
c9298	on the altar
c9299	and some of the anointing oil
c9300	and sprinkle [it] on Aaron and his garments, as well as on his sons and their garments. ... as well as his sons
c9301	Then he and his garments will be consecrated, ... and their garments.
c9302	Take the fat from the ram, the fat tail, the fat
c9303	covering the entrails,
c9304	the lobe of the liver, both kidneys and the fat
c9305	on them,
c9306	and the right thigh
c9307	(since this is a ram for ordination),
c9308	along with one loaf of bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread
c9309	that is before the LORD.
c9310	Put all these into the hands of Aaron and his sons
c9311	and wave them before the LORD as a wave offering.
c9312	Then take them from their hands
c9313	and burn them on the altar atop the burnt offering as a pleasing aroma before the LORD;
c9314	it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c9315	Take the breast of the ram ... ordination
c9316	of Aaron’s
c9317	and wave it before the LORD as a wave offering,
c9318	and it will be your portion.
c9319	Consecrate ... the breast of the wave offering ... and the thigh of the heave offering
c9320	that is waved
c9321	that is lifted up from the ram of ordination.
c9322	for Aaron
c9323	and his sons
c9324	This will belong to Aaron and his sons as a regular portion from the Israelites,
c9325	for it is the heave offering
c9326	the Israelites will make ... from their peace offerings.
c9327	to the LORD
c9328	The holy garments
c9329	that belong to Aaron
c9330	will belong to his sons after him, so they can be anointed
c9331	and ordained in them.
c9332	The son ... succeeds him as priest ... must wear them for seven days.
c9333	who ... and enters the Tent of Meeting
c9334	to minister in the Holy [Place]
c9335	You are to take the ram of ordination
c9336	and boil its flesh in a holy place.
c9337	Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread
c9338	that [is] in the basket.
c9339	At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
c9340	They must eat
c9341	those things by which atonement was made
c9342	for their ordination
c9343	and consecration.
c9344	But no outsider may eat them,
c9345	because these things are sacred.
c9346	And if any of the meat of ordination or any bread is left until the morning,
c9347	burn up the remainder.
c9348	It must not be eaten,
c9349	because it is sacred.
c9350	This is what you are to do for Aaron and his sons
c9351	based on all
c9352	that I have commanded you,
c9353	taking seven days to ordain them.
c9354	Sacrifice a bull as a sin offering each day for atonement.
c9355	Purify the altar ... for it,
c9356	by making atonement
c9357	and anoint it
c9358	to consecrate it.
c9359	For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar
c9360	and consecrate it.
c9361	Then the altar will become most holy;
c9362	whatever
c9363	touches the altar
c9364	will be holy.
c9365	This
c9366	is what you are to offer ... on the altar,
c9367	regularly ... each day: two lambs [that are] a year old.
c9368	In the morning offer one lamb,
c9369	and at twilight offer the other.
c9370	[offer] a tenth [of an ephah] of fine flour,
c9371	mixed with a quarter hin of oil from pressed [olives],
c9372	With the first lamb ... and a drink offering of a quarter hin of wine.
c9373	And you shall offer the second lamb at twilight
c9374	with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning, as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c9375	For the generations to come, this burnt offering shall be made regularly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD,
c9376	where I will meet
c9377	you to speak with you.
c9378	I will also meet with the Israelites there,
c9379	and that place will be consecrated by My glory.
c9380	So I will consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the altar,
c9381	and I will consecrate Aaron and his sons
c9382	to serve Me as priests.
c9383	Then I will dwell among the Israelites
c9384	and be their God.
c9385	And they will know
c9386	that I am the LORD their God,
c9387	who brought them out of the land of Egypt,
c9388	so that I might dwell among them.
c9389	I am the LORD their God.
c9390	You are also to make an altar ... for the burning of incense.
c9391	of acacia wood
c9392	a cubit long,
c9393	a cubit wide,
c9394	It is to be square,
c9395	and two cubits high.
c9396	Its horns must be of one piece.
c9397	Overlay the top and all the sides and horns with pure gold,
c9398	and make a molding of gold all around it.
c9399	And make for it two gold rings below the molding
c9400	on opposite sides
c9401	to hold the poles
c9402	used to carry it.
c9403	Make the poles of acacia wood
c9404	and overlay them with gold.
c9405	Place [the altar] in front of the veil
c9406	that is before the Ark of the Testimony— ... that
c9407	before the mercy seat
c9408	is over the Testimony— where
c9409	I will meet with you.
c9410	And Aaron is to burn fragrant incense on it
c9411	every morning
c9412	when he tends the lamps.
c9415	When Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight,
c9416	he must burn
c9417	the incense perpetually before the LORD for the generations to come.
c9418	On [this altar] you must not offer unapproved incense or a burnt offering or grain offering,
c9419	nor are you to pour a drink offering on it.
c9420	Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on the horns [of the altar]. ... with the blood of the sin offering of atonement.
c9421	Throughout your generations he shall make atonement on it annually
c9422	The altar [is] most holy to the LORD.”
c9423	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c9425	“When you take a census of the Israelites to number them,
c9426	must pay
c9427	each man ... a ransom for his life
c9428	the LORD
c9429	when he is counted.
c9430	Then no plague will come upon them
c9431	when they are numbered.
c9432	Everyone ... must pay
c9433	who crosses over to those counted
c9434	a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel,
c9435	[which weighs] twenty gerahs.
c9436	This half shekel is an offering to the LORD.
c9437	Everyone
c9438	who crosses over
c9439	twenty years of age or older ... must give this offering to the LORD.
c9440	the rich shall not give more
c9441	than a half shekel, nor shall the poor give less.
c9442	In making the offering to the LORD
c9443	to atone for your lives,
c9444	Take the atonement money from the sons of Israel
c9445	and use it for the service of the Tent of Meeting.
c9446	It will serve as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD
c9447	to make an atonement for your lives.”
c9448	Again, the LORD said to Moses,
c9450	“You are to make a bronze basin
c9451	with a bronze stand
c9452	for washing.
c9453	Set it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar,
c9454	and put water into it,
c9455	with which Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet.
c9456	Whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting
c9457	they must wash with water
c9458	so that they will not die.
c9459	or approach the altar
c9460	to minister
c9461	by presenting an offering made by fire to the LORD,
c9462	Thus they are to wash their hands and feet
c9463	so that they will not die;
c9464	this shall be a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come.”
c9465	Once again, The LORD said to Moses,
c9467	“Take the finest spices: 500shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much (250shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250shekels of fragrant cane,
c9468	500shekels of cassia— all according to the sanctuary shekel— and a hin of olive oil.
c9469	Prepare from these a holy anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer;
c9470	it will be a holy anointing oil.
c9471	Use [this oil] to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Testimony,
c9472	the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense,
c9473	the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.
c9474	You are to consecrate them
c9475	so that they will be most holy.
c9476	Whatever
c9477	touches them
c9478	{will} be holy.
c9479	Anoint Aaron and his sons
c9480	and consecrate them
c9481	to serve Me as priests.
c9482	And you are to tell the Israelites,
c9484	‘This will be My sacred anointing oil for the generations to come.
c9485	It must not be used to anoint an ordinary man,
c9486	and you must not make anything like it with the same formula.
c9487	It is holy,
c9488	and it must be holy to you.
c9489	Anyone
c9490	who mixes perfume like it
c9491	or puts it on a layman
c9492	shall be cut off from his people.’”
c9493	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c9494	“Take fragrant spices— gum resin, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense—
c9495	in equal measures,
c9496	and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy.
c9497	Grind some of it into fine powder
c9498	and place it in front of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting,
c9499	where I will meet with you.
c9500	It shall be most holy to you.
c9501	incense
c9502	You are never to use
c9503	this formula to make ... for yourselves;
c9504	you shall regard it as sacred to the LORD.
c9505	Anyone
c9506	who makes something like
c9507	it to enjoy its fragrance
c9508	shall be cut off from his people.”
c9509	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c9511	“See,
c9512	I have appointed by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
c9513	And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, and ability in all kinds of craftsmanship,
c9514	to design
c9515	artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze,
c9516	to cut gemstones
c9517	for settings,
c9518	and to carve wood,
c9519	so that he may be a master of every craft.
c9520	Moreover, I
c9521	have selected Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, as his assistant.
c9522	I have also given skill to all the craftsmen,
c9523	that they may fashion all
c9524	that I have commanded you:
c9525	the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Testimony and the mercy seat
c9526	upon it,
c9527	and all the other furnishings of the tent—
c9528	the table with its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense,
c9529	the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand—
c9530	as well as the woven garments, both the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons
c9531	to serve as priests,
c9532	in addition to the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place.
c9533	them according to all
c9534	that I have commanded you.”
c9535	They are to make
c9536	And the LORD said to Moses,
c9538	“Tell the Israelites,
c9540	‘Surely you must observe My Sabbaths,
c9541	for this will be a sign between Me and you for the generations to come,
c9542	so that you may know
c9543	that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
c9544	Observe the Sabbath,
c9545	for it is holy to you.
c9546	Everyone who profanes it
c9547	must surely be put to death.
c9548	Whoever
c9549	does work on [that day]
c9550	must be cut off from his people.
c9551	For six days work may be done,
c9552	but the seventh day must be a Sabbath of solemn rest,
c9553	holy to the LORD.
c9554	Whoever
c9555	does [any] work on the Sabbath day
c9556	must surely be put to death.
c9557	The Israelites must observe the Sabbath,
c9558	celebrating it as a lasting covenant for the generations to come.
c9559	It is a sign between Me and the Israelites forever;
c9560	for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth,
c9561	but on the seventh day He rested
c9562	and was refreshed.’”
c9563	He gave Moses
c9564	When [the LORD] had finished
c9565	speaking with him on Mount Sinai,
c9566	the two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone
c9567	inscribed by the finger of God.
c9568	Now when the people saw
c9569	that Moses was delayed
c9570	in coming down from the mountain,
c9571	they gathered around Aaron
c9572	and said,
c9573	“Come,
c9574	make us gods
c9575	who will go before us.
c9576	As for this Moses
c9577	who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
c9578	we do not know
c9579	what has happened to him!”
c9580	So Aaron told them,
c9581	“Take off the gold earrings
c9582	that are on your wives and sons and daughters,
c9583	and bring them to me.”
c9584	Then all the people took off their gold earrings
c9586	and brought them to Aaron.
c9587	He took [the gold] from their hands,
c9588	and with an engraving tool ... it
c9589	he fashioned ... into a molten calf.
c9590	And they said,
c9591	these are your gods,
c9592	“O Israel,
c9593	who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”
c9594	When Aaron saw this,
c9595	he built an altar before [the calf]
c9596	and proclaimed:
c9598	“Tomorrow [shall be] a feast to the LORD.”
c9599	So the next day they arose,
c9600	offered burnt offerings,
c9601	and presented peace offerings.
c9602	And the people sat down
c9603	to eat
c9604	and drink,
c9605	and got up
c9606	to indulge in revelry.
c9607	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c9608	“Go down at once!
c9610	For your people, ... have corrupted themselves.
c9611	whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt,
c9612	How quickly they have turned aside from the way
c9613	I commanded them. ... who
c9614	They have made for themselves a molten calf
c9615	and have bowed down to it,
c9616	sacrificed to it,
c9617	and said,
c9618	this is your God,
c9619	‘O Israel,
c9620	brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’”
c9621	The LORD also said to Moses,
c9622	“I have seen this people,
c9623	are indeed
c9624	and they ... a stiff-necked people.
c9625	Now
c9626	leave Me alone,
c9627	so that My anger may burn against them
c9628	and consume them.
c9629	Then I will make you into a great nation.”
c9630	But Moses entreated the LORD his God,
c9631	saying,
c9632	why
c9633	“O LORD,
c9634	does Your anger burn against Your people,
c9635	whom You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?
c9636	Why should the Egyptians declare,
c9638	‘He brought them out with evil intent,
c9639	to kill them in the mountains
c9640	and wipe them from the face of the earth’?
c9641	Turn from Your fierce anger
c9642	and relent from {doing} harm to Your people.
c9643	Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom
c9644	You swore by Your very self ... that
c9645	when You declared,
c9646	‘{I will make} your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky,
c9647	all this land
c9648	I have promised,
c9649	and I will give your descendants
c9650	and it shall be their inheritance forever.’”
c9651	So the LORD relented from the calamity
c9652	He had threatened
c9653	to bring on His people.
c9654	turned
c9655	Then Moses ... and went down the mountain
c9656	with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands.
c9657	were inscribed on both sides,
c9658	They ... front and back.
c9659	The tablets
c9660	were the work of God,
c9661	and the writing
c9662	[was] the writing of God,
c9663	engraved on the tablets.
c9664	When Joshua heard the sound of the people shouting,
c9665	he said to Moses,
c9666	“The sound of war [is] in the camp.”
c9667	But Moses replied:
c9668	“It is neither the cry of victory
c9669	nor the cry of defeat;
c9670	I hear the sound of singing!”
c9672	As [Moses] approached the camp
c9673	and saw the calf and the dancing,
c9674	he burned with anger
c9675	and threw the tablets out of his hands,
c9676	smashing them at the base of the mountain.
c9677	Then he took the calf
c9678	they had made,
c9679	burned it in the fire,
c9680	ground [it]
c9681	to powder,
c9682	and scattered [the powder] over the face of the water.
c9683	Then he forced the Israelites to drink it.
c9684	Moses asked Aaron,
c9685	“What did this people do to you,”
c9686	“that you have led them into so great a sin?”
c9687	Aaron replied.
c9688	“Do not be enraged, my lord,”
c9689	“You yourself know that the people
c9690	are intent on evil.
c9691	They told me,
c9692	‘Make us gods
c9693	who will go before us.
c9694	As for this Moses
c9695	who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
c9696	we do not know
c9697	what has happened to him!’
c9698	So I said to them,
c9699	‘Whoever has gold,
c9700	let him take it off,’
c9701	and they gave it to me.
c9702	And when I cast it into the fire,
c9703	out came this calf!”
c9704	Moses saw that the people
c9705	were out of control, for
c9706	Aaron had let them run wild and become a laughingstock to their enemies.
c9707	So Moses stood at the entrance of the camp
c9708	and said,
c9709	“Whoever is for the LORD,
c9710	come to me.”
c9711	And all the Levites gathered around him.
c9712	He told them,
c9713	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c9714	is to fasten
c9715	‘Each of you men ... his sword to his side,
c9716	go back and forth
c9717	through the camp from gate to gate,
c9718	and slay
c9719	his brother,
c9720	his friend,
c9721	and his neighbor.’”
c9722	The Levites did as Moses commanded,
c9723	and that day about three thousand of the people fell dead.
c9724	Afterward, Moses said,
c9725	“Today you have been ordained for service to the LORD,
c9726	since each man went against his son and his brother;
c9727	so He has bestowed a blessing on you this day.”
c9728	The next day
c9729	Moses said to the people,
c9730	“You have committed a great sin.
c9731	Now
c9732	I will go up to the LORD;
c9733	perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”
c9734	So Moses returned to the LORD
c9735	and said,
c9736	“Oh, what a great sin these people have committed;
c9737	they have made gods of gold for themselves.
c9738	Yet now,
c9739	if You would only forgive their sin
c9740	But if not,
c9741	please blot me out of the book
c9742	that You have written.”
c9743	The LORD replied to Moses,
c9744	“Whoever
c9745	has sinned against Me,
c9746	I will erase from My book.
c9747	Now
c9748	go,
c9749	lead the people
c9750	to the place I told you.
c9751	Behold,
c9752	My angel shall go before you.
c9753	But on the day I settle accounts,
c9754	I will punish them for their sin.”
c9755	And the LORD sent a plague on the people
c9756	because of what they had done with the calf
c9757	that Aaron had made.
c9758	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c9759	[and] go
c9760	“Leave this place, you and the people
c9761	you brought up out of the land of Egypt,
c9762	to the land
c9763	I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
c9764	when I said,
c9765	‘I will give it to your descendants.’
c9766	And I will send an angel before you
c9767	and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
c9768	Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey.
c9769	But I will not go with you,
c9770	because you are a stiff-necked people;
c9771	otherwise, I might destroy you on the way.”
c9772	When the people heard these bad tidings,
c9773	they went into mourning,
c9774	and no ... put on
c9775	one ... any of his jewelry.
c9776	For the LORD had said to Moses,
c9777	“Tell the Israelites,
c9778	‘You are a stiff-necked people.
c9779	If I should go with you for a single moment,
c9780	I would destroy you.
c9781	Now
c9782	take off your jewelry,
c9783	and I will decide
c9784	what to do with you.’”
c9785	So the Israelites remained stripped of their jewelry from Mount Horeb [onward].
c9786	Now Moses used to take the tent
c9787	and pitch it
c9788	at a distance outside the camp.
c9789	He called it the Tent of Meeting,
c9790	and
c9791	anyone
c9792	inquiring of the LORD
c9793	would go to the Tent of Meeting
c9794	outside the camp.
c9795	Then,
c9796	whenever Moses went out to the tent,
c9797	all the people would stand
c9799	at the entrances of their tents
c9800	and watch Moses
c9801	until he entered the tent.
c9802	As
c9803	Moses entered the tent,
c9804	the pillar of cloud would come down
c9805	and remain at the entrance,
c9806	and the LORD would speak with Moses.
c9807	When all the people saw the pillar of cloud
c9808	standing at the entrance to the tent,
c9809	they would stand up
c9810	and worship,
c9811	each one at the entrance to his tent.
c9812	Thus the LORD would speak to Moses face to face,
c9813	as a man speaks with his friend.
c9814	Then Moses would return to the camp,
c9815	but his young assistant Joshua son of Nun would not leave the tent.
c9816	Moses said to the LORD,
c9817	“Look,
c9818	You have been telling me,
c9819	‘Lead this people up,’
c9820	but You have not let me know
c9821	whom You will send with me.
c9822	Yet You have said,
c9823	‘I know you by name,
c9824	and you have found favor in My sight.’
c9825	Now
c9826	if indeed I have found favor in Your sight,
c9827	please let me know Your ways,
c9828	that I may know You
c9829	and find favor in Your sight.
c9830	Remember
c9831	that this nation is Your people.”
c9832	And [the LORD] answered,
c9833	“My presence will go [with you]
c9834	,and I will give you rest.”
c9835	Moses replied,
c9836	“If Your presence does not go [with us],”
c9837	“do not lead us up from here.
c9838	For how then can it be known
c9839	that Your people and I have found favor in Your sight,
c9840	unless
c9841	You go with us?
c9842	[How else will] we be distinguished from all the other people
c9843	on the face of the earth?”
c9844	And the LORD said to Moses,
c9845	this very thing
c9846	you have asked,
c9847	“I will do
c9848	for you have found favor in My sight,
c9849	and I know you by name.”
c9850	Then Moses said,
c9851	“Please show me Your glory.”
c9852	[the LORD] replied,
c9853	“I will cause all My goodness to pass in front of you,”
c9854	“and I will proclaim [My] name— the LORD— before you.
c9855	I will have mercy
c9856	on whom I have mercy,
c9857	and I will have compassion
c9858	on whom I have compassion.”
c9859	And He added,
c9860	“You cannot
c9861	see My face,
c9862	for no one can see [Me]
c9863	and live.”
c9864	The LORD continued,
c9865	“There is a place near Me
c9866	where you are to stand upon a rock,
c9867	and when
c9868	My glory passes by,
c9869	I will put you in a cleft of the rock
c9870	and cover you with My hand
c9871	until I have passed by.
c9872	Then I will take My hand away,
c9873	and you will see My back;
c9874	but My face must not be seen.”
c9875	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c9876	“Chisel out two stone tablets like the original ones,
c9877	and I will write on them the words
c9878	that were on the first tablets,
c9879	which you broke.
c9880	Be ready in the morning,
c9881	and come up on Mount Sinai
c9882	to present yourself before Me on the mountaintop.
c9883	No one may go up with you;
c9884	in fact, no one may be seen anywhere on the mountain—
c9885	not even the flocks or herds may graze in front of the mountain.”
c9886	chiseled two stone tablets like the originals.
c9887	So Moses ... He rose early in the morning,
c9888	he ascended Mount Sinai
c9889	as the LORD had commanded him.
c9890	and taking the two stone tablets in his hand,
c9891	And the LORD descended in a cloud,
c9892	stood with him there,
c9893	and proclaimed His name, the LORD.
c9894	Then the LORD passed in front of [Moses]
c9895	and called out:
c9896	“The LORD, the LORD
c9897	God, is compassionate and gracious,
c9898	slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and truth,
c9899	maintaining loving devotion to a thousand [generations],
c9900	forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.
c9901	Yet He will by no means excuse [the guilty];
c9902	He will visit the iniquity of the fathers on their children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generations.”
c9903	Moses immediately
c9904	bowed down to the ground
c9905	and worshiped.
c9906	he said,
c9907	“if I have indeed found favor in Your sight, ... please
c9908	“O Lord,”
c9909	my Lord, ... go with us.
c9910	Although this is a stiff-necked people,
c9911	forgive our iniquity and sin,
c9912	and take us as Your inheritance.”
c9913	And the LORD said,
c9914	“Behold, I am making a covenant.
c9915	Before all your people I will perform wonders
c9916	that have never been done in any nation in all the world.
c9917	All the people ... will see
c9918	among whom you live
c9919	the LORD’s work,
c9920	for it [is] an awesome [thing]
c9921	that I am doing with you.
c9922	Observe
c9923	what I command you this day.
c9924	I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
c9925	Be careful
c9926	not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land
c9927	you are entering,
c9928	lest they become a snare in your midst.
c9929	Rather, you must tear down their altars,
c9930	smash their sacred stones,
c9931	and chop down their Asherah poles.
c9932	For you must not worship any other god,
c9933	for the LORD,
c9934	whose name [is] Jealous,
c9935	[is] a jealous God.
c9936	Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,
c9937	for when they prostitute themselves to their gods
c9938	and sacrifice to [them],
c9939	they will invite you,
c9940	and you will eat their sacrifices;
c9941	and when you take some of their daughters as brides for your sons,
c9942	their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods
c9943	and cause your sons [to do the same].
c9944	You shall make no molten gods for yourselves.
c9945	You are to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
c9946	For seven days ... you are to eat unleavened bread
c9947	at the appointed time in the month of Abib, ... as I commanded you.
c9948	For in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.
c9949	The first offspring of every womb belongs to Me,
c9950	including all ... males among your livestock,
c9951	the firstborn ... [whether] cattle or sheep.
c9952	You must redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb;
c9953	but if you do not redeem it,
c9954	break its neck.
c9955	You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons.
c9956	No one shall appear before Me empty-handed.
c9957	Six days you shall labor,
c9958	but on the seventh day you shall rest;
c9959	even in plowing and harvesting seasons, you must rest.
c9960	And you are to celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest,
c9961	and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
c9962	Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
c9963	For I will drive out the nations before you
c9964	and enlarge your borders,
c9965	and no one will covet your land
c9966	when you go up
c9967	to appear before the LORD your God.
c9968	three times a year
c9969	Do not offer the blood of My sacrifice along with anything leavened,
c9970	and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning.
c9971	Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God.
c9972	You shall not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
c9973	The LORD also said to Moses,
c9974	“Write down these words,
c9975	for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
c9976	So Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights
c9977	without eating bread
c9978	or drinking water.
c9979	[He wrote] on the tablets the words of the covenant— the Ten Commandments.
c9980	And
c9981	when Moses came down from Mount Sinai
c9982	with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands,
c9984	he was unaware
c9985	that his face had become radiant
c9986	from speaking with the LORD.
c9987	Aaron and all the Israelites looked at Moses,
c9988	and behold, his face was radiant.
c9989	And they were afraid
c9990	to approach him.
c9991	But Moses called out to them;
c9992	so Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him,
c9993	and Moses spoke to them.
c9994	And after this all the Israelites came near,
c9995	and [Moses] commanded them to do everything
c9996	that the LORD had told him on Mount Sinai.
c9997	When Moses had finished
c9998	speaking to them,
c9999	he put a veil over his face.
c10001	But whenever Moses went in before the LORD
c10002	to speak with Him,
c10003	he would remove the veil
c10004	until he came out.
c10005	And when he came out,
c10006	he would tell the Israelites
c10007	what he had been commanded,
c10008	and the Israelites would see ... the face of Moses
c10009	that ... was radiant. So Moses ... his face
c10010	would put the veil back over
c10011	until he went in
c10012	to speak with the LORD.
c10013	Then Moses assembled the entire congregation of the Israelites
c10014	and said to them,
c10015	“These are the things
c10016	that the LORD has commanded
c10017	you to do:
c10018	For six days work shall be done,
c10019	but on the seventh day you are to have a holy
c10020	Sabbath of complete rest to the LORD.
c10021	Anyone
c10022	who does work on [that day]
c10023	must be put to death.
c10024	Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”
c10025	Moses also told the entire congregation of the Israelites,
c10027	“This
c10028	is what the LORD has commanded:
c10030	Take from among you an offering to the LORD.
c10031	Let everyone whose heart is willing bring to the LORD an offering of gold and silver and bronze,
c10032	of blue and purple and scarlet yarn, of fine linen and goat hair,
c10033	of ram skins dyed red, fine leather, and acacia wood,
c10034	of olive oil for the light and spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,
c10035	and of onyx stones and gemstones to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
c10036	Let every skilled craftsman among you come
c10037	and make everything
c10038	that the LORD has commanded:
c10039	the tabernacle with its tent and covering, its clasps and frames, its crossbars, posts, and bases;
c10040	the ark with its poles and mercy seat, and the veil to shield it;
c10041	the table with its poles, all its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence;
c10042	the lampstand for light with its accessories and lamps and oil for the light;
c10043	the altar of incense with its poles; the anointing oil and fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle;
c10044	the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grate,
c10046	its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
c10047	the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the gate of the courtyard;
c10048	the tent pegs for the tabernacle [and] for the courtyard, along with their ropes;
c10049	and the woven garments
c10050	for ministering in the holy [place]—
c10051	both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons
c10052	to serve as priests.”
c10053	Then the entire congregation of the Israelites withdrew from the presence of Moses.
c10054	And everyone ... came
c10055	whose heart stirred him
c10056	and
c10057	whose spirit prompted him
c10058	and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its services, and for the sacred garments.
c10059	both men and women, came
c10060	So all who had willing hearts, ... [and] brought brooches and earrings, rings and necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewelry.
c10061	And they all
c10062	presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD.
c10063	Everyone
c10064	who had blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red, or articles of fine leather
c10065	brought them.
c10066	And all
c10067	who could present an offering of silver or bronze
c10068	brought it as a contribution to the LORD.
c10069	Also, everyone
c10070	who had acacia wood for any part of the service
c10071	brought it.
c10072	Every skilled woman
c10073	spun with her hands
c10074	and brought what she had spun: blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen.
c10075	And all the skilled women
c10076	whose hearts were stirred
c10077	spun the goat hair.
c10078	The leaders brought onyx stones and gemstones to mount on the ephod and breastpiece,
c10079	as well as spices and olive oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
c10080	So all the men and women
c10081	whose hearts prompted them
c10082	brought ... for all the work
c10083	to the LORD ... that ... had commanded
c10084	through Moses ... them to do.
c10085	of the Israelites ... a freewill offering ... the LORD
c10086	Then Moses said to the Israelites,
c10087	“See,
c10088	the LORD has called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
c10089	And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, and ability in all kinds of crafts,
c10090	to make artistic designs
c10091	for working in gold and silver and bronze,
c10092	to cut gemstones
c10093	for mounting,
c10094	and to carve wood
c10095	for work in every artistic craft.
c10097	the ability to teach others.
c10098	And [the LORD] has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,
c10099	He has filled them with skill
c10100	to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and as weavers—
c10101	as artistic designers of every kind of craft.
c10102	So Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person are to carry out
c10103	[who] has given them skill and understanding
c10104	to know
c10105	everything ... how to perform all the work of constructing the sanctuary.”
c10106	commanded by the LORD,
c10107	Then Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person
c10108	whom the LORD had gifted—
c10109	everyone
c10110	whose heart stirred him
c10111	to come ... the work.
c10112	and do
c10113	They received from Moses all the contributions
c10114	that the Israelites had brought to carry out the service ... the sanctuary.
c10115	of constructing
c10116	Meanwhile, the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning,
c10117	so that all the skilled craftsmen ... left
c10118	who were doing all the work on the sanctuary
c10119	their work
c10121	and said to Moses,
c10123	“The people ... more
c10124	are bringing ... than enough for doing the work
c10125	the LORD has commanded
c10126	us to do.”
c10127	After Moses had given an order,
c10128	they sent a proclamation throughout the camp:
c10130	“No man or woman should make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.”
c10131	So the people were restrained
c10132	from bringing more,
c10133	since what they already had ... than enough ... all the work.
c10134	to perform
c10135	was more
c10136	All the skilled craftsmen among the workmen made the ten curtains for the tabernacle. ... of finely spun linen, as well as blue, purple, and scarlet yarn,
c10137	They were made ... with a design of cherubim worked into them.
c10138	The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits,
c10139	and width of each curtain [was] four cubits;
c10140	all the curtains had the same measurements,
c10141	and he joined five of the curtains
c10142	together,
c10143	and the other five he joined
c10144	as well.
c10145	He fashioned loops of blue yarn on the edge of the end curtain in the first set,
c10146	and also on the end curtain in the second set.
c10147	He made fifty loops on the one curtain
c10148	and fifty loops on the end curtain
c10149	of the second set,
c10150	so that the loops lined up opposite one another.
c10151	He also made fifty gold clasps
c10152	to join the curtains
c10153	to each other,
c10155	so that the tabernacle was a single unit.
c10156	He then made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—
c10157	eleven curtains altogether.
c10158	The length of each curtain [was] thirty cubits,
c10159	and the width of each curtain [was] four cubits;
c10160	each of the eleven curtains had the same measurements.
c10161	He joined five of the curtains together,
c10162	and the other six together.
c10163	He made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set,
c10164	and fifty loops on the edge of the end curtain in the second set.
c10165	He also made fifty bronze clasps
c10166	to join the tent together
c10167	as a unit.
c10168	Additionally, he made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red,
c10169	and over that a covering of fine leather.
c10170	Next, he constructed ... frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
c10171	upright
c10172	Each frame [was] ten cubits long
c10173	and a cubit and a half wide.
c10174	Two tenons ... each ... frame.
c10175	were connected to ... other for each
c10176	He made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
c10177	He made the frames for the tabernacle
c10178	[as follows:] twenty frames for the south side,
c10179	[along with] forty silver bases to put under the twenty frames—
c10180	two bases under ... one
c10181	each frame, ... under each tenon.
c10182	For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty frames,
c10183	with their forty silver bases,
c10184	two under
c10185	each frame.
c10186	For the west side of the tabernacle he made six frames.
c10187	He also made two frames for the two back corners of the tabernacle.
c10188	They were joined together from bottom
c10189	to top into a single ring.
c10190	He made both corners in this way.
c10191	So there were eight frames with sixteen silver bases,
c10192	two under each frame.
c10193	He also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
c10194	five for the frames on the other side,
c10195	and five for those at the back of the tabernacle, to the west.
c10196	He made the central crossbar
c10197	to run through the center of the frames, from one end to the other.
c10198	And he overlaid the frames with gold
c10199	and made gold rings
c10200	to hold the crossbars.
c10201	He also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
c10202	Next, he made the veil [of] blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen,
c10203	[with] cherubim skillfully worked [into it].
c10204	He also made four posts of acacia wood for it
c10205	and overlaid them with gold,
c10206	along with gold hooks;
c10207	and he cast four silver bases for the posts.
c10208	For the entrance to the tent, he made a curtain ... with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen,
c10209	embroidered
c10210	together with five posts and their hooks.
c10211	He overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold,
c10212	and their five bases were bronze.
c10213	Bezalel went on to make the ark of acacia wood,
c10214	two and a half cubits long,
c10215	a cubit and a half wide,
c10216	and a cubit and a half high.
c10217	He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out,
c10218	and made a gold molding all around it.
c10219	And he cast four gold rings for its four feet,
c10220	two on one side
c10221	and two on the other.
c10222	Then he made poles of acacia wood
c10223	and overlaid them with gold.
c10224	He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark
c10225	for carrying [it].
c10226	He constructed a mercy seat of pure gold,
c10227	two and a half cubits long
c10228	and a cubit and a half wide.
c10229	He made two cherubim ... of gold
c10230	of hammered ... [at the] ends of the mercy seat,
c10231	one cherub on one end
c10232	and one on the other,
c10233	of the mercy seat ... [all] made from one piece.
c10234	And the cherubim had wings that spread upward.
c10235	and overshadowed the mercy seat with their wings,
c10236	They faced each other ... looking toward
c10237	their faces ... the mercy seat.
c10238	He made the table of acacia wood,
c10239	two cubits long,
c10240	a cubit wide,
c10241	and a cubit and a half high.
c10242	He overlaid it with pure gold
c10243	and made a gold molding all around it.
c10244	He also made a rim around it a handbreadth wide
c10245	and put a gold molding on the rim.
c10246	He cast four gold rings for [the table]
c10247	and fastened [them] to the four corners
c10248	at its four legs.
c10249	The rings were placed next to the frame as holders for the poles
c10250	used to carry the table.
c10251	He made the poles [of] acacia wood
c10252	and overlaid them with gold.
c10253	for carrying the table
c10254	He also made the utensils
c10255	for the table
c10256	its plates and dishes, as well as its bowls and pitchers
c10257	for pouring drink offerings.
c10258	out of pure gold:
c10259	Then he made the lampstand out of pure ... gold,
c10260	hammered
c10261	all of one piece: its base and shaft, its ornamental cups, and its buds and petals.
c10262	Six branches extended from the sides,
c10263	three on one side
c10264	and three on the other.
c10265	There were three cups shaped like almond blossoms on the first branch,
c10266	each with buds and petals,
c10267	three on the next branch,
c10269	and the same for all six branches
c10270	that extended from the lampstand.
c10271	On the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers
c10272	with buds and petals.
c10273	A bud was under the first pair ... from [the lampstand],
c10274	of branches ... a bud under the second pair
c10275	,and a bud under the third pair.
c10277	that extended
c10278	The buds and branches were ... of one piece [with the lampstand],
c10279	all ... which was a single hammered piece of pure gold.
c10280	He also made its seven lamps,
c10281	its wick trimmers, and trays of pure gold.
c10282	He made [the lampstand] and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.
c10283	He made the altar of incense out of acacia wood.
c10284	a cubit long,
c10285	a cubit wide,
c10286	It was square,
c10287	and two cubits high.
c10288	Its horns were of one piece.
c10289	And he overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns.
c10290	Then he made a gold molding all around it.
c10291	He made two gold rings below the molding on opposite sides
c10292	to hold the poles
c10293	used to carry it.
c10294	And he made the poles of acacia wood
c10295	and overlaid them with gold.
c10296	He also made the sacred anointing oil
c10297	and the pure, fragrant incense, [the work] of a perfumer.
c10298	Bezalel constructed the altar of burnt offering from acacia wood.
c10299	five cubits long,
c10300	five cubits wide,
c10301	It was square,
c10302	and three cubits high.
c10303	He made a horn at each of its four corners,
c10304	so that the horns [and altar] were of one piece,
c10305	and he overlaid [the altar] with bronze.
c10306	He made all the altar’s utensils ... its pots, shovels, basins, meat forks, and firepans.
c10307	of bronze—
c10308	He made a grate of bronze mesh for the altar under its ledge, halfway up from the bottom.
c10309	At the four corners of the bronze grate he cast four rings
c10310	as holders for the poles.
c10311	And he made the poles of acacia wood
c10312	and overlaid them with bronze.
c10313	Then he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar
c10314	for carrying it.
c10315	He made [the altar] with boards so that it was hollow.
c10316	Next, he made the bronze basin
c10317	and its stand
c10318	from the mirrors ... served
c10319	of the women who ... at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c10320	Then he constructed the courtyard.
c10321	The south side of the courtyard ... [and had] curtains of finely spun linen,
c10322	was a hundred cubits [long]
c10323	with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases,
c10324	and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
c10325	The north side
c10326	[was also] a hundred cubits [long],
c10327	with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases.
c10328	The hooks and bands of the posts were silver.
c10329	The west side
c10330	[and had] curtains,
c10331	[was] fifty cubits long
c10332	with ten posts
c10333	and ten bases.
c10334	The hooks and bands of the posts were silver.
c10335	And the east side, toward the sunrise,
c10336	[was also] fifty cubits [long].
c10337	The curtains of the one side [of the entrance were] fifteen cubits [long],
c10338	with three posts
c10339	and three bases.
c10340	And the curtains for the other side ... [as well].
c10341	were also fifteen cubits long,
c10342	with three posts
c10343	and three bases
c10344	All the curtains around the courtyard were made of finely spun linen.
c10345	The bases for the posts were bronze,
c10346	the hooks and bands were silver,
c10347	and the plating for the tops of the posts was silver.
c10348	So all the posts of the courtyard were banded with silver.
c10349	The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen.
c10350	[It was] twenty cubits long
c10351	and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits high,
c10352	with four posts and four bronze bases.
c10353	Their hooks were silver,
c10354	as well as the bands and the plating of their tops.
c10355	All the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the surrounding courtyard were bronze.
c10356	This is the inventory for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony,
c10357	as recorded at Moses’ command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
c10358	Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything
c10359	that the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10360	With him [was] Aholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, designer, and embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen.
c10361	All the gold
c10362	used for the work on the sanctuary
c10363	from the wave offering ... totaled 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
c10364	The silver from those numbered among the congregation totaled 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel—
c10365	a beka per person,
c10366	[that is], half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel,
c10367	from everyone
c10368	twenty years of age or older who had crossed over to be numbered,
c10369	a total of 603,550 men.
c10370	The hundred talents of silver were
c10371	used to cast the bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the curtain—
c10372	100 bases from the 100 talents,
c10373	one talent per base.
c10374	With the 1,775 [shekels of silver], he made the hooks for the posts,
c10375	overlaid their tops,
c10376	and supplied bands for them.
c10377	The bronze from the wave offering totaled 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.
c10378	He used it to make the bases for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar and its bronze grating,
c10380	all the utensils for the altar,
c10381	the bases for the surrounding courtyard [and] the gate of the courtyard, and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and the surrounding courtyard.
c10382	From the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn [the craftsmen] made specially woven garments
c10383	for ministry in the sanctuary,
c10384	as well as the holy garments
c10385	for Aaron, just as
c10386	the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10387	Bezalel made the ephod out of gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen.
c10388	They hammered out thin sheets of gold
c10389	and cut threads from them
c10390	to interweave with the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen—
c10391	the work of a skilled craftsman.
c10392	They made shoulder pieces for [the ephod],
c10393	which were joined
c10394	to two of its corners for fastening it.
c10395	And the skillfully woven waistband ... the ephod
c10396	of
c10397	was of one piece with the ephod, with the same
c10398	workmanship
c10399	of gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen,
c10400	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10401	They mounted the onyx stones
c10402	in gold filigree settings,
c10403	engraved like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel,
c10404	and fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod
c10405	as memorial stones for the sons of Israel,
c10406	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10407	He also made the breastpiece ... using the work of a skilled
c10408	of gold like the ephod, ... craftsman, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen.
c10409	was square
c10410	[It] ... and folded over double,
c10411	a span long
c10412	and a span wide.
c10414	And they mounted on it four rows of gemstones.
c10415	row [had] a ruby, a topaz, and an emerald;
c10416	The first
c10417	the second row [had] a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;
c10418	the third row [had] a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
c10419	and the fourth row [had] a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper.
c10420	These were mounted in gold filigree settings.
c10421	stones
c10422	corresponded to the names of the sons of Israel. ... with
c10423	The twelve ... one of the names
c10424	Each stone was engraved like a seal ... of the twelve tribes.
c10425	For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold cord.
c10426	They also fashioned two gold filigree settings and two gold rings,
c10427	and fastened the two rings to its two corners.
c10428	Then they fastened the two gold chains to the two gold rings at the corners of the breastpiece,
c10429	and they fastened the other ends of the two chains to the two filigree settings,
c10430	attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
c10431	They made two other gold rings
c10432	and put them at the two other corners of the breastpiece, on ... edge
c10433	the inside ... next to the ephod.
c10434	They made two more gold rings
c10435	and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, near the seam just above the woven waistband of the ephod.
c10436	Then they tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with a cord of blue yarn,
c10437	was above the waistband of the ephod
c10438	so that the breastpiece ... and would not come loose from the ephod,
c10439	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10440	They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth, the work of a weaver,
c10441	with an opening in the center of the robe like that of a garment,
c10442	with a collar around the opening
c10443	so that it would not tear.
c10444	They made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn ... on the lower hem of the robe.
c10445	and finely spun linen
c10446	They also made bells of pure gold
c10447	and attached [them] around the hem between the pomegranates,
c10448	alternating bells and pomegranates around the lower hem of the robe
c10449	to be worn for ministry,
c10450	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10451	For Aaron and his sons they made tunics of fine linen, the work of a weaver,
c10452	as well as the turban of fine linen,
c10453	the ornate headbands
c10454	and undergarments [of] finely spun linen,
c10455	and the sash of finely spun linen, embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn,
c10456	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10457	They also made the plate of the holy crown [of] pure gold,
c10458	and they engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal:
c10459	HOLY TO THE LORD.
c10460	Then they fastened to it a cord of blue yarn
c10461	it in order to mount it to the turban,
c10462	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10463	So all the work for the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, was completed.
c10464	The Israelites did everything
c10465	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10467	Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent with all its furnishings, its clasps, its frames, its crossbars, and its posts and bases;
c10468	the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of fine leather, and the veil of the covering;
c10469	the Ark of the Testimony with its poles and the mercy seat;
c10470	the table with all its utensils and the Bread of the Presence;
c10471	the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its utensils, as well as the oil for the light;
c10472	the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent;
c10473	the bronze altar with its bronze grating,
c10475	its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
c10476	the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, the curtain for the gate of the courtyard, its ropes and tent pegs, and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting;
c10477	and the woven garments
c10478	for ministering in the sanctuary,
c10479	both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons
c10480	to serve as priests.
c10481	all
c10482	the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10483	The Israelites had done ... the work just as
c10484	And Moses inspected all the work
c10485	and saw that
c10486	they had accomplished it
c10487	just as the LORD had commanded.
c10489	So Moses blessed them.
c10490	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c10492	“On the first day of the first month you are to set up the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting.
c10493	Put the Ark of the Testimony in it
c10494	and screen off the ark with the veil.
c10495	Then bring in the table
c10496	and set out its arrangement;
c10497	bring in the lampstand {as well},
c10498	and set up its lamps.
c10499	Place the gold altar of incense in front of the Ark of the Testimony,
c10500	and hang the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
c10501	Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting.
c10502	And place the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar,
c10503	and put water in it.
c10504	Set up the surrounding courtyard
c10505	and hang the curtain for the entrance of the courtyard.
c10506	Take the anointing oil
c10507	and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it;
c10509	consecrate it along with all its furnishings,
c10510	and it shall be holy.
c10511	Anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils;
c10512	consecrate the altar
c10513	and it shall be most holy.
c10514	Anoint the basin and its stand
c10515	and consecrate them.
c10516	Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting
c10517	and wash them with water.
c10518	And you are to clothe Aaron with the holy garments,
c10519	anoint him,
c10520	and consecrate him,
c10521	so that he may serve Me as a priest.
c10522	Bring his sons forward
c10523	and clothe them with tunics.
c10524	Anoint them
c10525	just as you anointed their father,
c10526	so that they may also serve Me as priests.
c10527	will qualify
c10528	Their anointing ... them for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.”
c10529	Moses did
c10530	everything
c10531	just as the LORD had commanded him.
c10533	So
c10534	the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month of the second year.
c10535	When Moses set up the tabernacle,
c10536	he laid its bases,
c10537	positioned its frames,
c10538	inserted its crossbars,
c10539	and set up its posts.
c10540	Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle
c10541	and put the covering over the tent,
c10542	just as the LORD had commanded [him].
c10543	Moses took
c10544	the Testimony and placed it in the ark,
c10545	attaching the poles to the ark;
c10546	and he set the mercy seat atop the ark.
c10547	Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle,
c10548	put up the veil for the screen,
c10549	and shielded off the Ark of the Testimony,
c10550	just as the LORD had commanded him.
c10551	Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil.
c10552	He arranged the bread on it before the LORD,
c10553	just as the LORD had commanded him.
c10554	He also placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
c10555	and set up the lamps before the LORD,
c10556	just as the LORD had commanded him.
c10557	Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting, in front of the veil,
c10558	and he burned fragrant incense on it,
c10559	just as the LORD had commanded him.
c10560	Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
c10561	He placed the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting,
c10562	and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering,
c10563	just as the LORD had commanded him.
c10564	He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar
c10565	and put water in it
c10566	for washing;
c10567	and from it Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet.
c10568	whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting
c10569	or approached the altar,
c10570	They washed
c10571	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10572	Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar,
c10573	and he hung the curtain for the entrance of the courtyard.
c10574	So Moses finished the work.
c10575	Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting,
c10576	and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
c10577	Moses was unable
c10578	to enter the Tent of Meeting
c10579	because the cloud had settled on it,
c10580	and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
c10582	Whenever the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle,
c10583	the Israelites would set out through all the stages of their journey.
c10584	If the cloud was not lifted,
c10585	they would not set out until the day
c10586	it was taken up.
c10587	For the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day,
c10588	and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel through all their journeys.
c10589	called to Moses ... to him
c10590	Then the LORD ... and spoke ... from the Tent of Meeting,
c10591	saying,
c10592	“Speak to the Israelites
c10593	and tell them,
c10594	any
c10595	‘When ... of you brings an offering to the LORD,
c10596	you may bring as your offering an animal from the herd or the flock.
c10597	If [one’s] offering is a burnt offering from the herd,
c10598	an unblemished male.
c10599	he is to offer
c10600	He must bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting for its acceptance before the LORD.
c10601	He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering,
c10602	so it can be accepted on his behalf
c10603	to make atonement for him.
c10604	And he shall slaughter the bull before the LORD, ... sons
c10605	and Aaron’s ... the priests are to present the blood
c10606	and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar
c10607	that is at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c10608	Next, he is to skin the burnt offering
c10609	and cut it into pieces.
c10610	The sons of Aaron the priest shall prepare a fire on the altar
c10611	and arrange wood on the fire.
c10612	Then Aaron’s sons the priests are to arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, atop ... wood
c10613	the burning ... on
c10614	the altar.
c10615	The entrails and legs must be washed with water,
c10616	and the priest shall burn all of it on the altar
c10617	as a burnt offering,
c10618	an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c10619	If, however, one’s offering is a burnt offering from the flock— from the sheep or goats—
c10620	an unblemished male.
c10621	he is to present
c10622	He shall slaughter it on the north side of the altar before the LORD,
c10623	and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood against the altar on all sides.
c10624	He is to cut the animal into pieces, ... with its head and fat,
c10625	and the priest shall arrange them, ... atop ... wood
c10626	the burning ... that [is] on
c10627	the altar.
c10628	The entrails and legs must be washed with water,
c10629	and the priest shall bring all of it
c10630	and burn [it] on the altar;
c10631	it is a burnt offering,
c10632	an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c10633	If, instead, one’s offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds,
c10634	he is to offer a turtledove or a young pigeon.
c10635	Then the priest shall bring it to the altar,
c10636	twist off its head,
c10637	and burn it on the altar;
c10638	its blood should be drained out on the side of the altar.
c10639	Then [the priest] is to remove the crop with its contents
c10640	and throw it to the east side of the altar, in the place for ashes.
c10641	He shall tear it open by its wings
c10642	without dividing the bird,
c10643	[and] burn it on the altar, atop ... wood.
c10644	the burning
c10645	It is a burnt offering,
c10646	an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c10647	anyone
c10648	When ... brings a grain offering to the LORD,
c10649	his offering must consist of fine flour.
c10650	He is to pour olive oil on it,
c10651	put frankincense on it,
c10652	and bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests.
c10653	shall take a handful of the flour and oil, together with all the frankincense,
c10654	The priest ... and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar,
c10655	an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c10656	The remainder of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons;
c10657	it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
c10658	Now if you bring an offering of grain baked in an oven,
c10659	it must consist of fine flour, ... cakes
c10660	either unleavened
c10661	mixed with oil
c10662	or unleavened wafers
c10663	coated with oil.
c10664	If your offering is a grain offering prepared on a griddle,
c10665	made of fine flour
c10666	mixed with oil.
c10667	it must be unleavened bread
c10668	Crumble it
c10669	and pour oil on it;
c10670	it is a grain offering.
c10671	If your offering is a grain offering cooked in a pan,
c10672	it must consist of fine flour with oil.
c10673	When you bring ... the grain offering
c10674	made in any of these ways,
c10675	to the LORD
c10676	it is to be presented to the priest,
c10677	and he shall take it to the altar.
c10678	The priest is to remove the memorial portion from the grain offering
c10679	and burn it on the altar
c10680	as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c10681	But the remainder of the grain offering shall belong to Aaron and his sons;
c10682	it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
c10683	No grain offering
c10684	that you present to the LORD
c10685	may be made with yeast,
c10686	for ... any yeast or honey
c10687	you are not to burn ... as an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c10688	as an offering of firstfruits,
c10689	You may bring them to the LORD
c10690	but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma.
c10691	And you shall season each of your grain offerings with salt;
c10692	you must not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offering—
c10693	you are to add salt to each of your offerings.
c10694	If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD,
c10695	heads of new grain
c10696	roasted on the fire.
c10697	you shall offer crushed
c10698	And you are to put oil ... on it;
c10699	and frankincense
c10700	it is a grain offering.
c10701	The priest shall then burn the memorial portion of the crushed grain and the oil, together with all its incense,
c10702	as an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c10703	If one’s offering [is] a peace offering
c10704	and he offers an animal from the herd, whether
c10705	male or
c10706	female,
c10707	he must present it without blemish before the LORD.
c10708	He is to lay his hand on the head of the offering
c10709	and slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c10710	Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood on all sides of the altar.
c10711	From the peace offering, he is to bring an offering made by fire to the LORD: the fat
c10712	surrounding the entrails,
c10713	all the fat
c10714	that is on the entrails,
c10715	both kidneys with the fat
c10716	on them
c10717	near the loins,
c10718	and the lobe of the liver, which he shall also remove with the kidneys.
c10719	Then Aaron’s sons are to burn it on the altar atop the burnt offering
c10720	that is on ... wood,
c10721	the burning
c10722	as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c10723	If, however, one’s peace offering to the LORD is from the flock, ... a male or female
c10724	he must present ... without blemish.
c10725	If he is presenting a lamb for his offering,
c10726	he must present it before the LORD.
c10727	He is to lay his hand on the head of his offering
c10728	and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting.
c10729	Then Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
c10730	And from the peace offering he shall bring an offering made by fire to the LORD consisting of its fat: the entire fat tail
c10731	cut off close to the backbone,
c10732	the fat
c10733	surrounding the entrails,
c10734	all the fat
c10735	on the entrails,
c10736	both kidneys with the fat
c10737	on them
c10738	near the loins,
c10739	and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.
c10740	Then the priest is to burn them on the altar
c10741	as food, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c10742	If one’s offering is a goat,
c10743	he is to present it before the LORD.
c10744	He must lay his hand on its head
c10745	and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting.
c10746	Then Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
c10747	And from his offering he shall present an offering made by fire to the LORD:
c10748	the fat
c10749	surrounding the entrails,
c10750	all the fat
c10751	that is on [them],
c10752	both kidneys with the fat
c10753	on them
c10754	near the loins,
c10755	and the lobe of the liver, ... with the kidneys.
c10756	which he will also remove
c10757	Then the priest will burn ... on the altar
c10758	the food ... as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma.
c10759	All the fat [is] the LORD’s.
c10760	This is a perpetual statute for the generations to come, wherever you live:
c10761	You must not eat any fat or any blood.’”
c10762	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c10764	“Tell the sons of Israel
c10765	to
c10766	with one
c10767	do as follows ... who sins unintentionally against any of the LORD’s commandments
c10768	and does ... forbidden
c10769	what is ... by them:
c10770	If the anointed priest sins,
c10771	bringing guilt on the people,
c10772	he must bring ... as a sin offering for
c10773	he has committed.
c10774	to the LORD a young bull without blemish ... the sin
c10775	He must bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before the LORD,
c10776	lay his hand on the bull’s head,
c10777	and slaughter it before the LORD.
c10778	Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood
c10779	and bring it into the Tent of Meeting.
c10780	The priest is to dip his finger in the blood
c10781	and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
c10782	The priest must then apply some of the blood to the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the LORD
c10783	in the Tent of Meeting.
c10784	And he is to pour out the rest of the bull’s blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering
c10785	at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c10786	Then he shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering: the fat
c10787	that covers the entrails, ... is on
c10788	all the fat
c10789	that ... [them],
c10790	both kidneys with the fat
c10791	that [is] on them
c10792	near the loins,
c10793	and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys,
c10794	just as the fat is removed from the ox of the peace offering.
c10795	The priest shall then burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
c10796	But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, with its head and legs and its entrails and dung—
c10797	all the rest of the bull— he must take outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place, where the ashes are poured out,
c10798	and he must burn it on a wood fire
c10799	on the ash heap.
c10800	Now if the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally
c10801	and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly
c10802	so that they violate any of the LORD’s commandments
c10803	by doing what is forbidden,
c10804	and incur guilt
c10805	when they become aware of the sin
c10806	they have committed,
c10807	then the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering
c10808	and present it before the Tent of Meeting.
c10809	The elders of the congregation are to lay their hands on the bull’s head before the LORD,
c10810	and it shall be slaughtered before the LORD.
c10811	Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the bull’s blood into the Tent of Meeting,
c10812	and [he] is to dip his finger in the blood
c10813	and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil.
c10814	He is also to apply some of the blood to the horns of the altar
c10815	that is before the LORD
c10816	in the Tent of Meeting,
c10817	and he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering
c10818	at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c10819	And he is to remove all the fat from it
c10820	and burn [it] on the altar.
c10821	He shall offer this bull
c10822	just as he did the bull for the sin offering;
c10823	in this way
c10824	the priest will make atonement on their behalf,
c10825	and they will be forgiven.
c10826	Then he is to take the bull outside the camp
c10827	and burn it,
c10828	just as he burned the first bull.
c10829	It is the sin offering for the assembly.
c10830	When a leader sins
c10831	and does ... by any of the commandments of the LORD his God,
c10832	what is prohibited
c10833	unintentionally
c10834	he incurs guilt.
c10835	When he becomes aware of the sin
c10836	he has committed,
c10837	he must bring an unblemished male goat as his offering.
c10838	He is to lay his hand on the head of the goat
c10839	and slaughter it at the place
c10840	where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD.
c10841	It is a sin offering.
c10842	Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger,
c10843	apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
c10844	and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
c10845	He must burn all its fat on the altar, like the fat of the peace offerings;
c10846	thus the priest will make atonement for that man’s sin,
c10847	and he will be forgiven.
c10848	And if one of the common people sins unintentionally
c10849	by any of the LORD’s commandments,
c10850	and does what is prohibited
c10851	he incurs guilt.
c10852	When he becomes aware of the sin
c10853	he has committed, ... that
c10854	he is to bring a female goat without blemish as his offering for the sin
c10855	he has committed.
c10856	He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering
c10857	and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering.
c10858	Then the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger
c10859	and apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering
c10860	and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
c10861	And he shall remove all the fat
c10862	just as [it] is removed from the peace offering,
c10863	and the priest is to burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c10864	In this way the priest will make atonement for him,
c10865	and he will be forgiven.
c10866	If, however, he brings a lamb as a sin offering,
c10867	he is to bring an unblemished female.
c10868	And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering
c10869	and slaughter it as a sin offering at the place
c10870	where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
c10871	Then the priest must take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger,
c10872	apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
c10873	and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
c10874	[The priest] is to remove all the fat,
c10875	just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the peace offerings,
c10876	and [he] shall burn it on the altar along with the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
c10877	In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin
c10878	he has committed,
c10879	and he will be forgiven.
c10880	someone
c10881	If ... sins
c10882	when he hears a public charge
c10883	about something he has witnessed,
c10884	whether he has seen it
c10885	or learned of it,
c10886	by failing to testify
c10887	he shall bear the iniquity.
c10888	Or if a person
c10889	touches anything unclean— whether the carcass of an unclean wild animal or livestock or crawling creature—
c10890	even if he is unaware of it,
c10891	he is unclean
c10892	and guilty.
c10893	Or if he touches human uncleanness— anything
c10894	by which one becomes unclean—
c10895	even if he is unaware of it,
c10896	when he realizes it,
c10897	he is guilty.
c10898	Or ... someone
c10899	if ... swears
c10900	thoughtlessly with his lips
c10901	evil—
c10902	to do anything good or
c10903	in
c10904	whatever matter a man may rashly pronounce an oath—
c10905	even if he is unaware of it,
c10906	when he later realizes it,
c10907	he will be guilty.
c10909	If someone incurs guilt in one of these ways,
c10910	he must confess
c10911	the sin he has committed,
c10912	and he must bring his guilt offering to the LORD for the sin
c10913	he has committed:
c10914	a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering.
c10915	And the priest will make atonement for him concerning his sin.
c10916	If, however, he cannot afford a lamb,
c10917	he may bring ... as restitution
c10918	for his sin
c10919	to the LORD ... two turtledoves or two young pigeons—
c10920	one as a sin offering
c10921	and the other as a burnt offering.
c10922	He is to bring them to the priest,
c10923	present
c10924	the one for the sin offering.
c10925	who shall first
c10926	He is to twist its head at the front of its neck
c10927	without severing it;
c10928	then he is to sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar,
c10930	while the rest of the blood
c10931	is drained out at the base of the altar.
c10932	It [is] a sin offering.
c10933	And [the priest] must prepare the second [bird] as a burnt offering according to the ordinance.
c10934	In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin
c10935	he has committed,
c10936	and he will be forgiven.
c10937	But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
c10938	he may bring
c10940	a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as an offering for his sin.
c10941	He must not put olive oil ... on it,
c10942	or frankincense
c10943	because it is a sin offering.
c10944	He is to bring it to the priest,
c10945	who shall take a handful from it as a memorial portion
c10946	and burn [it] on the altar atop the offerings made by fire to the LORD;
c10947	it is a sin offering.
c10948	In this way the priest will make atonement for him for ... sins
c10949	he has committed,
c10950	any of these
c10951	and he will be forgiven.
c10952	The remainder will belong to the priest, like the grain offering.”
c10953	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c10955	someone
c10956	“If ... acts unfaithfully
c10957	and sins unintentionally against any of the LORD’s holy things,
c10958	he must bring his guilt offering to the LORD: an unblemished ram from the flock,
c10959	of proper value in silver shekels according to the sanctuary shekel;
c10960	it is a guilt offering.
c10962	Regarding any holy thing he has harmed,
c10963	he must make restitution
c10964	by adding a fifth of its value to it
c10965	and giving it to the priest,
c10966	[who] will make atonement on his behalf with the ram as a guilt offering,
c10967	and he will be forgiven.
c10968	If someone
c10969	sins
c10970	and violates any of the LORD’s commandments
c10971	even though he was
c10972	unaware,
c10973	he is still guilty
c10974	and shall bear his punishment.
c10975	He must bring to the priest an unblemished ram of proper value from the flock as a guilt offering.
c10976	Then the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the wrong
c10977	he has committed
c10978	unintentionally,
c10979	and he will be forgiven.
c10980	It is a guilt offering;
c10981	he was certainly guilty before the LORD.”
c10982	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c10984	someone
c10985	“If ... sins
c10986	and acts unfaithfully against the LORD
c10987	by deceiving his neighbor in regard to a deposit or security entrusted to him or stolen, or
c10988	if he extorts his neighbor
c10989	or finds lost property
c10990	and lies about it
c10991	and swears falsely,
c10992	that a man might commit—
c10993	or if he commits any such sin
c10995	once he has sinned
c10996	and becomes guilty,
c10997	he must return ... he has stolen
c10998	what
c10999	or
c11000	taken by extortion,
c11001	or the deposit
c11002	entrusted to him,
c11003	or the lost property
c11004	he found,
c11005	or anything
c11006	else about which he has sworn falsely.
c11007	He must make restitution in full,
c11008	add a fifth of the value,
c11009	to its owner
c11010	and pay it ... on the day
c11011	[he presents] his guilt offering.
c11012	Then he must bring ... his guilt offering to the LORD:
c11013	to the priest ... an unblemished ram of proper value from the flock.
c11014	In this way the priest will make atonement for him before the LORD,
c11015	and he will be forgiven for anything
c11016	he may have done to incur guilt.”
c11017	Again the LORD said to Moses,
c11019	“Command Aaron and his sons,
c11021	‘This is the law of the burnt offering:
c11022	The burnt offering
c11023	is to remain on the hearth of the altar all night, until morning,
c11024	and the fire ... on the altar.
c11025	must be kept burning
c11026	And the priest shall put on his linen robe
c11027	and linen undergarments,
c11028	and he shall remove ... the ashes
c11029	from the altar ... of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed
c11030	and place them beside [it].
c11031	Then he must take off his garments,
c11032	put on other clothes,
c11033	and carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place.
c11034	The fire on the altar shall be kept burning;
c11035	it must not go out.
c11036	Every morning the priest is to add wood to the fire,
c11037	arrange the burnt offering on it,
c11038	and burn the fat portions of the peace offerings on it.
c11039	The fire must be kept burning on the altar continually;
c11040	it must not be extinguished.
c11041	Now this is the law of the grain offering:
c11042	Aaron’s sons shall present it before the LORD, in front of the altar.
c11043	The priest is to remove a handful of fine flour and olive oil, ... from the grain offering,
c11044	together with all the incense
c11046	and burn ... on the altar
c11047	the memorial portion ... as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c11049	the remainder
c11050	Aaron and his sons are to eat
c11051	.It must be eaten as unleavened, in a holy place;
c11052	they are to eat it in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.
c11053	It must not be baked with yeast;
c11054	I have assigned it as their portion of My offerings made by fire.
c11055	It [is] most holy,
c11056	like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
c11057	Any male among the sons of Aaron may eat it.
c11058	This is a permanent portion from the offerings made by fire to the LORD for the generations to come.
c11059	Anything
c11060	that touches them
c11061	shall become holy.”
c11062	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c11064	“This is the offering that Aaron and his sons
c11065	must present to the LORD on the day
c11066	he is anointed:
c11067	a tenth of an ephah of fine flour
c11068	as a regular grain offering,
c11069	half of it in the morning
c11070	and half in the evening.
c11071	It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle;
c11072	you are to bring it well-kneaded
c11073	and present it as a grain offering broken in pieces,
c11074	a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c11075	The priest,
c11076	who is one of Aaron’s sons and will be anointed to take his place,
c11077	is to prepare it.
c11078	As a permanent portion for the LORD,
c11079	it must be completely burned.
c11080	Every grain offering for a priest shall be burned completely;
c11081	it is not to be eaten.”
c11082	And the LORD said to Moses,
c11084	“Tell Aaron and his sons,
c11086	‘This is the law of the sin offering:
c11087	In the place
c11088	where the burnt offering is slaughtered,
c11089	the sin offering shall be killed before the LORD;
c11090	it [is] most holy.
c11091	The priest
c11092	who offers it
c11093	shall eat it;
c11094	it must be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.
c11095	Anything
c11096	that touches its flesh
c11097	will become holy,
c11098	and if any of the blood is spattered on a garment,
c11099	it
c11100	you must wash ... in a holy place.
c11101	The clay pot
c11102	in which [the sin offering] is boiled
c11103	must be broken;
c11104	if it is boiled in a bronze pot,
c11105	it must be scoured
c11106	and rinsed with water.
c11107	Any male among the priests may eat it;
c11108	it [is] most holy.
c11109	sin offering
c11110	if its blood has been brought into the Tent of Meeting
c11111	to make atonement in the Holy Place;
c11112	But no ... may be eaten
c11113	it must be burned.
c11114	Now this is the law of the guilt offering,
c11115	which [is] most holy:
c11116	in the place
c11117	must be slaughtered ... where the burnt offering
c11118	The guilt offering ... is slaughtered,
c11119	and [the priest] shall sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
c11120	And all the fat from it shall be offered: the fat tail, the fat
c11121	that covers the entrails,
c11122	both kidneys with the fat
c11123	on them
c11124	near the loins,
c11125	and the lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.
c11126	The priest shall burn them on the altar
c11127	as an offering made by fire to the LORD;
c11128	it is a guilt offering.
c11129	Every male among the priests may eat of it.
c11130	It must be eaten in a holy place;
c11131	it [is] most holy.
c11132	The guilt offering is like the sin offering;
c11133	the same law applies to both.
c11134	the priest
c11135	who makes atonement with it.
c11136	It belongs to
c11137	As for the priest
c11138	who presents a burnt offering for anyone,
c11139	the hide of [that] offering
c11142	belongs to him.
c11143	Likewise , every grain offering
c11144	that is baked in an oven
c11146	or cooked in a pan or on a griddle
c11147	the priest
c11148	who presents it,
c11149	belongs to
c11150	and every grain offering,
c11151	or mixed with oil,
c11152	whether dry
c11153	to all the sons of Aaron.
c11154	belongs equally
c11155	Now this is the law of the peace offering
c11156	that one may present to the LORD:
c11157	If he offers it as a thanksgiving,
c11158	then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, he must offer unleavened cakes
c11159	mixed with olive oil,
c11160	unleavened wafers
c11161	coated with oil,
c11162	and well-kneaded ... of fine flour
c11163	cakes
c11164	mixed with oil.
c11165	Along ... he is to present an offering with cakes of leavened bread.
c11166	with his peace offering of thanksgiving,
c11167	From the cakes he must present one portion of each offering as a contribution to the LORD.
c11168	the priest
c11169	who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering.
c11170	It belongs to
c11171	The meat of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offering must be eaten on the day he offers it;
c11172	none of it may be left until morning.
c11173	If, however, the sacrifice he offers is a vow or a freewill offering,
c11174	on the day
c11175	he presents his sacrifice,
c11176	it shall be eaten
c11177	on the next day.
c11179	but the remainder
c11180	may be eaten
c11182	But any meat of the sacrifice remaining until the third day
c11183	must be burned up.
c11184	If any of the meat from his peace offering is eaten on the third day,
c11185	it will not be accepted.
c11186	the one who presented it;
c11187	It will not be credited to
c11188	it shall be an abomination,
c11189	and the one
c11190	who eats of it
c11191	shall bear his iniquity.
c11192	Meat
c11193	that touches anything unclean
c11194	must not be eaten;
c11195	it is to be burned up.
c11196	any other meat,
c11197	As for ... anyone who is clean may eat it.
c11198	But if anyone
c11199	who ... eats meat from the peace offering
c11200	that belongs to the LORD,
c11201	is unclean
c11202	that person must be cut off from his people.
c11203	one
c11204	If ... touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any unclean, detestable thing,
c11205	and then eats any of the meat of the peace offering
c11206	that belongs to the LORD,
c11207	that person must be cut off from his people.”
c11208	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c11210	“Speak to the Israelites
c11211	[and] say,
c11212	‘You are not to eat any of the fat of an ox, a sheep, or a goat.
c11213	The fat of an animal found dead or mauled by wild beasts may be used for any other purpose,
c11214	but you must not eat it.
c11215	If anyone
c11216	eats animal fat
c11217	from which an offering made by fire may be presented to the LORD,
c11218	the one ... it must be cut off
c11219	who eats
c11220	from his people.
c11221	You must not eat the blood of any bird or animal in any of your dwellings.
c11222	If anyone
c11223	eats blood,
c11224	that person must be cut off from his people.’”
c11225	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c11227	“Speak to the Israelites
c11228	[and] say,
c11229	‘Anyone who presents a peace offering to the LORD
c11230	must bring [it] as his sacrifice to the LORD.
c11231	With his own hands he is to bring the offerings made by fire to the LORD;
c11232	the fat, together with the breast,
c11233	he shall bring
c11234	the breast
c11235	and wave ... as a wave offering before the LORD.
c11236	The priest is to burn the fat on the altar,
c11237	but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons.
c11238	And you are to give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from your peace offering.
c11239	who presents the blood and fat of the peace offering
c11240	The son of Aaron
c11241	shall have the right thigh as a portion.
c11242	I have taken from the sons of Israel the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution of their peace offerings,
c11243	and I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a permanent portion from the sons of Israel.’”
c11244	This is the portion of the offerings made by fire to the LORD for Aaron and his sons since the day
c11245	they were presented
c11246	to serve the LORD as priests.
c11247	the LORD commanded that this
c11248	be given
c11249	On the day
c11250	they were anointed, ... them
c11251	by the sons of Israel.
c11252	It is a permanent portion for the generations to come.
c11253	This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering, and the peace offering,
c11254	which the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai on the day
c11255	He commanded the Israelites
c11256	to present their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai.
c11257	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c11259	“Take Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull of the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,
c11260	and assemble the whole congregation at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.”
c11261	So Moses did
c11262	as the LORD had commanded him,
c11263	and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c11264	And Moses said to them,
c11265	“This
c11266	is what the LORD has commanded
c11267	to be done.”
c11268	Then Moses presented Aaron and his sons
c11269	and washed them with water.
c11270	He put the tunic on Aaron,
c11271	tied the sash around him,
c11272	clothed him with the robe,
c11273	and put the ephod on him.
c11274	He tied the woven band of the ephod around him
c11275	and fastened it to him.
c11276	Then he put the breastpiece on him
c11277	and placed the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece.
c11278	[Moses] also put the turban on [Aaron’s] head
c11279	and set the gold plate, the holy diadem, on the front of the turban,
c11280	as the LORD had commanded [him].
c11281	Next, Moses took the anointing oil
c11282	and anointed the tabernacle and everything
c11283	in it;
c11284	and so he consecrated them.
c11285	He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times,
c11286	anointing the altar and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand,
c11287	to consecrate them.
c11288	He also poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head
c11289	and anointed him
c11290	to consecrate him.
c11291	Then Moses presented Aaron’s sons,
c11292	put tunics on them,
c11293	tied sashes around them,
c11294	and fastened headbands on them,
c11295	just as the LORD had commanded [him].
c11296	[Moses] then brought the bull near for the sin offering,
c11297	and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
c11298	slaughtered [the bull],
c11299	Moses ... took some of the blood,
c11300	and applied it with his finger to all [four] horns of the altar,
c11301	purifying the altar.
c11302	He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar
c11303	and consecrated it
c11304	so that atonement could be made on it.
c11305	took all the fat
c11306	that was on the entrails,
c11307	the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat,
c11308	Moses also ... and burned [it] on the altar.
c11309	But the bull with its hide, flesh, and dung he burned outside the camp,
c11310	as the LORD had commanded [him].
c11311	Then [Moses] presented the ram for the burnt offering,
c11312	and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
c11313	slaughtered [the ram]
c11314	Moses ... and sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar.
c11315	cut the ram into pieces
c11316	[He] ... and burned the head, the pieces, and the fat.
c11317	He washed the entrails and legs with water
c11318	and burned the entire ram on the altar
c11319	as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma,
c11320	an offering made by fire to the LORD,
c11321	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c11322	After that, [Moses] presented the other ram, ... of ordination,
c11323	the ram ... and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
c11324	slaughtered [the ram]
c11325	Moses ... and took some of its blood
c11326	and put it on Aaron’s right earlobe, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
c11327	also presented Aaron’s sons
c11328	Moses ... and put some of the blood on their right earlobes, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet.
c11329	Then [he] sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar.
c11330	And [Moses] took the fat— the fat tail, all the fat
c11331	that was on the entrails,
c11332	the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with their fat— as well as the right thigh.
c11333	And from the basket of unleavened bread
c11334	that was before the LORD,
c11335	he took one cake of unleavened bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer,
c11336	and he placed them on the fat portions and on the right thigh.
c11337	He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons
c11338	and waved them before the LORD as a wave offering.
c11339	Then Moses took them out of their hands
c11340	and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering.
c11341	This was an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma,
c11342	an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c11343	He also took the breast—
c11344	and waved it before the LORD as a wave offering,
c11345	Moses’ portion of the ordination ram—
c11346	as the LORD had commanded him.
c11347	Moses next took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood
c11348	that was on the altar
c11349	and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and their garments.
c11350	So he consecrated Aaron and his garments, as well as his sons and their garments.
c11351	And Moses said to Aaron and his sons,
c11352	“Boil the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting
c11353	and eat it there with the bread
c11354	that is in the basket of ordination offerings,
c11355	as I commanded,
c11356	saying,
c11357	‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’
c11359	the remainder of the meat and bread.
c11360	Then you must burn up
c11361	You must not go outside the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days
c11362	of your ordination are complete;
c11363	for it will take seven days to ordain you.
c11364	What has been done today
c11365	has been commanded by the LORD
c11367	in order to make atonement on your behalf.
c11368	You must remain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days
c11369	and keep the LORD’s charge
c11370	so that you will not die,
c11371	for this is what I have been commanded.”
c11372	So Aaron and his sons did everything
c11373	the LORD had commanded through Moses.
c11374	On the eighth day
c11375	Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
c11376	He said to Aaron,
c11377	“Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish,
c11378	and present them before the LORD.
c11379	Then speak to the Israelites
c11380	[and] say,
c11381	‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb, both a year old [and] without blemish, for a burnt offering,
c11382	an ox and a ram for a peace offering
c11383	to sacrifice before the LORD,
c11384	and a grain offering
c11385	mixed with oil.
c11386	For today the LORD will appear to you.’”
c11387	So they took
c11388	what Moses had commanded
c11389	to the front of the Tent of Meeting,
c11390	and the whole congregation drew near
c11391	and stood before the LORD.
c11392	And Moses said,
c11393	“This
c11394	is what the LORD has commanded
c11395	you to do,
c11396	so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.”
c11397	Then Moses said to Aaron,
c11398	“Approach the altar
c11399	and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering
c11400	to make atonement for yourself and for the people. ... for them,
c11401	And sacrifice the people’s offering
c11402	to make atonement
c11403	as the LORD has commanded.”
c11404	So Aaron approached the altar
c11405	and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering
c11406	for himself.
c11407	The sons of Aaron brought the blood to him,
c11408	and he dipped his finger in the blood
c11409	and applied it to the horns of the altar.
c11410	And he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
c11411	On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering,
c11412	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c11413	But he burned up the flesh and the hide outside the camp.
c11414	Then [Aaron] slaughtered the burnt offering
c11415	and [his] sons brought him the blood,
c11416	and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar.
c11417	They brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head,
c11418	and he burned them on the altar.
c11419	He washed the entrails and the legs
c11420	and burned [them] atop the burnt offering on the altar.
c11421	Aaron then presented the people’s offering.
c11422	He took the male goat ... sin offering,
c11423	for the people’s
c11424	slaughtered it,
c11425	and offered it for sin like the first one.
c11426	He presented the burnt offering
c11427	and offered it according to the ordinance.
c11428	Next, he presented the grain offering,
c11429	took a handful of it,
c11430	and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering.
c11431	Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram ... peace offering.
c11432	as the people’s
c11433	[His] sons brought him the blood,
c11434	and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar.
c11435	They also brought the fat portions from the ox and the ram— the fat tail, the fat surrounding the entrails, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver—
c11436	and placed these on the breasts.
c11437	Aaron burned the fat portions on the altar,
c11438	but he waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before the LORD,
c11439	as Moses had commanded.
c11440	Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people
c11441	and blessed them.
c11442	he stepped down.
c11443	And having made the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering,
c11444	Moses and Aaron then entered the Tent of Meeting.
c11445	When they came out,
c11446	they blessed the people,
c11447	and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
c11448	Fire came out from the presence of the LORD
c11449	and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar.
c11450	And when all the people saw it,
c11451	they shouted for joy
c11452	and fell facedown.
c11453	Now Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers,
c11454	put fire in them,
c11455	placed incense on them,
c11456	and offered unauthorized fire before the LORD,
c11457	contrary to His command.
c11458	So fire came out from the presence of the LORD
c11459	and devoured them,
c11460	and they died before the LORD.
c11461	Then Moses said to Aaron,
c11462	“This
c11463	is what the LORD meant
c11464	when He said:
c11465	‘To those who come near Me I will show My holiness,
c11466	and in the sight of all the people I will reveal My glory.’”
c11467	But Aaron remained silent.
c11468	Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, ... to them,
c11469	and said
c11470	“Come here;
c11471	carry the bodies of your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary.”
c11472	So they came forward
c11473	and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp,
c11474	as Moses had directed.
c11475	Then Moses said to Aaron
c11476	and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar,
c11477	“Do not let your hair become disheveled
c11478	and do not tear your garments,
c11479	or else you will die,
c11480	and the LORD will be angry with the whole congregation.
c11481	But your brothers, the whole house of Israel, may mourn [on account of] the fire
c11482	that the LORD has ignited.
c11483	You shall not go outside the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
c11484	or you will die,
c11485	for the LORD’s anointing oil is on you.”
c11486	So they did as Moses instructed.
c11487	Then the LORD said to Aaron,
c11489	“You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink
c11490	when you enter the Tent of Meeting,
c11491	or else you will die;
c11492	this is a perpetual statute for the generations to come.
c11493	You must distinguish between the holy and the common, between the clean and the unclean,
c11494	so that you may teach the Israelites all the statutes
c11495	that the LORD has given them through Moses.”
c11496	And Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar,
c11497	“Take the grain offering
c11498	that remains from the offerings made by fire to the LORD
c11499	and eat it without leaven beside the altar,
c11500	because it [is] most holy.
c11501	You shall eat it in a holy place,
c11502	because it is your share and your sons’ share of the offerings made by fire to the LORD;
c11503	for this is what I have been commanded.
c11504	And you and your sons and daughters may eat the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution in a clean place,
c11505	because these portions ... to you and your children
c11506	have been assigned ... from the peace offerings of the sons of Israel.
c11507	They are to bring the thigh of the contribution and the breast of the wave offering, together with the fat portions of the offerings made by fire,
c11508	to wave as a wave offering before the LORD.
c11509	It will belong permanently to you and your children,
c11510	as the LORD has commanded.”
c11511	Later, Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering,
c11512	and behold, it had been burned up.
c11513	He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s surviving sons,
c11514	and asked,
c11515	“Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place?
c11516	For it is most holy;
c11517	it was given to you
c11518	to take away the guilt of the congregation
c11519	by making atonement for them before the LORD.
c11520	Since
c11521	its blood was not brought inside the holy [place],
c11522	you should have eaten it in the sanctuary area,
c11523	as I commanded.”
c11524	But Aaron replied to Moses,
c11525	“Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD.
c11526	Since these things have happened to me,
c11527	if I had eaten the sin offering today,
c11528	would it have been acceptable in the LORD’s sight?”
c11529	When Moses heard this [explanation],
c11530	he was satisfied.
c11531	The LORD spoke again to Moses and Aaron,
c11532	saying,
c11533	“Say to the Israelites,
c11536	‘Of all the beasts ... you may eat
c11537	of the earth,
c11538	any
c11539	hooves
c11540	with split
c11541	and that chews the cud.
c11542	animal
c11544	But of those that chew the cud or have split hooves, you are not to eat the following:
c11545	The camel,
c11546	though it chews the cud,
c11547	does not have a split hoof;
c11548	it is unclean for you.
c11549	The rock badger,
c11550	though it chews the cud,
c11551	does not have a split hoof;
c11552	it is unclean for you.
c11553	The rabbit,
c11554	though it chews the cud,
c11555	does not have a split hoof;
c11556	it is unclean for you.
c11557	And the pig,
c11558	though it ... hoof,
c11559	has a split
c11560	does not chew the cud;
c11561	it [is] unclean for you.
c11562	You must not eat their meat
c11563	or touch their carcasses;
c11564	they are unclean for you.
c11565	Of all [the creatures] ... you may eat
c11566	that [live] in the water,
c11567	any
c11568	whether salt water or fresh water, ... that have fins and scales.
c11570	everything
c11571	in the seas or streams that does not have fins and scales.
c11572	among all the teeming life and creatures in the water
c11574	But the following ... are detestable to you:
c11575	They shall be an abomination to you;
c11576	you must not eat their meat,
c11577	and you must detest their carcasses.
c11578	Everything
c11579	that does not have fins and scales
c11580	in the water
c11581	shall be detestable to you.
c11582	Additionally, you are to detest the following birds,
c11583	and they must not be eaten
c11584	because they are detestable:
c11585	the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture,
c11586	the kite, and any kind of falcon;
c11587	every kind of raven;
c11588	the ostrich, the night hawk, the gull, and any kind of hawk;
c11589	the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,
c11590	the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,
c11591	the stork, and any kind of heron; the hoopoe and the bat.
c11592	All flying insects
c11593	that walk on [all] fours
c11594	are detestable to you.
c11595	However, you may eat the following kinds of winged creatures
c11596	that walk on all fours:
c11597	those having jointed legs above their feet
c11598	for hopping on the ground—
c11600	any kind of locust, katydid, cricket, or grasshopper.
c11601	All other winged creatures
c11602	that have four legs
c11603	are detestable to you.
c11604	These [creatures] will make you unclean.
c11605	Whoever
c11606	touches their carcasses
c11607	will be unclean until evening,
c11608	and whoever
c11609	picks up one of their carcasses
c11610	must wash his clothes,
c11611	and he will be unclean until evening.
c11612	All animals
c11613	that have hooves that are split
c11614	but not completely divided
c11615	and do not chew the cud
c11616	are unclean for you.
c11618	Whoever touches them
c11619	will be unclean.
c11620	All
c11621	the four-footed ... their paws
c11622	animals
c11623	that walk on
c11624	are unclean for you;
c11625	whoever
c11626	touches their carcasses
c11627	will be unclean until evening,
c11629	and anyone who picks up a carcass
c11630	must wash his clothes,
c11631	and he will be unclean until evening.
c11632	They are unclean for you.
c11633	The following creatures ... are unclean for you:
c11634	that move along the ground
c11635	the mole, the mouse, any kind of great lizard,
c11636	the gecko, the monitor lizard, the common lizard, the skink, and the chameleon.
c11637	These [animals] are unclean for you among all the crawling creatures.
c11638	Whoever
c11639	touches them when they are dead
c11640	shall be unclean until evening.
c11641	When
c11642	one of them dies and falls on something,
c11643	it becomes unclean; any article of wood, clothing, leather, sackcloth,
c11644	or any implement
c11645	used for work
c11646	must be rinsed with water
c11647	and will remain unclean until evening;
c11648	then it will be clean.
c11649	a clay pot,
c11650	If any of them falls into
c11651	everything
c11652	in
c11653	it will be unclean;
c11654	you must break [the pot].
c11655	Any ... food
c11656	edible
c11657	coming into contact with water [from that pot]
c11658	will be unclean,
c11659	and anything
c11660	drinkable in such a container
c11661	will be unclean.
c11662	Anything
c11663	upon which one of their carcasses falls
c11664	will be unclean.
c11665	If it is an oven or cooking pot, it must be smashed;
c11666	it is unclean
c11667	and will remain unclean for you.
c11668	Nevertheless, a spring or cistern containing water will remain clean,
c11670	but one who touches a carcass in it
c11671	will be unclean.
c11672	If a carcass falls on any seed for sowing,
c11674	[the seed] is clean;
c11675	but if water has been put on the seed
c11676	and a carcass falls on it,
c11677	it is unclean for you.
c11678	If an animal ... dies,
c11679	that you may eat
c11680	anyone who touches the carcass
c11681	will be unclean until evening.
c11683	Anyone who eats from the carcass
c11684	must wash his clothes
c11685	and will be unclean until evening,
c11687	and anyone who picks up the carcass
c11688	must wash his clothes
c11689	and will be unclean until evening.
c11690	Every creature
c11691	that moves along the ground
c11692	is detestable; it
c11693	must not be eaten.
c11694	any
c11695	along ... it crawls ... its belly
c11696	whether
c11697	on ... or walks ... four
c11698	or
c11699	creature ... more feet;
c11700	that moves ... the ground, ... on
c11701	Do not eat
c11702	for such [creatures] are detestable.
c11703	Do not defile yourselves by any crawling creature;
c11705	do not become unclean
c11706	or defiled by them.
c11707	For I am the LORD your God;
c11708	consecrate yourselves therefore,
c11709	and be holy,
c11710	because I am holy.
c11711	You must not defile yourselves by any creature
c11712	that crawls along the ground.
c11713	For I am the LORD,
c11714	who brought you up out of the land of Egypt
c11715	to be your God;
c11716	therefore be holy,
c11717	because I am holy.
c11718	This is the law regarding animals, birds, all living creatures
c11719	that move in the water,
c11720	and all creatures
c11721	that crawl along the ground.
c11722	You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between animals
c11723	that may be eaten
c11724	and those
c11725	that may not.”
c11726	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c11728	“Say to the Israelites,
c11730	‘A woman who
c11731	becomes pregnant
c11732	and gives birth to a son
c11733	will be unclean for seven days,
c11734	as she is during the days of her menstruation.
c11735	And on the eighth day the flesh of [the boy’s] foreskin is to be circumcised.
c11736	The woman shall continue in purification from her bleeding for thirty-three days.
c11737	She must not touch anything sacred
c11738	or go into the sanctuary
c11739	until the days of her purification are complete.
c11740	if, however, she gives birth to a daughter,
c11741	[the woman] will be unclean for two weeks as she is during menstruation.
c11742	Then she must continue in purification from her bleeding for sixty-six days.
c11744	When the days of her purification are complete, whether for a son or daughter,
c11745	she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering.
c11746	And [the priest] will present them before the LORD
c11747	and make atonement for her;
c11748	and she shall be cleansed from her flow of blood.
c11749	This is the law
c11750	for a woman giving birth, whether to a male or female.
c11751	But if she cannot afford a lamb,
c11752	she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
c11753	one for a burnt offering
c11754	and the other for a sin offering.
c11755	Then the priest will make atonement for her,
c11756	and she will be clean.’”
c11757	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c11759	someone
c11760	“When ... has a swelling or rash or bright spot on his skin ... or
c11761	that could become an infectious skin disease,
c11762	he must be brought to Aaron the priest ... to one of his sons who is a priest.
c11763	The priest is to examine the infection on his skin,
c11764	and if the hair in the infection has turned white
c11765	and the sore appears to be deeper than the skin,
c11766	it is a skin disease.
c11767	After the priest examines him,
c11768	he must pronounce him unclean.
c11769	If, however, the spot on his skin is white
c11770	and does not appear to be deeper than the skin,
c11771	and the hair in it has not turned white,
c11772	the priest shall quarantine the infected person for seven days.
c11773	On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine him,
c11774	and if he sees that the infection is unchanged
c11775	and has not spread on the skin,
c11776	the priest must isolate him for another seven days.
c11777	The priest will examine him again on the seventh day,
c11778	and if
c11779	the sore has faded
c11780	and has not spread on the skin,
c11781	the priest shall pronounce him clean;
c11782	it is a rash.
c11783	The person must wash his clothes
c11784	and be clean.
c11785	But if the rash spreads further on his skin
c11786	after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing,
c11787	he must present himself again to the priest.
c11788	The priest will examine him,
c11789	and if
c11790	the rash has spread on the skin,
c11791	then the priest must pronounce him unclean;
c11792	he has a skin disease.
c11793	a skin disease,
c11794	When anyone develops
c11795	he must be brought to the priest.
c11796	The priest will examine him,
c11797	and if
c11798	there is a white swelling on the skin
c11799	that has turned the hair white,
c11800	and there is raw flesh in the swelling,
c11801	it is a chronic skin disease
c11802	and the priest must pronounce him unclean.
c11803	He need not quarantine him,
c11804	for he is unclean.
c11805	But if the skin disease breaks out all over his skin
c11806	so that it covers all the skin of the infected person from head to foot, as far as the priest can see,
c11807	the priest shall examine him,
c11808	and if the disease has covered his entire body,
c11809	he is to pronounce the infected person clean.
c11810	Since it has all turned white,
c11811	he is clean.
c11812	But whenever
c11813	raw flesh appears on him,
c11814	he will be unclean.
c11815	When the priest sees the raw flesh,
c11816	he must pronounce him unclean.
c11817	The raw flesh
c11818	is unclean; it
c11819	is a skin disease.
c11820	But if the raw flesh changes
c11821	and turns white,
c11822	he must go to the priest.
c11823	The priest will examine him,
c11824	and if
c11825	the infection has turned white,
c11826	the priest is to pronounce the infected person clean;
c11827	then he is clean.
c11829	When a boil appears on someone’s skin
c11830	and it heals,
c11831	and a white swelling or a reddish-white spot develops where the boil was,
c11832	he must present himself to the priest.
c11833	The priest shall examine it,
c11834	and if
c11835	it appears to be beneath the skin
c11836	and the hair in it has turned white,
c11837	the priest shall pronounce him unclean;
c11838	it is a diseased infection
c11839	that has broken out in the boil.
c11840	But when the priest examines it,
c11841	if
c11842	there is no white hair in it,
c11843	and it is not beneath the skin
c11844	and has faded,
c11845	the priest shall isolate him for seven days.
c11846	If it spreads any further on the skin,
c11847	the priest must pronounce him unclean;
c11848	it is an infection.
c11849	But if the spot remains unchanged
c11850	and does not spread,
c11851	it is only the scar from the boil,
c11852	and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
c11853	or
c11854	When there is a burn on someone’s skin
c11855	and the raw [area] of the burn becomes reddish-white ... white,
c11856	the priest must examine it.
c11857	If
c11858	the hair in the spot has turned white
c11859	and the spot appears to be deeper than the skin,
c11860	it is a disease
c11861	that has broken out in the burn.
c11862	The priest must pronounce him unclean;
c11863	it is a diseased infection.
c11864	But if the priest examines it
c11865	and there is
c11866	no white hair in the spot,
c11867	and it is not beneath the skin
c11868	but has faded,
c11869	the priest shall isolate him for seven days.
c11870	On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine him,
c11871	and if it has spread further on the skin,
c11872	the priest must pronounce him unclean;
c11873	it is a diseased infection.
c11874	But if the spot is unchanged
c11875	and has not spread on the skin
c11876	but has faded, it
c11877	is a swelling from the burn, ... it
c11878	and the priest is to pronounce him clean;
c11879	for ... is only the scar from the burn.
c11880	a man or woman
c11881	If ... has an infection on the head or chin,
c11882	the priest shall examine the infection,
c11883	and if
c11884	it appears to be deeper than the skin
c11885	and the hair in it is yellow and thin,
c11886	the priest must pronounce him unclean;
c11887	it is a scaly outbreak,
c11888	an infectious disease of the head or chin.
c11889	But if the priest examines the scaly infection
c11890	and
c11891	it does not appear to be deeper than the skin,
c11892	and there is no black hair in it,
c11893	the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days.
c11894	On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine the infection,
c11895	and if
c11896	the scaly outbreak has not spread
c11897	and there is no yellow hair in it,
c11898	and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin,
c11899	then the person must shave himself
c11900	except for the scaly area.
c11901	Then the priest shall isolate [him] for another seven days.
c11902	On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scaly outbreak,
c11903	and if
c11904	it has not spread on the skin
c11905	appear to be
c11906	and does not ... deeper than the skin,
c11907	the priest is to pronounce him clean.
c11908	He must wash his clothes,
c11909	and he will be clean.
c11910	If, however, the scaly outbreak spreads further on the skin after his cleansing,
c11911	the priest is to examine him,
c11912	and if
c11913	the scaly outbreak has spread on the skin,
c11914	the priest need not look for yellow hair;
c11915	the person is unclean.
c11916	But if in his sight the scaly outbreak is unchanged
c11917	and black hair has grown in it,
c11918	then it has healed.
c11919	He is clean,
c11920	and the priest is to pronounce him [clean].
c11921	a man or a woman
c11922	When ... has white spots on the skin,
c11923	the priest shall examine them,
c11924	and if
c11925	the spots are dull white,
c11926	it is a harmless rash
c11927	that has broken out on the skin;
c11928	the person is clean.
c11929	a man
c11930	Now if ... loses his hair
c11931	[and] is bald,
c11932	he is still clean.
c11933	Or if his hairline recedes
c11934	and he is bald on his forehead,
c11935	he is still clean.
c11936	But if there is a reddish-white sore on the bald head or forehead,
c11937	it is an infectious disease breaking out [on it].
c11938	The priest is to examine him,
c11939	and if the swelling of the infection on his bald head or forehead is reddish-white
c11940	like a skin disease,
c11941	the man is diseased; he
c11942	is unclean.
c11943	The priest must pronounce him unclean
c11944	because of the infection on his head.
c11946	The diseased person
c11947	must wear torn clothes
c11948	and let his hair hang loose,
c11949	and he must cover his mouth
c11951	‘Unclean, unclean!’
c11952	and cry out,
c11953	As long as
c11954	he has the infection,
c11955	he remains
c11956	unclean.
c11957	He must live alone
c11958	in a place outside the camp.
c11959	any fabric
c11960	If ... is contaminated with mildew—
c11961	any wool or linen garment,
c11962	any weave or knit of linen or wool, or any article of leather—
c11963	and if the mark in the fabric, leather, weave, knit, or leather article is green or red,
c11964	then it is contaminated with mildew
c11965	and must be shown to the priest.
c11966	And the priest is to examine the mildew
c11967	and isolate the contaminated [fabric] for seven days.
c11968	On the seventh day the priest shall reexamine it, ... the mildew
c11969	and if ... has spread in the fabric, weave, knit, or leather, then regardless of
c11970	how it is used,
c11971	[it] is a harmful mildew;
c11972	[the article] is unclean.
c11973	He is to burn the fabric, weave, or knit, whether ... wool or linen or leather.
c11974	the contaminated item [is]
c11975	Since the mildew is harmful, [the article]
c11976	must be burned up.
c11977	But when the priest examines it,
c11978	if
c11979	the mildew has not spread in the garment, weave, knit, or leather article,
c11980	the priest is to order
c11981	to be washed
c11982	the contaminated [article]
c11983	and isolated for another seven days.
c11984	the priest is to reexamine it,
c11985	After it has been washed,
c11986	the mildewed
c11987	and if
c11988	article has not changed in appearance,
c11989	Even though the mildew has not spread,
c11990	it is unclean.
c11991	you must burn up the fabric,
c11992	whether the rot is on the front or back.
c11993	If the priest examines it
c11995	and the mildew has faded
c11996	after it has been washed,
c11997	he must cut the contaminated section out of the fabric, leather, weave, or knit.
c11998	But if it reappears in the fabric, weave or knit, or on any leather article,
c11999	it is spreading.
c12000	You must burn up
c12001	the contaminated article.
c12002	the fabric, weave or knit, or any leather article
c12003	after washing,
c12004	If the mildew disappears from
c12005	then it is to be washed again,
c12006	and it will be clean.
c12007	This is the law concerning a mildew contamination in wool or linen fabric, weave or knit, or any leather article, ... or
c12008	for pronouncing it clean
c12009	unclean.”
c12010	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c12012	“This is the law of the one afflicted with a skin disease on the day of his cleansing,
c12013	when he is brought to the priest.
c12014	The priest is to go outside the camp
c12015	to examine him,
c12016	and if the skin disease of the afflicted person has healed,
c12017	the priest shall order
c12018	that two live clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop be brought for the one to be cleansed.
c12019	Then the priest shall command
c12020	that one of the birds be slaughtered over fresh water in a clay pot.
c12021	the live bird
c12022	And he is to take ... together with the cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop,
c12023	and dip them into the blood of the bird ... the fresh
c12024	that was slaughtered over ... water.
c12025	he shall sprinkle
c12026	the one to be cleansed of the skin disease.
c12027	Seven times
c12028	Then he shall pronounce him clean
c12029	and release the live bird into the open field.
c12030	The one being cleansed must wash his clothes,
c12031	shave off all his hair,
c12032	and bathe with water,
c12033	that he may be clean.
c12034	Afterward, he may enter the camp,
c12035	but he must remain outside his tent for seven days.
c12036	On the seventh day
c12037	he must shave off all his hair— his head, his beard, his eyebrows,
c12038	and the rest of his hair.
c12039	He must wash his clothes
c12040	and bathe himself with water,
c12041	and he will be clean.
c12042	On the eighth day he is to bring two unblemished male lambs, an unblemished ewe lamb a year old, a grain offering of three-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour
c12043	mixed with olive oil,
c12044	and one log of olive oil.
c12045	The priest who performs the cleansing shall present the one to be cleansed, together with these offerings, before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c12046	Then the priest is to take one of the male lambs
c12047	and present it as a guilt offering, along with the log of olive oil;
c12048	and he must wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
c12049	Then he is to slaughter the lamb ... place
c12050	the sin offering and burnt offering are slaughtered.
c12051	in the holy ... where
c12052	Like the sin offering, the guilt offering
c12053	belongs to the priest; it
c12054	[is] most holy.
c12055	The priest is to take [some] of the blood from the guilt offering
c12056	and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
c12057	Then the priest shall take [some] of the log of olive oil,
c12058	pour it into his left palm,
c12059	dip his right forefinger into the oil
c12060	in his left palm,
c12061	and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.
c12062	of the oil remaining
c12063	in his palm
c12064	And the priest is to put some ... on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering.
c12066	The rest of the oil
c12067	in his palm, the priest
c12068	is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed,
c12069	to make atonement for him before the LORD.
c12070	Then the priest is to sacrifice the sin offering
c12071	and make atonement
c12072	for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness.
c12073	After that, [the priest] shall slaughter the burnt offering
c12074	and offer [it] on the altar, with the grain offering,
c12075	to make atonement for him,
c12076	and he will be clean.
c12077	If, however, [the person] is poor
c12078	and cannot afford these [offerings],
c12079	he is to take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved
c12080	to make atonement for him,
c12081	along with a tenth [an ephah] of fine flour
c12082	mixed with olive oil
c12083	for a grain offering,
c12084	a log of olive oil,
c12085	and two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
c12086	whichever he can afford,
c12087	one to be a sin offering
c12088	and the other a burnt offering.
c12089	On the eighth day he is to bring them for his cleansing to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD.
c12090	The priest shall take the lamb for the guilt offering, along with the log of olive oil,
c12091	and wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
c12092	And after he slaughters the lamb for the guilt offering,
c12093	the priest is to take [some] of the blood of the guilt offering
c12094	and put it on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
c12095	Then the priest is to pour some of the oil into his left palm
c12096	and sprinkle with his right forefinger some of the oil
c12097	in his left palm
c12098	seven times before the LORD.
c12099	The priest shall also put some of the oil
c12100	in his palm
c12101	on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot— on the same places as the blood of the guilt offering.
c12103	The rest of the oil
c12104	in his palm, the priest
c12105	is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed,
c12106	to make atonement for him before the LORD.
c12107	Then he must sacrifice one of the turtledoves or young pigeons,
c12108	whichever he can afford,
c12110	one as a sin offering
c12111	and the other as a burnt offering, together with the grain offering.
c12112	In this way the priest will make atonement before the LORD for the one to be cleansed.
c12113	This is the law
c12114	for someone who has a skin disease
c12115	and cannot afford the cost of his cleansing.”
c12116	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c12118	“When you enter the land of Canaan,
c12119	which I am giving you as your possession,
c12120	and I put a contamination of mildew into a house in that land,
c12121	shall come
c12122	the owner of the house
c12123	and tell the priest,
c12125	‘Something like mildew has appeared in my house.’
c12126	The priest must order that
c12127	the house be cleared
c12128	before he enters it
c12129	to examine the mildew,
c12130	lest everything ... becomes unclean.
c12131	in the house
c12132	After this, the priest shall go in
c12133	to inspect the house.
c12134	He is to examine [the house],
c12135	and if the mildew on the walls consists of green or red depressions
c12136	that appear to be beneath the surface of the wall,
c12137	the priest shall go outside the doorway of the house
c12138	and close [it] up for seven days.
c12139	On the seventh day the priest is to return
c12140	and inspect [the house].
c12141	If the mildew has spread on the walls,
c12142	[he] must order
c12143	stones be pulled out
c12144	that the contaminated
c12145	and thrown into an unclean place outside the city.
c12146	And he shall order the inside of the house completely scraped,
c12147	and the plaster ... must be dumped
c12148	that is scraped off
c12149	into an unclean place outside the city.
c12150	So different stones must be obtained
c12151	to replace the [contaminated] ones,
c12152	and additional mortar
c12153	to replaster the house.
c12154	If the mildew reappears
c12155	in the house
c12156	after the stones have been torn out
c12157	and the house has been scraped
c12158	and replastered,
c12159	the priest must come
c12160	and inspect it.
c12161	If the mildew has spread in the house,
c12162	it [is] a destructive mildew; the house
c12163	is unclean.
c12164	It must be torn down with its stones, its timbers, and all its plaster,
c12165	and taken outside the city to an unclean place.
c12167	Anyone who enters the house during any of the days
c12168	that it is closed up
c12169	will be unclean until evening.
c12171	And anyone who sleeps in the house
c12174	or eats in it
c12175	must wash his clothes.
c12176	If, however, the priest comes
c12177	and inspects it,
c12178	and the mildew has not spread
c12179	after the house has been replastered,
c12180	he shall pronounce the house clean,
c12181	because the mildew is gone.
c12182	[The priest] is to take
c12183	to purify the house;
c12184	two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop
c12185	and he shall slaughter one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.
c12186	Then he shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn, and the live bird,
c12187	dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and the fresh water,
c12188	and sprinkle the house seven times.
c12189	And he shall cleanse the house with the bird’s blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet yarn.
c12190	Finally, he is to release the live bird into the open fields outside the city.
c12191	In this way he will make atonement for the house,
c12192	and it will be clean.
c12193	This is the law for any skin disease or mildew, for a scaly outbreak,
c12194	for mildew in clothing or in a house,
c12195	and for a swelling, rash, or spot,
c12196	to determine when something is clean or unclean.
c12197	This is the law regarding skin diseases and mildew.”
c12198	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c12200	“Say to the Israelites,
c12202	any man
c12203	‘When ... has a bodily discharge, the discharge
c12204	is unclean.
c12205	This uncleanness is from his discharge,
c12206	whether his body allows the discharge {to flow}
c12207	or blocks it. So his discharge
c12208	will bring about uncleanness.
c12209	Any bed
c12210	on which the man with the discharge lies
c12211	will be unclean,
c12212	and any furniture
c12213	on which he sits
c12214	will be unclean.
c12215	Anyone
c12216	who touches his bed
c12217	must wash his clothes
c12218	and bathe with water,
c12219	and he will be unclean until evening.
c12221	Whoever sits on furniture
c12222	on which the man with the discharge was sitting
c12223	must wash his clothes
c12224	and bathe with water,
c12225	and he will be unclean until evening.
c12227	Whoever touches the body of the man with a discharge
c12228	must wash his clothes
c12229	and bathe with water,
c12230	and he will be unclean until evening.
c12231	If the man with the discharge spits on one who is clean,
c12232	[that person] must wash his clothes
c12233	and bathe with water,
c12234	and he will be unclean until evening.
c12235	Any saddle
c12236	on which the man with the discharge rides
c12237	will be unclean.
c12238	Whoever
c12239	touches anything
c12240	that was under
c12241	him will be unclean until evening,
c12243	and whoever carries such things
c12244	must wash his clothes
c12245	and bathe with water,
c12246	and he will be unclean until evening.
c12247	anyone
c12248	If the man with the discharge touches
c12249	without first rinsing his hands with water,
c12250	the one who was touched must wash his clothes
c12251	and bathe with water,
c12252	and he will be unclean until evening.
c12253	Any clay pot
c12254	that the man with the discharge touches
c12255	must be broken,
c12256	and any wooden utensil must be rinsed with water.
c12257	When the man has been cleansed from his discharge,
c12258	he must count off seven days for his cleansing,
c12259	wash his clothes,
c12260	and bathe himself in fresh water,
c12261	and he shall be clean.
c12262	On the eighth day he is to take two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
c12263	come before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
c12264	and give them to the priest.
c12265	The priest is to sacrifice them,
c12266	one as a sin offering
c12267	and the other as a burnt offering.
c12268	In this way the priest will make atonement for [the man] before the LORD because of his discharge.
c12269	a man
c12270	When ... has an emission of semen,
c12271	he must bathe his whole body with water,
c12272	and he will be unclean until evening.
c12273	Any clothing or leather
c12274	on which there is an emission of semen
c12275	must be washed with water,
c12276	and it will remain unclean until evening.
c12277	a woman
c12278	If a man lies with ... and there is an emission of semen,
c12279	both must bathe with water,
c12280	and they will remain unclean until evening.
c12281	a woman
c12282	When ... has a discharge ... of blood
c12283	consisting ... from her body,
c12284	for seven days she will be unclean due to menstruation,
c12285	and anyone
c12286	who touches her
c12287	will be unclean until evening.
c12288	Anything
c12289	on which she lies ... during her menstruation
c12290	will be unclean,
c12292	or sits
c12294	and anyone
c12295	who touches her bed
c12296	must wash his clothes
c12297	and bathe with water,
c12298	and he will be unclean until evening.
c12299	And whoever
c12300	touches any furniture
c12301	on which she was sitting
c12302	must wash his clothes
c12303	and bathe with water,
c12304	and he will be unclean until evening,
c12305	and whether it is a bed ... on
c12306	or furniture
c12307	which she was sitting,
c12308	whoever touches it
c12309	will be unclean until evening.
c12310	If a man lies with her
c12311	and her menstrual flow touches him,
c12312	he will be unclean for seven days,
c12313	and any bed
c12314	on which he lies
c12315	will become unclean.
c12316	a woman
c12317	When ... has a discharge of her blood for many days at a time other than her menstrual period,
c12318	or if it continues beyond her period,
c12319	will be ... all the days of her unclean discharge, just as she is during the days of her menstruation.
c12320	she ... unclean
c12321	Any bed
c12322	on which she lies or any ... during the days of her discharge
c12323	like her bed
c12324	furniture
c12325	on which she sits
c12326	will be unclean, ... during her menstrual period.
c12327	Anyone
c12328	who touches these things
c12329	will be unclean;
c12330	he must wash his clothes
c12331	and bathe with water,
c12332	and he will be unclean until evening.
c12333	When [a woman] is cleansed of her discharge,
c12334	she must count off seven days,
c12335	and after that she will be clean.
c12336	On the eighth day she is to take two turtledoves or two young pigeons
c12337	and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c12338	The priest is to sacrifice one as a sin offering
c12339	and the other as a burnt offering.
c12340	In this way the priest will make atonement for her before the LORD for her unclean discharge.
c12341	You must keep the children of Israel {separate} from their uncleanness,
c12342	so that they do not die
c12343	by defiling My tabernacle
c12344	that is among them.
c12345	This is the law of him who has a discharge,
c12346	of the man who has a seminal emission
c12347	whereby he is unclean,
c12348	of a woman in her menstrual period,
c12349	of any male or female who has a discharge,
c12350	and of a man
c12351	who lies with an unclean woman.”
c12352	Now the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of two of Aaron’s sons
c12353	when they approached the presence of the LORD.
c12355	And the LORD said to Moses:
c12356	“Tell your brother Aaron ... into
c12357	not to enter freely ... the Most Holy Place behind the veil in front of the mercy seat
c12358	on the ark,
c12359	or else he will die,
c12360	because I appear in the cloud above the mercy seat.
c12361	This is how Aaron is to enter the Holy Place:
c12362	with a young bull for a sin offering
c12363	and a ram for a burnt offering.
c12364	He is to wear the sacred linen tunic,
c12365	with linen undergarments.
c12366	He must tie a linen sash
c12367	around him and put on the linen turban.
c12368	These [are] sacred garments,
c12369	and he must bathe himself with water
c12370	before he wears them.
c12371	And he shall take from the congregation of the Israelites two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
c12372	Aaron is to present the bull for his sin offering
c12374	and make atonement for himself and his household.
c12375	Then he shall take the two goats
c12376	and present them before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c12377	After Aaron casts lots for the two goats,
c12378	one for the LORD
c12379	and the other for the scapegoat,
c12380	he shall present the goat
c12381	chosen by lot for the LORD
c12382	and sacrifice it as a sin offering.
c12383	But the goat
c12384	chosen by lot to be the scapegoat
c12385	shall be presented alive before the LORD
c12386	to make purification
c12387	by sending it into the wilderness as the scapegoat.
c12388	When Aaron presents the bull for his sin offering
c12390	and makes atonement for himself and his household,
c12391	he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering.
c12393	Then he must take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD,
c12394	and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense,
c12395	and take them inside the veil.
c12396	He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD,
c12397	and the cloud of incense will cover the mercy seat
c12398	above the testimony,
c12399	so that he will not die.
c12400	And he is to take some of the bull’s blood
c12401	and sprinkle it with his finger on the east side of the mercy seat;
c12402	then he shall sprinkle some of [it] with his finger seven times before the mercy seat.
c12403	[Aaron] shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering
c12404	for the people
c12405	and bring its blood behind the veil,
c12406	and with its blood he must do
c12407	as he did with the bull’s blood:
c12408	He is to sprinkle it against the mercy seat
c12409	and in front of it.
c12410	So he shall make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the impurities and rebellious acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins.
c12411	He is to do the same for the Tent of Meeting
c12412	which abides among them, because it is surrounded by their impurities.
c12413	No one may be in the Tent of Meeting
c12414	from the time [Aaron] goes in
c12415	to make atonement
c12416	in the Most Holy Place
c12417	until he leaves,
c12418	after he has made atonement for himself, his household, and the whole assembly of Israel.
c12419	Then he shall go out to the altar
c12420	that is before the LORD
c12421	and make atonement for it.
c12422	He is to take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood
c12423	and put it on all the horns of the altar.
c12424	He is to sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times
c12425	to cleanse it
c12426	and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.
c12427	When [Aaron] has finished
c12428	purifying the Most Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar,
c12429	he is to bring forward the live goat.
c12430	Then [he] is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat
c12431	and confess over it all the iniquities and rebellious acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins.
c12432	He is to put them on the goat’s head
c12433	and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man appointed for the task.
c12434	The goat will carry on itself all their iniquities into a solitary place,
c12435	and [the man] will release [it] into the wilderness.
c12436	Then Aaron is to enter the Tent of Meeting,
c12437	take off the linen garments
c12438	he put on
c12439	before entering the Most Holy Place,
c12440	and leave them there.
c12441	He is to bathe himself with water in a holy place
c12442	and put on his own clothes.
c12443	Then he must go out
c12444	and sacrifice his burnt offering and the people’s burnt offering
c12445	to make atonement for himself and for the people.
c12446	He is also to burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
c12448	The man who released the goat as the scapegoat
c12449	must wash his clothes
c12450	and bathe himself with water;
c12451	afterward he may reenter the camp.
c12452	The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering,
c12453	whose blood was brought
c12454	into the Most Holy Place to make atonement,
c12455	must be taken outside the camp
c12456	and their hides, flesh, and dung must be burned up.
c12458	The one who burns
c12459	them must wash his clothes
c12460	and bathe himself with water,
c12461	and afterward he may reenter the camp.
c12462	This is to be a permanent statute for you:
c12463	On the tenth day of the seventh month, you shall humble your souls
c12464	and not do any work— whether the native or the foreigner
c12465	who resides among you—
c12466	because on this day atonement will be made for you
c12467	to cleanse you,
c12468	and you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
c12469	It is a Sabbath of solemn rest for you,
c12470	that you may humble your souls;
c12471	it is a permanent statute.
c12472	The priest ... shall make atonement.
c12473	who is anointed
c12474	and ordained
c12475	to succeed his father {as high priest}
c12476	He will put on the sacred linen garments
c12477	and make atonement for the Most Holy Place,
c12478	the Tent of Meeting, and the altar,
c12479	and for the priests and all the people of the assembly.
c12480	This is to be a permanent statute for you,
c12481	to make atonement once a year for the Israelites because of all their sins.”
c12482	And all this was done
c12483	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c12484	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c12486	“Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites
c12487	and tell them
c12488	this
c12489	is what the LORD has commanded:
c12491	‘Anyone from the house of Israel
c12492	who slaughters an ox, a lamb, or a goat in the camp
c12493	or outside of [it]
c12494	instead of bringing it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting
c12495	to present it as an offering to the LORD before His tabernacle—
c12496	that man shall incur bloodguilt.
c12497	He has shed blood
c12498	and must be cut off from his people.
c12499	For this reason the Israelites will bring ... the sacrifices
c12500	they have been offering in the open fields.
c12501	to the LORD ... They are to bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting
c12502	and offer them as sacrifices of peace to the LORD.
c12503	The priest will then sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting
c12504	and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c12505	They must no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat demons
c12506	to which they have prostituted themselves.
c12507	This will be a permanent statute for them for the generations to come.’
c12508	Tell them
c12509	that if anyone from the house of Israel or any foreigner
c12510	living among them
c12511	offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice
c12512	but does not bring it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting
c12513	to sacrifice it to the LORD,
c12514	that man must be cut off from among his people.
c12515	If anyone from the house of Israel or foreigner
c12516	living among them
c12517	eats any blood,
c12518	I will set My face against that person
c12520	and cut him off from among his people.
c12521	For the life of a creature
c12522	is in the blood, ... it
c12523	and I have given it to you ... upon the altar,
c12524	to make an atonement for your souls
c12525	since ... is the lifeblood
c12526	that makes atonement.
c12527	Therefore I say to the Israelites,
c12528	‘None of you may eat blood,
c12529	any foreigner
c12530	living among you
c12531	nor may ... eat blood.’
c12532	And if any Israelite or foreigner
c12533	living among them
c12534	hunts down a wild animal or bird
c12535	that may be eaten,
c12536	he must drain its blood
c12537	and cover it with dirt.
c12538	For the life of all flesh
c12539	is its blood.
c12541	Therefore I have told the Israelites:
c12542	You must not eat the blood of any living thing,
c12543	because the life of all flesh
c12544	is its blood;
c12545	whoever
c12546	eats
c12547	it must be cut off.
c12548	And any person,
c12549	who eats anything found dead or mauled by wild beasts
c12550	whether native or foreigner,
c12551	must wash his clothes
c12552	and bathe with water,
c12553	and he will be unclean until evening;
c12554	then he will be clean.
c12555	But if he does not wash
c12556	his clothes and bathe himself,
c12557	then he shall bear his iniquity.”
c12558	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c12560	“Speak to the Israelites
c12561	[and] tell them,
c12562	‘I am the LORD your God.
c12563	the practices of the land of Egypt,
c12564	where you used to live,
c12565	You shall not follow
c12566	the practices of the land of Canaan,
c12567	where I am bringing you.
c12568	[or] ... You must not
c12569	walk in their customs.
c12570	You are to practice My judgments
c12571	and keep My statutes
c12572	by walking in them.
c12573	I am the LORD your God.
c12574	Keep My statutes and My judgments,
c12575	[for] the man who does these things
c12576	will live by them.
c12577	I am the LORD.
c12578	None of
c12579	you are to approach any close relative
c12580	to have sexual relations.
c12581	I am the LORD.
c12582	You must not expose the nakedness of your father by having sexual relations with your mother.
c12583	She is your mother;
c12584	you must not have sexual relations with her.
c12585	You must not have sexual relations with your father’s wife;
c12586	it would dishonor your father.
c12587	your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.
c12588	You must not have sexual relations with
c12589	your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter,
c12590	You must not have sexual relations with ... would shame your family.
c12591	for that
c12592	have sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father;
c12593	she is your sister.
c12594	You must not
c12595	You must not have sexual relations with your father’s sister;
c12596	she is your father’s close relative.
c12597	You must not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister,
c12598	for she is your mother’s close relative.
c12599	You must not dishonor your father’s brother ... to have sexual relations
c12600	by approaching his wife ... with her;
c12601	she [is] your aunt.
c12602	You must not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law.
c12603	She is your son’s wife;
c12604	you are not to have sexual relations with her.
c12605	You must not have sexual relations with your brother’s wife;
c12606	that would shame your brother.
c12607	You must not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter.
c12608	You are not to marry her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter
c12609	and have sexual relations with her.
c12610	They are close relatives;
c12611	it is depraved.
c12612	You must not take your wife’s sister
c12613	as a rival wife
c12614	and have sexual relations with her while your wife is still alive.
c12615	You must not approach a woman ... during her menstrual period.
c12616	to have sexual relations with her
c12617	You must not have sexual relations with your neighbor’s wife
c12618	and thus defile yourself with her.
c12619	You must not give any of your children
c12620	to be sacrificed to Molech,
c12621	for you must not profane the name of your God.
c12622	I am the LORD.
c12623	You must not lie with a man as with a woman;
c12624	that [is] an abomination.
c12625	You must not have sexual relations with any animal,
c12626	thus defiling yourself with it;
c12627	a woman must not stand before an animal
c12628	to mate with it;
c12629	that is a perversion.
c12630	Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices,
c12631	for by all these things the nations ... have defiled themselves.
c12632	I am driving out before you
c12633	Even the land has become defiled,
c12634	so I am punishing it for its sin,
c12635	and the land will vomit out its inhabitants.
c12636	But you are to keep My statutes and ordinances,
c12637	and you must not commit any of these abominations— neither your native-born nor the foreigner
c12638	who lives among you.
c12639	For the men who were in the land ... committed all these abominations,
c12640	before you
c12641	and the land has become defiled.
c12642	the land, it will vomit you out
c12643	So if you defile
c12644	as it spewed out the nations
c12645	before you.
c12646	Therefore anyone
c12647	who commits any of these abominations
c12648	must be cut off
c12650	from among his people.
c12651	You must keep My charge
c12652	not to practice [any] of the abominable customs
c12653	that were practiced before you,
c12654	so that you do not defile yourselves by them.
c12655	I am the LORD your God.”
c12656	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c12658	“Speak to the entire congregation of the Israelites
c12659	and tell them:
c12660	‘Be holy
c12661	because I, the LORD your God, am holy.
c12662	Each
c12663	of you must respect his mother and father,
c12664	and you must observe My Sabbaths.
c12665	I am the LORD your God.
c12666	Do not turn to idols
c12667	or make for yourselves molten gods.
c12668	I am the LORD your God.
c12669	When you sacrifice a peace offering to the LORD,
c12670	you shall offer it for your acceptance.
c12671	It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it,
c12672	or on the next day;
c12674	but what remains on the third day
c12675	must be burned up.
c12676	If any is eaten on the third day,
c12677	it is tainted
c12678	and will not be accepted.
c12680	Whoever eats
c12681	it will bear his iniquity,
c12682	for he has profaned what is holy to the LORD.
c12683	That person must be cut off from his people.
c12685	When you reap the harvest of your land,
c12686	you are not to reap to the very edges of your field
c12688	or gather the gleanings of your harvest.
c12689	You must not strip your vineyard bare
c12690	or gather its fallen grapes.
c12691	Leave them for the poor and the sojourner.
c12692	I am the LORD your God.
c12693	You must not steal.
c12694	You must not lie
c12695	or deceive
c12696	one another.
c12697	You must not swear falsely by My name
c12698	and so profane the name of your God.
c12699	I am the LORD.
c12700	You must not defraud your neighbor
c12701	or rob him.
c12702	You must not withhold until morning the wages due a hired hand.
c12703	You must not curse the deaf
c12704	or place a stumbling block before the blind,
c12705	but you are to fear your God.
c12706	I am the LORD.
c12707	“You must not pervert justice;
c12708	you must not show partiality to the poor
c12709	or favoritism to the rich;
c12710	you are to judge your neighbor fairly.
c12711	You must not go about spreading slander among your people.
c12712	You must not endanger the life of your neighbor.
c12713	I am the LORD.
c12714	You must not harbor hatred against your brother in your heart.
c12715	Directly rebuke your neighbor,
c12716	so that you will not incur guilt on account of him.
c12717	Do not seek revenge
c12718	or bear a grudge against any of your people,
c12719	but love your neighbor as yourself.
c12720	I am the LORD.
c12721	You are to keep My statutes.
c12722	You shall not crossbreed two different kinds of livestock;
c12723	you shall not sow your fields with two kinds
c12724	of seed; and you shall not wear clothing made of two kinds of material.
c12725	a man
c12726	If ... has sexual relations with
c12727	a slave girl
c12728	promised to another man
c12729	but who has not been redeemed
c12730	or given her freedom, ... [But] they are not
c12731	there must be due punishment.
c12732	to be put to death, ... she had not
c12733	because ... been freed.
c12734	[The man,] however, must bring a ram to the entrance of the tent of Meeting as his guilt offering to the LORD.
c12735	The priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD with the ram of the guilt offering for the sin
c12736	he has committed,
c12737	and he will be forgiven the sin
c12738	he has committed.
c12739	When you enter the land
c12740	and plant any kind of tree for food,
c12741	you shall regard the fruit as forbidden.
c12742	For three years it will be forbidden to you
c12743	and must not be eaten.
c12744	In the fourth year all its fruit must be consecrated
c12745	as a praise offering to the LORD.
c12746	But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit;
c12747	thus your harvest will be increased.
c12748	I am the LORD your God.
c12749	You must not eat anything with blood still in it.
c12750	You must not ... or sorcery.
c12751	practice divination
c12752	You must not cut off the hair at the sides of your head
c12753	or clip off the edges of your beard.
c12754	You must not make any cuts in your bodies for the dead
c12755	or put tattoo marks on yourselves.
c12756	I am the LORD.
c12757	You must not defile your daughter
c12758	by making her a prostitute,
c12759	or the land will be prostituted
c12760	and filled with depravity.
c12761	You must keep My Sabbaths
c12762	and have reverence for My sanctuary.
c12763	I am the LORD.
c12764	“You must not turn to mediums
c12765	[or] spiritists; do not seek them out,
c12766	or you will be defiled by them.
c12767	I am the LORD your God.
c12768	You are to rise in the presence of the elderly,
c12769	honor the aged,
c12770	and fear your God.
c12771	I am the LORD.
c12772	When a foreigner resides with you in your land,
c12773	you must not oppress him.
c12774	You must treat the foreigner ... as native-born
c12775	living among you
c12776	and love him as yourself,
c12777	for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
c12778	I am the LORD your God.
c12779	You must not use dishonest measures of length, weight, or volume.
c12780	You shall maintain honest scales [and] weights, an honest ephah, [and] an honest hin.
c12781	I am the LORD your God,
c12782	who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
c12783	You must keep all My statutes and all My ordinances
c12784	and follow them.
c12785	I am the LORD.’”
c12786	The LORD said to Moses,
c12788	“Tell the Israelites,
c12789	‘Any Israelite or foreigner
c12790	living in Israel
c12791	who gives any of his children to Molech
c12792	must be put to death.
c12793	The people of the land are to stone him.
c12794	And I will set My face against that man
c12795	and cut him off from his people,
c12796	because by giving his offspring to Molech,
c12797	he has defiled My sanctuary
c12798	and profaned My holy name.
c12799	And if the people of the land ever hide their eyes ... the man
c12800	who gives one of his children to Molech,
c12801	and fail to put to death
c12802	then I will set My face against that man and his family
c12803	and cut off ... both him and all
c12804	who follow him in prostituting
c12805	themselves with Molech.
c12806	from their people
c12807	Whoever
c12808	turns to mediums or spiritists
c12809	to prostitute himself with them,
c12810	I will also set My face against that person
c12811	and cut him off from his people.
c12812	Consecrate yourselves,
c12813	therefore, and be holy,
c12814	for I am the LORD your God.
c12815	And you shall keep My statutes
c12816	and practice them.
c12817	I am the LORD
c12818	who sanctifies you.
c12819	If anyone
c12820	curses his father or mother,
c12821	he must be put to death.
c12822	He has cursed his father or mother;
c12823	his blood [shall be] upon him.
c12824	If a man
c12825	commits adultery with [another] man’s wife—
c12826	with the wife of his neighbor—
c12827	both the adulterer and the adulteress must surely be put to death.
c12828	If a man
c12829	lies with his father’s wife,
c12830	he has uncovered his father’s nakedness.
c12831	Both must surely be put to death;
c12832	their blood [is] upon them.
c12833	If a man
c12834	lies with his daughter-in-law,
c12835	both must surely be put to death.
c12836	They have acted perversely;
c12837	their blood [is] upon them.
c12838	If a man
c12839	lies with a man as with a woman,
c12840	they have both committed an abomination.
c12841	They must surely be put to death;
c12842	their blood [is] upon them.
c12843	If a man
c12844	marries both a woman and her mother,
c12845	it is depraved.
c12846	Both he and they must be burned in the fire,
c12847	so that there will be no depravity among you.
c12848	If a man
c12849	has sexual relations with an animal,
c12850	he must be put to death.
c12851	And you are also to kill the animal.
c12852	If a woman
c12853	approaches any animal
c12854	to mate with it,
c12855	you must kill both the woman and the animal.
c12856	They must surely be put to death;
c12857	their blood [is] upon them.
c12858	If a man
c12859	marries his sister, whether the daughter of his father or his mother,
c12860	and they have sexual relations,
c12862	it is a disgrace.
c12863	They must be cut off in the sight of their people.
c12864	He has uncovered the nakedness of his sister;
c12865	he shall bear his iniquity.
c12866	If a man
c12867	lies with a menstruating woman
c12868	and has sexual relations with her,
c12869	he has exposed the source of her flow,
c12870	and she has uncovered the source of her blood.
c12871	Both of them must be cut off from their people.
c12872	You must not have sexual relations with the sister of your mother or your father,
c12873	for it is exposing one’s own kin;
c12874	both shall bear their iniquity.
c12875	If a man
c12876	lies with his uncle’s wife,
c12877	he has uncovered the nakedness of his uncle.
c12878	They will bear their sin;
c12879	they shall die childless.
c12880	If a man
c12881	marries his brother’s wife,
c12882	it is an act of impurity.
c12883	He has uncovered the nakedness of his brother;
c12884	they shall be childless.
c12885	You are therefore to keep all My statutes and ordinances,
c12887	so that the land ... will not vomit you out.
c12888	where I am bringing
c12889	you to live
c12890	You must not follow the statutes of the nations
c12891	I am driving out before you,
c12892	for they did all these things,
c12893	and I abhorred them.
c12894	But I have said to you,
c12895	“You will inherit their land,
c12896	since I will give it to you
c12897	as an inheritance, a land flowing with milk and honey.”
c12898	I am the LORD your God,
c12899	who has set you apart from the peoples.
c12900	You are therefore to distinguish between clean and unclean animals
c12901	and birds.
c12902	Do not become contaminated by any animal or bird, or by anything
c12903	that crawls on the ground;
c12904	I have set these apart
c12905	as unclean for you.
c12906	You are to be holy to Me
c12907	because I, the LORD, am holy,
c12908	and I have set you apart from the nations
c12909	that you should be My own.
c12910	A man or a woman
c12911	who is a medium or a spiritist
c12912	must surely be put to death.
c12913	They shall be stoned;
c12914	their blood [is] upon them.’”
c12915	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c12916	“Speak to Aaron’s sons, the priests,
c12917	and tell them:
c12918	‘[A priest] is not to defile himself for a dead person among his people,
c12919	except ... family—
c12920	for his immediate
c12921	his mother, father, son, daughter, brother,
c12922	or his unmarried sister
c12923	who is near to him,
c12924	since she has no husband.
c12926	He is not to defile himself for those related to him by marriage,
c12927	and so profane himself.
c12928	Priests must not make bald spots on their heads,
c12929	shave off the edges of their beards,
c12930	or make cuts in their bodies.
c12931	They must be holy to their God
c12932	and not profane the name of their God.
c12933	For they present the offerings made by fire to the LORD, the food of their God.
c12934	So they must be holy.
c12935	[A priest] must not marry a woman defiled by prostitution
c12937	divorced by her husband,
c12938	or
c12939	for [the priest] is holy to his God.
c12940	You are to regard him as holy,
c12941	since he presents the food of your God.
c12942	He shall be holy to you,
c12943	because I, the LORD ... am holy.
c12944	who sets you apart,
c12945	a priest’s daughter
c12946	If ... defiles herself
c12947	by prostituting herself,
c12948	she profanes her father;
c12949	she must be burned in the fire.
c12950	The priest
c12951	who is highest among his brothers,
c12952	who has had the anointing oil poured on his head
c12953	and has been ordained
c12954	to wear the priestly garments,
c12955	must not dishevel his hair
c12956	or tear his garments.
c12957	He must not go near any dead body
c12958	or make himself unclean, even for his father or mother.
c12959	He must not leave
c12960	or desecrate the sanctuary of his God,
c12961	for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him.
c12962	I am the LORD.
c12963	The woman he marries must be a virgin.
c12964	a widow, a divorced woman, or one defiled by prostitution.
c12965	He is not to marry
c12966	He is to marry a virgin from his own people,
c12967	so that he does not defile his offspring among his people,
c12968	for I am the LORD
c12969	who sanctifies him.’”
c12970	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c12972	“Say to Aaron,
c12974	‘For the generations to come, ... of your descendants
c12975	who has a physical defect
c12976	none ... may approach
c12977	to offer the food of his God.
c12978	No man
c12979	who has any defect
c12980	may approach— no man who is blind, lame, disfigured, or deformed;
c12981	no man ... or
c12982	who has a broken foot ... hand,
c12983	or who is a hunchback or dwarf, or who has an eye defect, a festering rash, scabs, or a crushed testicle.
c12984	No
c12985	who has a defect
c12986	descendant of Aaron the priest ... shall approach
c12987	to present the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
c12988	[Since] he has a defect,
c12989	he is not to come near ... the food of his God.
c12990	to offer
c12991	He may eat the most holy food of his God as well as the holy [food],
c12992	but ... he must not go near the curtain
c12993	or approach the altar,
c12994	because he has a defect,
c12995	so as not to desecrate My sanctuaries.
c12996	For I am the LORD
c12997	who sanctifies them.’”
c12998	Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
c12999	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c13001	“Tell Aaron and his sons
c13002	to treat with respect the sacred offerings ... the Israelites
c13003	so that they do not profane My holy name.
c13004	that ... have consecrated to Me,
c13005	I am the LORD.
c13006	Say to them:
c13007	‘For the generations to come,
c13008	if any
c13009	of your descendants ... approaches the sacred offerings that
c13010	the Israelites consecrate to the LORD,
c13011	in a state of uncleanness
c13012	that person must be cut off from My presence.
c13013	I am the LORD.
c13014	of Aaron’s descendants
c13015	who has a skin disease
c13016	or a discharge
c13017	None ... shall eat from the sacred offerings
c13018	until he is clean.
c13020	Whoever touches anything defiled by a corpse
c13021	or by a man
c13022	who has an emission of semen,
c13023	or whoever
c13024	touches a crawling creature
c13026	or a person
c13027	that makes him unclean, whatever the uncleanness may be,
c13028	the man
c13029	who touches
c13030	any of these will remain unclean until evening.
c13031	He must not eat from the sacred offerings
c13032	unless he has bathed himself with water.
c13033	When the sun has set,
c13034	he will become clean,
c13035	and then he may eat from the sacred offerings,
c13036	for they are his food.
c13037	He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals,
c13038	which would make him unclean.
c13039	I am the LORD.
c13040	[The priests] must keep My charge,
c13041	lest they bear the guilt
c13042	and die
c13043	because they profane it.
c13044	I am the LORD
c13045	who sanctifies them.
c13046	No one outside a priest’s family is to eat the sacred offering,
c13047	nor may a foreigner staying with a priest, or a hired hand, eat of [it].
c13048	a priest
c13049	But if ... purchases someone with his money,
c13050	that person may eat of it.
c13051	is born in his household,
c13052	or one
c13053	the priest’s daughter
c13054	If ... is married to a man other [than a priest],
c13055	she is not to eat of the sacred contributions.
c13056	a priest’s daughter
c13057	But if ... becomes widowed or divorced
c13058	with no children
c13059	and returns to her father’s house, ... as in her youth.
c13060	she may share her father’s food
c13061	But no outsider may share it.
c13062	anyone
c13063	If ... eats a sacred offering in error,
c13064	he must add a fifth to
c13065	its value and give the sacred offering to the priest.
c13066	The priests must not profane the sacred offerings the Israelites
c13067	present to the LORD
c13068	and thus to bear the punishment for guilt.
c13069	by allowing the people to eat the sacred offerings
c13070	For I am the LORD
c13071	who sanctifies them.’”
c13072	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c13074	“Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites
c13075	and tell them,
c13076	‘Any man of the house of Israel or any foreign resident
c13077	who presents his offering, ... a freewill gift or payment of a vow
c13078	whether the burnt offering [is] ... to the LORD,
c13079	must offer an unblemished male from the cattle, sheep, or goats in order for it to be accepted on your behalf.
c13080	anything
c13081	with a defect,
c13082	You must not present
c13083	because it will not be accepted on your behalf.
c13084	a man
c13085	When ... presents a peace offering to the LORD
c13086	to fulfill a vow
c13087	from the herd or flock ... or as a freewill offering,
c13088	it must be without blemish ... to be acceptable.
c13089	[or] defect
c13090	that is blind, injured, or maimed, or anything with a running sore, festering rash, or scab;
c13091	You are not to present any animal to the LORD
c13092	you must not put any of these on the altar as an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c13093	an ox or sheep that has a deformed or stunted limb,
c13094	You may present as a freewill offering
c13095	but it is not acceptable to fulfill a vow.
c13096	You are not to present to the LORD [an animal whose testicles are] bruised, crushed, torn, or cut;
c13097	you are not to sacrifice them in your land.
c13098	Neither you nor a foreigner shall present food to your God from any such [animal].
c13099	because they are deformed
c13100	and flawed.’”
c13101	They will not be accepted on your behalf,
c13102	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c13104	an ox, a sheep, or a goat
c13105	“When ... is born,
c13106	it must remain with its mother for seven days.
c13107	From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as an offering to the LORD made by fire.
c13108	an ox or sheep
c13109	But you must not slaughter ... on the same day as its young.
c13110	When you sacrifice a thank offering to the LORD,
c13111	offer it so that it may be acceptable on your behalf.
c13112	It must be eaten that same day.
c13113	Do not leave any of it until morning.
c13114	I am the LORD.
c13115	You are to keep My commandments
c13116	and practice them.
c13117	I am the LORD.
c13118	You must not profane My holy name.
c13119	I must be acknowledged as holy among the Israelites.
c13120	I am the LORD
c13121	who sanctifies you,
c13122	who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
c13123	to be your God.
c13124	I am the LORD.”
c13125	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c13127	“Speak to the Israelites
c13128	and say to them,
c13129	are My appointed feasts, ... of the LORD
c13130	that you will proclaim
c13131	as sacred assemblies.
c13132	‘These
c13133	the feasts
c13134	For six days work may be done,
c13135	but the seventh day is to be a Sabbath of complete rest, a day of sacred assembly.
c13136	You are not to do any work;
c13137	wherever you live, it is a Sabbath to the LORD.
c13138	These are the LORD’s appointed feasts, the sacred assemblies
c13139	you are to proclaim at their appointed times.
c13140	The Passover to the LORD begins at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month.
c13141	On the fifteenth day of the same month [begins] the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD.
c13142	For seven days you must eat unleavened bread.
c13143	On the first day you shall hold a sacred assembly;
c13144	you are not to do any ordinary work.
c13145	For seven days you are to present an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c13146	On the seventh day there shall be a sacred assembly;
c13147	you must not do any ordinary work.’”
c13148	And the LORD said to Moses,
c13150	“Speak to the Israelites
c13151	and say,
c13152	‘When you enter the land
c13153	I am giving you
c13154	and reap its harvest,
c13155	you are to bring to the priest the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest.
c13156	And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD so that it may be accepted of your behalf;
c13157	the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
c13158	On the day ... you shall offer
c13159	you wave the sheaf,
c13160	a year-old lamb without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD,
c13161	along with its grain offering of two-tenths an ephah of fine flour
c13162	mixed with oil—
c13163	an offering made by fire to the LORD, a pleasing aroma—
c13164	and its drink offering of a quarter hin of wine.
c13165	You must not eat any bread or roasted or new grain until the very day
c13166	you have brought this offering to your God.
c13167	This is to be a permanent statute for the generations to come, wherever you live.
c13168	From the day after ... the day ... you are to count ... weeks.
c13169	you brought the sheaf of the wave offering,
c13170	the Sabbath, ... seven full
c13171	You shall count fifty days until the day after the seventh Sabbath,
c13172	and then present an offering of new grain to the LORD.
c13173	Bring two loaves of bread from your dwellings as a wave offering,
c13174	each made from two-tenths an ephah of fine flour,
c13175	baked with yeast,
c13176	as the firstfruits to the LORD.
c13177	Along with the bread you are to present seven unblemished male lambs a year old, one young bull, and two rams.
c13178	They will be a burnt offering to the LORD,
c13179	together with their grain offerings and drink offerings— an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c13180	You shall also prepare one male goat as a sin offering
c13181	and two male lambs a year old as a peace offering.
c13182	The priest is to wave [the lambs] as a wave offering before the LORD, together with the bread of the firstfruits. The bread and the two lambs
c13183	are to be sacred to the LORD for the priest.
c13184	On that same day you are to proclaim
c13185	a sacred assembly,
c13186	and you are not to do any regular work.
c13187	This is to be a permanent statute wherever you live for the generations to come.
c13189	When you reap the harvest of your land,
c13190	do not ... all the way to the edges of your field
c13191	reap
c13192	or gather the gleanings of your harvest.
c13193	Leave them for the poor and the foreign resident.
c13194	I am the LORD your God.’”
c13195	The LORD also said to Moses,
c13197	“Speak to the Israelites
c13198	[and] say,
c13199	‘On the first day of the seventh month you are to have a day of rest, a sacred assembly announced by trumpet blasts.
c13200	You must not do any ordinary work,
c13201	but you are to present an offering made by fire to the LORD.’”
c13202	Again the LORD said to Moses,
c13204	“vvv The tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement.
c13205	You are to hold a sacred assembly
c13206	and humble your souls
c13207	and present an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c13208	On this day you are not to do any work,
c13209	for it is the Day of Atonement,
c13210	when atonement is made for you before the LORD your God.
c13211	If anyone
c13212	does not humble himself on this day,
c13213	he must be cut off from his people.
c13214	anyone
c13215	who does any work on this day.
c13216	I will destroy from among his people
c13217	You are not to do any work {at all}.
c13218	This is a permanent statute for the generations to come, wherever you live.
c13219	It will be a Sabbath of complete rest for you,
c13220	and you shall humble your souls.
c13221	From the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening you are to observe your Sabbath.’”
c13222	And the LORD said to Moses,
c13224	“Speak to the Israelites
c13225	[and] say,
c13226	‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month the Feast of Tabernacles to the LORD [begins], and it continues for seven days.
c13227	On the first day [there shall be] a sacred assembly.
c13228	You are not to do any regular work.
c13229	For seven days you are to present an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c13230	On the eighth day you are to hold a sacred assembly
c13231	and present an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c13232	It [is] a solemn assembly;
c13233	you are not to do any regular work.
c13234	“These are the LORD’s appointed feasts,
c13235	which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies
c13236	for presenting offerings by fire to the LORD— burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its designated day.
c13237	[These offerings are] in addition to the offerings for the LORD’s Sabbaths, [and in addition] to your gifts, to all your vow offerings, and to all the freewill offerings
c13238	you give to the LORD.
c13239	On the fifteenth day of the seventh month,
c13240	after you have gathered the produce of the land,
c13241	you are to celebrate a feast to the LORD for seven days.
c13242	There shall be complete rest on the first day
c13243	and [also] on the eighth day.
c13244	On the first day you are to gather the branches of majestic trees— palm branches and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook—
c13245	and rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
c13246	You are to celebrate this as a feast to the LORD for seven days each year.
c13247	This is a permanent statute for the generations to come;
c13248	you are to celebrate it in the seventh month.
c13249	You are to live in booths for seven days.
c13250	All the native-born of Israel must live in booths,
c13251	so that your descendants will know
c13252	that I made the Israelites live in booths
c13253	when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.
c13254	I am the LORD your God.’”
c13255	So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed [feasts] of the LORD.
c13256	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c13258	“Command the Israelites
c13259	to bring you clear oil from pressed olives for the light,
c13260	that the lamp may be kept burning continually.
c13261	Outside the veil of the testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend it continually before the LORD from evening until morning.
c13262	This is a permanent statute for the generations to come.
c13263	He shall tend the lamps on the pure [gold] lampstand before the LORD continually.
c13264	You are also to take fine flour
c13265	and bake twelve loaves,
c13266	using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf,
c13267	and set them in two rows—
c13268	six per row—
c13269	on the table of pure gold before the LORD.
c13270	And you are to place pure frankincense near each row,
c13271	so that it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread,
c13272	an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c13273	Every Sabbath day the bread is to be set out before the LORD
c13274	on behalf of the Israelites as a perpetual covenant.
c13275	It belongs to Aaron and his sons,
c13276	who are to eat it in a holy place;
c13277	for it [is] to him a most holy [part] of the offerings made by fire to the LORD—
c13278	[his] portion forever.”
c13279	Now the son of an Israelite mother ... went out
c13280	and an Egyptian father ... the Israelites,
c13281	among
c13282	and a fight broke out in the camp [between him] and an Israelite.
c13283	The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name
c13284	and cursed.
c13285	So they brought him to Moses.
c13286	(His mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)
c13287	They placed him in custody
c13288	until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them.
c13289	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c13291	“Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp,
c13292	and have all who heard him lay their hands on his head;
c13293	then have the whole assembly stone him.
c13294	And you are to tell the Israelites,
c13296	anyone
c13297	‘If ... curses his God,
c13298	he shall bear the consequences of his sin.
c13300	Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD
c13301	must to be put to death;
c13302	the whole assembly surely must stone him,
c13303	whether he is a foreign resident or native;
c13304	if he blasphemes the Name,
c13305	he must be put to death.
c13306	a man
c13307	And if ... takes the life of anyone else,
c13308	he must surely be put to death.
c13310	Whoever kills an animal ... life
c13311	must make restitution— ... for life.
c13312	anyone
c13313	If ... injures his neighbor,
c13314	whatever he has done
c13315	must be done to him:
c13316	fracture for fracture,
c13317	eye for eye,
c13318	tooth for tooth.
c13319	Just as he injured the other person,
c13320	the same must be inflicted on him.
c13322	Whoever kills an animal
c13323	must make restitution,
c13325	but whoever kills a man
c13326	must be put to death.
c13327	You are to have the same standard of law
c13328	for the foreign resident and the native;
c13329	for I am the LORD your God.’”
c13330	Then Moses spoke to the Israelites,
c13331	and they took the one who had cursed outside the camp
c13332	and stoned him.
c13333	So the Israelites did
c13334	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c13335	Then the LORD said to Moses on Mount Sinai,
c13337	“Speak to the Israelites
c13338	and say,
c13339	‘When you enter the land
c13340	I am giving you,
c13341	the land itself must observe a Sabbath to the LORD.
c13342	For six years you may sow your field
c13343	and prune your vineyard
c13344	and gather its crops.
c13345	But in the seventh year {there shall} be a Sabbath of complete rest for the land— a Sabbath to the LORD.
c13346	You are not to sow your field
c13347	or prune your vineyard.
c13348	You are not to reap the aftergrowth of your harvest
c13349	or gather the grapes of your untended vines.
c13350	The land must have a year of complete rest.
c13351	Whatever the land yields during the Sabbath year shall be food for you— for yourself, your manservant and maidservant, the hired hand or foreigner
c13352	who stays with you,
c13353	and for your livestock and the wild animals
c13354	in your land.
c13355	All of its growth may serve
c13356	as food.
c13357	And you shall count off seven sabbaths of years— seven times seven years—
c13358	so that time of the seven sabbatical years amounts to forty-nine years.
c13359	Then you are to sound the trumpet far and wide on the tenth day of the seventh month,
c13360	on the Day of Atonement. You shall sound [it] throughout your land.
c13361	So you are to consecrate the fiftieth year
c13362	and proclaim liberty in the land for all its inhabitants.
c13363	It shall be your Jubilee,
c13364	of you is to return
c13365	when each ... to his property
c13367	[and] to his clan.
c13369	The fiftieth year ... a jubilee
c13370	will be ... for you;
c13371	you are not to sow
c13372	or reap what grows by itself
c13373	or harvest the untended vines.
c13374	For it [is] a jubilee;
c13375	it shall be holy to you.
c13376	You may eat only the crops taken directly from the field.
c13377	In this Year of Jubilee, ... of you shall return
c13378	each ... to his own property.
c13379	If you make a sale to your neighbor
c13380	or a purchase from him,
c13381	you must not take advantage
c13382	of one another.
c13383	You are to buy from your neighbor according to the number of years since the last Jubilee;
c13384	he is to sell to you according to the number of harvest years {remaining}.
c13385	In proportion to a greater number of years you shall increase the price,
c13386	or decrease [it] in proportion to a lesser number of years;
c13387	for he is selling you a given number of harvests.
c13388	Do not take advantage
c13389	of one another,
c13390	but fear your God;
c13391	for I am the LORD your God.
c13392	You are to keep My statutes
c13393	and carefully ... My judgments,
c13394	observe
c13395	so that you may dwell securely in the land.
c13396	Then the land will yield its fruit,
c13397	so that you can eat your fill
c13398	and dwell in safety in the land.
c13399	Now you may wonder,
c13400	‘What will we eat in the seventh year
c13401	if we do not sow
c13402	or gather our produce?’
c13403	But I will send My blessing upon you in the sixth year,
c13404	so that [the land] will yield a crop sufficient for three years.
c13405	While you are sowing in the eighth year,
c13406	you will be eating from the previous harvest until the ninth year,
c13407	when its harvest comes in.
c13409	The land must not be sold permanently,
c13410	because it is Mine,
c13411	and you are but foreigners and sojourners with Me.
c13412	Thus for every piece of property you possess, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
c13413	If your brother becomes impoverished
c13414	and sells some of his property,
c13415	of kin may come
c13416	his nearest
c13417	and redeem what his brother has sold.
c13418	a man
c13419	Or if ... has no one to redeem it for him,
c13420	but he prospers
c13421	and acquires enough to redeem his land,
c13422	he shall calculate the years since its sale,
c13423	repay the balance to the man
c13424	to whom he sold it,
c13425	and return to his property.
c13426	But if he cannot obtain enough
c13427	to repay him,
c13428	what he sold will remain in possession
c13429	of the buyer
c13430	until the Year of Jubilee.
c13431	In the Jubilee, however, it is to be released,
c13432	so that he may return to his property.
c13433	a man
c13434	If ... sells a house in a walled city,
c13435	he retains his right of redemption
c13436	until a full year after its sale;
c13437	during that year it may be redeemed.
c13438	If it is not redeemed
c13439	by the end of a full year,
c13440	then the house
c13441	city
c13442	in the walled
c13443	is permanently
c13444	transferred to its buyer
c13445	and his descendants.
c13446	It is not to be released in the Jubilee.
c13447	But houses in villages
c13448	with no walls around them
c13449	are considered as open fields.
c13450	They may be redeemed, and they shall be
c13451	released in the Jubilee.
c13452	As for the cities of the Levites, ... their houses in the cities they possess.
c13453	the Levites always have the right to redeem
c13454	So whatever belongs to the Levites may be redeemed—
c13455	a house sold in a city they possess— and must be released in the Jubilee,
c13456	because the houses in the cities of the Levites
c13457	are their possession among the Israelites.
c13458	But the open fields around their cities may not be sold,
c13459	for this is their permanent possession.
c13460	Now if your countryman becomes destitute
c13461	and cannot support himself among you,
c13462	you are to help him
c13463	like a foreigner or temporary resident,
c13464	so that he can continue to live among you.
c13465	Do not take any interest or profit from him,
c13466	but fear your God,
c13467	that your countryman may live among you.
c13468	You must not lend him your silver with interest
c13469	or sell him your food for profit.
c13470	I am the LORD your God,
c13471	who brought you out of Egypt
c13472	to give you the land of Canaan
c13473	and to be your God.
c13474	If a countryman among you becomes destitute
c13475	and sells himself to you,
c13476	you must not force him into slave labor.
c13477	Let him stay with you as a hired worker or temporary resident;
c13478	he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
c13479	Then he and his children are to be released,
c13480	and he may return to his clan
c13481	and to the property of his fathers.
c13482	Because [the Israelites are] My servants,
c13483	whom I brought out of Egypt,
c13484	they are not to be sold as slaves.
c13485	You are not to rule over them harshly,
c13486	but you shall fear your God.
c13487	Your male and female slaves
c13488	shall come
c13489	from the nations
c13490	around you;
c13491	from them you may purchase slaves.
c13492	You may also ... from the foreigners
c13493	residing among you
c13494	purchase them
c13495	or their clans
c13496	living among you
c13497	who are born in your land.
c13498	These may become your property.
c13499	You may leave them to your sons after
c13500	you to inherit as property; ... for life.
c13501	you can make them slaves
c13502	But as for your brothers, the Israelites, ... man ... over his brother.
c13503	no ... may rule harshly
c13504	If a foreigner or temporary resident living among you prospers,
c13505	but your brother dwelling near him becomes poor
c13506	and sells himself to the foreigner or to a member of [his] clan,
c13507	after he has sold himself.
c13508	he retains the right of redemption
c13509	One of his brothers may redeem him:
c13510	either his uncle or cousin,
c13511	or any close relative from his clan, may redeem him.
c13512	Or if he prospers,
c13513	he may redeem himself.
c13514	He and his purchaser will then count the time
c13515	from the year he sold himself
c13516	up to the Year of Jubilee.
c13517	The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years,
c13518	based on the daily wages of a hired hand.
c13519	If many years remain,
c13520	he must pay for his redemption in proportion to his purchase price.
c13521	If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee,
c13522	he is to calculate
c13523	and pay his redemption according to his remaining years.
c13524	Like a man hired from year to year, he will stay with him,
c13525	but a foreign owner must not rule over him harshly in your sight.
c13526	Even if he is not redeemed in any of these ways,
c13527	he and his children shall be released in the Year of Jubilee.
c13528	For the Israelites are My servants.
c13529	They are My servants,
c13530	whom I brought out of Egypt.
c13531	I am the LORD your God.
c13532	You must not make idols for yourselves ... a carved image
c13533	or set up ... or sacred pillar,
c13534	or place a sculpted stone in your land
c13535	to bow down to it,
c13536	for I am the LORD your God.
c13537	You must keep My Sabbaths
c13538	and show reverence for My sanctuary.
c13539	I am the LORD.
c13540	If you follow My statutes
c13541	and carefully observe My commandments,
c13543	I will give you rains in their season,
c13544	and the land will yield its produce,
c13545	and the trees of the field will bear their fruit.
c13546	Your threshing will continue until the grape harvest,
c13547	and the grape harvest will continue until sowing time;
c13548	you will have your fill of food to eat
c13549	and will dwell securely in your land.
c13550	And I will give peace to the land,
c13551	and you will lie down
c13552	with nothing to fear.
c13553	I will rid the land of dangerous animals,
c13554	and no sword will pass through your land.
c13555	You will pursue your enemies,
c13556	and they will fall by the sword before you.
c13557	Five of you will pursue a hundred,
c13558	and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand,
c13559	and your enemies will fall by the sword before you.
c13560	I will turn toward you
c13561	and make you fruitful
c13562	and multiply you,
c13563	and I will fulfill My covenant with you.
c13564	You will still be eating the old supply of grain
c13565	when you need to clear it out to make room for the new.
c13566	And I will make My dwelling place among you,
c13567	and I will not reject you.
c13568	I will walk among you
c13569	and be your God,
c13570	and you will be My people.
c13571	I am the LORD your God,
c13572	who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
c13573	that you would no longer be slaves to [the Egyptians].
c13574	I broke the bars of your yoke
c13575	and enabled you to walk in uprightness.
c13576	If, however, you fail to obey Me
c13577	and to carry out all these commandments,
c13578	and if you reject My statutes,
c13579	despise My ordinances,
c13580	and neglect to carry out all My commandments,
c13581	and so break My covenant,
c13582	then this is what I will do to you:
c13583	I will bring upon you sudden terror, wasting disease, and fever
c13584	that will destroy your sight
c13585	and drain your life.
c13586	You will sow your seed in vain,
c13587	because your enemies will eat it.
c13588	And I will set My face against you,
c13589	so that you will be defeated by your enemies.
c13590	Those who hate you will rule over you,
c13591	and you will flee
c13592	when no one
c13593	pursues you.
c13594	And if after all this you will not obey Me,
c13595	I will proceed
c13596	to punish you sevenfold for your sins.
c13597	I will break down your stubborn pride
c13598	and make your sky like iron
c13599	and your land like bronze,
c13600	and your strength will be spent in vain.
c13601	For your land will not yield its produce,
c13602	and the trees of the land will not bear their fruit.
c13603	If you walk in hostility toward Me
c13604	and refuse
c13605	to obey Me,
c13606	I will multiply your plagues seven times, according to your sins.
c13607	I will send wild animals against you
c13608	to rob you of your children,
c13609	destroy your livestock,
c13610	and reduce your numbers,
c13611	until your roads lie desolate.
c13612	And if in spite of these things you do not accept My discipline,
c13613	but continue to walk in hostility toward Me,
c13614	then I will act with hostility toward you
c13615	and strike you sevenfold for your sins.
c13616	And I will bring a sword against you
c13617	to execute the vengeance of the covenant.
c13618	Though you withdraw into your cities,
c13619	I will send a pestilence among you,
c13620	and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
c13621	When I cut off your supply of bread,
c13622	ten women will bake your bread in a single oven
c13623	and dole out your bread by weight,
c13624	so that you will eat
c13625	but not be satisfied.
c13626	But if in spite of all this you do not obey Me,
c13627	but continue to walk in hostility toward Me,
c13628	I will act with furious rage against you,
c13629	and I Myself will punish you sevenfold for your sins.
c13630	You will eat the flesh of your sons
c13631	and the flesh of your daughters.
c13632	I will destroy your high places,
c13633	cut down your incense altars,
c13634	and heap your dead bodies on the remains of your idols;
c13635	and My soul will despise you.
c13636	I will reduce your cities to rubble
c13637	and lay waste to your sanctuaries,
c13638	and I will refuse to smell the pleasing aroma of your sacrifices.
c13639	And I will lay waste to the land,
c13640	so that your enemies ... will be appalled.
c13641	who dwell in it
c13642	But I will scatter you among the nations
c13643	and will draw out a sword after you
c13644	as your land becomes desolate
c13645	and your cities are laid waste.
c13646	Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths all the days
c13647	it lies desolate,
c13648	while you are in the land of your enemies.
c13649	At that time the land will rest
c13650	and enjoy its Sabbaths.
c13651	As long as
c13652	it lies desolate,
c13653	[the land] will have the rest
c13654	it did not receive during the Sabbaths
c13655	when you lived in it.
c13656	As for those of you who survive,
c13657	I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies,
c13658	so that even the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight.
c13659	And they will flee as one flees the sword,
c13660	and fall
c13661	when no one pursues them.
c13662	They will stumble
c13663	over one another
c13664	as before the sword,
c13665	though no one is behind them.
c13666	So you will not be able to stand against your enemies.
c13667	You will perish among the nations,
c13668	and the land of your enemies will consume you.
c13670	Those of you who survive
c13671	in the lands of your enemies will waste away in their iniquity
c13672	and will decay in the sins of their fathers.
c13673	But if they will confess their iniquity and [that] of their fathers in the unfaithfulness
c13674	that they practiced against Me,
c13675	by which they have also walked in hostility toward Me—
c13676	and I acted with hostility toward
c13677	them and brought them into the land of their enemies—
c13678	and if their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled
c13679	and they will make amends for their iniquity,
c13680	then I will remember My covenant with Jacob
c13681	and My covenant with Isaac
c13682	and My covenant with Abraham,
c13683	and I will remember the land.
c13684	For the land will be abandoned by them,
c13685	and it will enjoy its Sabbaths
c13686	by lying desolate without them.
c13687	And they will pay the penalty for their iniquity,
c13688	because
c13689	they rejected My ordinances
c13690	and abhorred My statutes.
c13691	Yet in spite of this,
c13692	when they are in the land of their enemies,
c13693	I will not reject
c13694	or despise them
c13695	so as to destroy them
c13696	and break My covenant with them;
c13697	for I am the LORD their God.
c13698	But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their fathers,
c13699	whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations,
c13700	that I might be their God.
c13701	I am the LORD.”
c13702	These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws
c13703	that the LORD established between Himself and the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai.
c13704	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c13706	“Speak to the Israelites
c13707	and say to them,
c13708	someone
c13709	‘When ... makes a special vow
c13710	to the LORD involving the value of persons,
c13711	if the valuation concerns a male from twenty to sixty years of age,
c13712	then your valuation shall be fifty silver shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
c13713	Or if it is a female,
c13714	then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.
c13715	And if [the person is] from five to twenty years of age,
c13716	then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels,
c13717	and for the female ten shekels.
c13718	Now if [the person is] one month to five years of age,
c13719	then your valuation for the male shall be five shekels of silver,
c13720	and for the female three shekels of silver.
c13721	And if [the person is] sixty years of age or older,
c13722	for the male
c13723	then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels
c13724	and ten shekels and for the female.
c13725	But if he is poorer than your valuation,
c13726	he is to present the person before the priest,
c13727	and the priest shall set a value for him.
c13728	according to
c13729	what the one making the vow can afford.
c13730	The priest will set a value
c13731	If [he vows] an animal
c13732	that may be brought as an offering to the LORD,
c13733	any
c13734	of these that he gives to the LORD
c13735	will be holy.
c13736	He must not replace it
c13737	or exchange it,
c13738	either good for bad
c13739	or bad for good.
c13740	But if he does substitute one animal for another,
c13741	will be
c13742	both that animal and its substitute ... holy.
c13743	But if the vow involves any of the unclean animals
c13744	that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD,
c13745	the animal must be presented before the priest.
c13746	The priest shall set its value, whether high or low;
c13747	as the priest values it, the price will be set.
c13748	But if [the owner] ever decides to redeem [the animal],
c13749	he must add a fifth to the value.
c13750	a man
c13751	Now if ... consecrates his house as holy to the LORD,
c13752	then the priest shall value it either as good or bad.
c13753	just as the priest values it.
c13754	The price will stand
c13755	But if he who consecrated his house redeems it,
c13756	he must add a fifth to the assessed value,
c13757	and it will belong to him.
c13758	If a man consecrates to the LORD a parcel of his land,
c13759	then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed required for it— fifty shekels of silver for every homer of barley seed.
c13760	If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee,
c13761	the price will stand according to your valuation.
c13762	But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee,
c13763	the priest is to calculate the price in proportion to the years
c13764	left until the next Year of Jubilee,
c13765	so that your valuation will be reduced.
c13766	And if ... the field decides to redeem it,
c13767	the one who consecrated
c13768	he must add a fifth to the assessed value,
c13769	and it shall belong to him.
c13770	If, however, he does not redeem the field,
c13771	or if he has sold it to another man,
c13772	it may no longer be redeemed.
c13773	When the field ... it will become
c13774	is released in the Jubilee,
c13775	holy, like a field devoted to the LORD;
c13776	it becomes the property of the priests.
c13777	Now if ... a field he has purchased,
c13778	which is not a part of his own property,
c13779	he consecrates to the LORD
c13780	then the priest shall calculate for him the value up to the Year of Jubilee,
c13781	and [the man] shall pay the assessed value on that day
c13782	as a sacred offering to the LORD.
c13783	In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return
c13784	to the one from whom it was bought—
c13785	the original owner of the land.
c13786	Every valuation will be according to the sanctuary shekel,
c13787	twenty gerahs to the shekel.
c13788	But ... a firstborn
c13789	because a firstborn belongs to the LORD.
c13790	of the livestock,
c13791	no one may consecrate
c13792	Whether an animal from the herd
c13793	or flock,
c13794	it [is] the LORD’s.
c13795	But if [it is] among the unclean animals,
c13796	then he may redeem it according to your valuation
c13797	and add a fifth of its value.
c13798	If it is not redeemed,
c13799	then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
c13800	Nothing ... sets apart
c13801	that a man ... to the LORD
c13802	from all he owns—
c13804	whether a man, an animal, or his inherited land—
c13805	can be sold
c13806	or redeemed;
c13807	everything so devoted
c13808	[is] most holy to the LORD.
c13809	No
c13810	person set apart for destruction
c13811	may be ransomed;
c13812	he must surely be put to death.
c13813	Thus any the tithe from the land, [whether] from the seed of the land or the fruit of the trees,
c13814	belongs to the LORD; it
c13815	is holy to the LORD.
c13816	If a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe,
c13817	he must add a fifth to its value.
c13818	Every tenth animal from the herd or flock
c13819	that passes under the shepherd’s rod
c13820	will be holy to the LORD.
c13821	He must not inspect whether it is good or bad,
c13822	and he shall not make any substitution.
c13823	But if he does make a substitution,
c13824	shall become
c13825	both the animal and its substitute ... holy;
c13826	they cannot be redeemed.’”
c13827	These are the commandments
c13828	that the LORD gave to Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai.
c13829	On the first day of the second month of the second year ... the LORD spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting in the Wilderness of Sinai.
c13830	after [the Israelites] had come out of the land of Egypt,
c13831	He told him,
c13832	“Take a census of the entire congregation of the sons of Israel by their clans and families, listing the name of every man, one by one.
c13833	who are twenty years of age or older ... everyone
c13834	by their divisions— ... who can serve in Israel’s
c13835	You and Aaron are to register those ... army.
c13836	And one man from each tribe, ... must be there with you.
c13838	the head of each family,
c13839	These are the names of the men
c13840	who are to assist you:
c13841	From [the tribe of] Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;
c13842	from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;
c13843	from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab;
c13844	from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;
c13845	from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon;
c13846	from the sons of Joseph:
c13847	from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud,
c13848	and from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur;
c13849	from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni;
c13850	from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai;
c13851	from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran;
c13852	from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel;
c13853	[and] from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.”
c13854	These men were appointed from the congregation; ... the leaders of the tribes of their fathers,
c13855	they [were] ... the heads of the clans of Israel.
c13856	So Moses and Aaron took these men
c13857	who had been designated by name,
c13858	and on the first day of the second month they assembled the whole congregation
c13859	and recorded their ancestry by clans and families, counting one by one the names of those twenty years of age or older,
c13860	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c13861	So [Moses] numbered them in the Wilderness of Sinai:
c13862	From the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, according to the records of their clans and families, counting one by one the names of every male twenty years of age or older, everyone who could serve in the army,
c13863	those registered to the tribe of Reuben numbered 46,500.
c13864	From the sons of Simeon,
c13865	according to the records of their clans and families, counting one by one the names of every male twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13866	those registered to the tribe of Simeon numbered 59,300.
c13867	From the sons of Gad,
c13868	according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13869	those registered to the tribe of Gad numbered 45,650.
c13870	From the sons of Judah,
c13871	according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13872	those registered to the tribe of Judah numbered 74,600.
c13873	From the sons of Issachar,
c13874	according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13875	those registered to the tribe of Issachar numbered 54,400.
c13876	From the sons of Zebulun,
c13877	according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13878	those registered to the tribe of Zebulun numbered 57,400.
c13879	From the sons of Joseph:
c13880	From the sons of Ephraim,
c13881	according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13882	those registered to the tribe of Ephraim numbered 40,500
c13883	And from the sons of Manasseh,
c13884	according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13885	those registered to the tribe of Manasseh numbered 32,200
c13886	From the sons of Benjamin,
c13887	according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13888	those registered to the tribe of Benjamin numbered 35,400.
c13889	From the sons of Dan,
c13890	according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13891	those registered to the tribe of Dan numbered 62,700.
c13892	From the sons of Asher,
c13893	according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13894	those registered to the tribe of Asher numbered 41,500.
c13895	From the sons of Naphtali,
c13896	according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
c13897	those registered to the tribe of Naphtali numbered 53,400.
c13898	These
c13899	were the men numbered by Moses and Aaron, with the assistance of the twelve leaders of Israel;
c13900	each one representing his family.
c13901	So all the Israelites twenty years of age or older ... were registered according to their families.
c13902	who could serve in Israel’s army
c13903	And the total of those registered numbered 603,550.
c13904	The Levites, however, were not registered with the tribe of their fathers.
c13905	For the LORD had said to Moses:
c13907	“Do not register the tribe of Levi
c13908	in the census with the other Israelites.
c13909	Instead, you are to appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, all its furnishings, and everything in it.
c13911	They shall carry the tabernacle and all its articles,
c13912	care for it,
c13913	and camp around it.
c13915	Whenever the tabernacle is to move,
c13916	the Levites are to take it down,
c13918	and whenever it is to be pitched,
c13919	the Levites are to set it up.
c13920	Any outsider
c13921	who goes near it
c13922	must be put to death.
c13923	The Israelites are to camp
c13924	each man in his own camp
c13925	and under his own [family] banner.
c13926	by their divisions,
c13927	But the Levites are to camp around the tabernacle of the Testimony
c13928	so that no wrath shall fall on the Israelite congregation.
c13929	and watch over it, ... So the Levites are responsible for the tabernacle of the Testimony.”
c13930	Thus the Israelites did everything
c13931	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c13933	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron:
c13935	“vvv ... under their respective banners beside the flags of their families,
c13936	The Israelites are to camp
c13937	around the Tent of Meeting at a distance from it.
c13939	On the east side, toward the sunrise, ... are to camp
c13940	the divisions of Judah ... under their banner:
c13941	The leader of the sons of Judah is Nahshon son of Amminadab,
c13942	and his division numbers 74,600.
c13944	will camp next to it.
c13945	The tribe of Issachar
c13946	The leader of the Issacharites is Nethanel son of Zuar,
c13947	and his division numbers 54,400.
c13948	[Next will be] the tribe of Zebulun.
c13949	The leader of the Zebulunites is Eliab son of Helon,
c13950	and his division numbers 57,400.
c13951	The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Judah is 186,400;
c13952	they shall set out first.
c13953	On the south side, the divisions of Reuben are to camp under their banner:
c13954	The leader of the Reubenites is Elizur son of Shedeur,
c13955	and his division numbers 46,500.
c13957	will camp next to it.
c13958	The tribe of Simeon
c13959	The leader of the Simeonites is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai,
c13960	and his division numbers 59,300.
c13961	[Next will be] the tribe of Gad.
c13962	The leader of the Gadites is Eliasaph son of Deuel,
c13963	and his division numbers 45,650.
c13964	The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Reuben is 151,450;
c13965	they shall set out second.
c13966	In the middle of the camps, the Tent of Meeting is to travel with the camp of the Levites.
c13967	in the order they encamped,
c13968	They are to set out
c13969	each in his own place under his banner.
c13970	On the west side, the divisions of Ephraim are to camp under their banner:
c13971	The leader of the Ephraimites is Elishama son of Ammihud,
c13972	and his division numbers 40,500.
c13973	The tribe of Manasseh will be next to it.
c13974	The leader of the Manassites is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur,
c13975	and his division numbers 32,200.
c13976	[Next will be] the tribe of Benjamin.
c13977	The leader of the Benjamites is Abidan son of Gideoni,
c13978	and his division numbers 35,400.
c13979	The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Ephraim [is] 108,100;
c13980	they shall set out third.
c13981	On the north side, the divisions of Dan are to camp under their banner:
c13982	The leader of the Danites is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai,
c13983	and his division numbers 62,700.
c13985	will camp next to it.
c13986	The tribe of Asher
c13987	The leader of the Asherites is Pagiel son of Ocran,
c13988	and his division numbers 41,500.
c13989	[Next will be] the tribe of Naphtali.
c13990	The leader of the Naphtalites is Ahira son of Enan,
c13991	and his division numbers 53,400.
c13992	The total number of men in the camp of Dan is 157,600;
c13993	they shall set out last, with their banners.”
c13994	These are the Israelites, registered according to their families.
c13995	The total of those numbered in the camps, by their divisions, was 603,550.
c13996	But the Levites were not counted among the other Israelites,
c13997	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c13998	So the Israelites did everything
c13999	the LORD commanded Moses;
c14000	they camped by their banners in this way
c14001	and set out in the same way,
c14002	each man with his clan and his family.
c14003	This is the account of Aaron and Moses at the time
c14004	the LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.
c14005	These are the names of the sons of Aaron:
c14006	Nadab the firstborn;
c14007	then Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
c14008	These [were] Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests,
c14009	who were ordained
c14010	to serve as priests.
c14011	Nadab and Abihu, however, died in the presence of the LORD
c14012	when they offered strange fire before the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai.
c14013	And since they had no sons,
c14014	only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.
c14015	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c14017	“Bring the tribe of Levi
c14018	and present them to Aaron the priest
c14019	to assist him.
c14020	They are to perform duties for him and for the whole congregation before the Tent of Meeting,
c14021	attending to the service of the tabernacle.
c14022	They shall take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting and fulfill obligations for the Israelites
c14023	by attending to the service of the tabernacle.
c14024	Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons;
c14025	have been given exclusively
c14026	they ... to him from among the Israelites.
c14027	So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons
c14028	to carry out the duties of the priesthood;
c14029	but any layman who approaches [the tabernacle] must be put to death.”
c14030	Again the LORD spoke to Moses,
c14031	saying,
c14032	I
c14033	“Behold, ... have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel in place of every firstborn Israelite from the womb.
c14034	The Levites belong to Me,
c14035	because all the firstborn [are] Mine.
c14036	On the day
c14037	I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt,
c14038	I consecrated to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast.
c14039	They are Mine;
c14040	I am the LORD.”
c14041	Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai,
c14042	saying,
c14043	“Register the Levites by their families and clans.
c14044	every male a month old or more.”
c14045	You are to count
c14046	So Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD,
c14047	as he had been commanded.
c14048	These were the sons of Levi by name:
c14049	Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
c14050	These were the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans:
c14051	Libni and Shimei.
c14052	The sons of Kohath by their clans
c14053	were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
c14054	And the sons of Merari by their clans
c14055	were Mahli and Mushi.
c14056	These
c14057	were the clans of the Levites, according to their families.
c14058	From Gershon came the Libnite clan and the Shimeite clan;
c14059	these
c14060	were the Gershonite clans.
c14061	The number of all the males a month old or more
c14062	was 7,500.
c14063	The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle,
c14064	and the leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.
c14065	The duties of the Gershonites at the Tent of Meeting [were] the tabernacle and tent, its covering, the curtain for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
c14066	the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard
c14067	that surrounds the tabernacle and altar,
c14068	and the cords— all the service [for these items].
c14069	From Kohath came the clans of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites;
c14070	these
c14071	were the clans of the Kohathites.
c14072	The number of all the males a month old or more was8,600. They were responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.
c14073	The clans of the Kohathites were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle,
c14074	and the leader of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
c14075	Their duties [were] the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary
c14076	used with them,
c14077	and the curtain— all the service [for these items].
c14078	The chief of the leaders of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest;
c14079	he oversaw those responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.
c14080	From Merari came the clans of the Mahlites and Mushites;
c14081	these
c14082	were the Merarite clans.
c14083	The number of all the males one month old or more was 6,200.
c14084	The leader of the families of the Merarites was Zuriel son of Abihail;
c14085	they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
c14086	The duties assigned to the sons of Merari were the tabernacle’s frames, crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and all the service of these [items],
c14087	as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes.
c14089	were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, before the Tent of Meeting.
c14090	Moses, Aaron, and [Aaron's sons]
c14091	They were to perform the duties of the sanctuary as a service on behalf of the Israelites;
c14092	but any outsider who approached [the sanctuary] was to be put to death.
c14093	The total number of Levites
c14094	that Moses and Aaron registered by their clans at the LORD’s command,
c14095	including all the males a month old or more, was 22,000.
c14096	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c14097	“Number every firstborn male of the Israelites a month old or more,
c14098	and list their names.
c14099	You are to take the Levites for Me—
c14100	I am the LORD—
c14101	in place of all the firstborn of Israel,
c14102	and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites.”
c14103	So Moses numbered
c14104	as the LORD had commanded him.
c14105	all the firstborn of the Israelites,
c14106	The total number of the firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.
c14107	Again the LORD spoke to Moses,
c14108	saying,
c14109	“Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel,
c14110	and the cattle of the Levites in place of their cattle.
c14111	The Levites belong to Me;
c14112	I am the LORD.
c14113	To redeem the 273
c14114	firstborn Israelites who outnumber the Levites,
c14115	you are to collect five shekels for each one,
c14116	according to the sanctuary shekel
c14117	of twenty gerahs.
c14118	Give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price
c14119	for the excess among [the Israelites].”
c14120	So Moses collected the redemption money
c14121	from those in excess of the number redeemed by the Levites.
c14122	He collected the money from the firstborn of the Israelites, 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
c14123	And Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons in obedience to the word of the LORD,
c14124	just as the LORD had commanded [him].
c14125	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c14127	“Take a census of the Kohathites among the Levites by their clans and families,
c14128	men from thirty to fifty years old— everyone
c14129	who is qualified to serve
c14130	in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
c14131	This service of the Kohathites at the Tent of Meeting regards the most holy things.
c14132	Aaron and his sons are to go in,
c14133	Whenever the camp sets out,
c14134	take down the veil of the curtain,
c14135	and cover the Ark of the Testimony with it.
c14136	They are to place over this a covering of fine leather,
c14137	spread a solid blue cloth over it,
c14138	and insert its poles.
c14139	Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth
c14140	and place the plates and cups on it, along with the bowls and pitchers for the drink offering.
c14141	The regular bread offering is to remain on it.
c14142	And they shall spread a scarlet cloth over them,
c14143	cover them with fine leather,
c14144	and insert the poles.
c14145	They are to take a blue cloth
c14146	and cover the lampstand used for light, together with its lamps, wick trimmers, and trays, as well as the jars of oil
c14147	with which to service it.
c14148	Then they shall place it with all its utensils inside a covering of fine leather
c14149	and put [it] on the carrying frame.
c14150	Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth,
c14151	cover it with fine leather,
c14152	and insert the poles.
c14153	They are to take all the utensils for serving
c14154	in the sanctuary,
c14155	place them in a blue cloth,
c14156	cover them with fine leather,
c14157	and put them on a carrying frame.
c14158	Then they shall remove the ashes from the bronze altar,
c14159	spread a purple cloth over it,
c14160	and place on it all the vessels
c14161	used to serve there:
c14162	the firepans, meat forks, shovels, and basins— all the equipment of the altar.
c14163	They are to spread over it a covering of fine leather
c14164	and insert the poles.
c14165	When Aaron and his sons have finished
c14166	covering the holy objects and all their equipment, ... the holy objects,
c14167	as soon as the camp is ready to move,
c14168	the Kohathites shall come
c14169	and do the carrying.
c14170	But they must not touch
c14171	or they will die.
c14172	These are the transportation duties of the Kohathites regarding the Tent of Meeting.
c14173	Eleazar son of Aaron the priest shall oversee the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil. He has oversight of the entire tabernacle and everything
c14174	in it, including the holy objects and their utensils.”
c14175	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c14177	“Do not allow the Kohathite tribal clans to be cut off from among the Levites.
c14178	do this for them:
c14179	In order that they may live
c14180	and not die
c14181	when they come near the most holy things,
c14182	Aaron and his sons are to go in
c14183	and assign
c14184	each man his task and what he is to carry.
c14185	But [the Kohathites] are not to go in
c14186	and look
c14187	at the holy objects, even for a moment,
c14188	or they will die.”
c14189	And the LORD said to Moses,
c14191	“Take a census of the Gershonites as well, by their families and their clans,
c14192	from thirty to fifty years old, counting everyone
c14193	who comes
c14194	to serve
c14195	in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
c14196	This is the service of the Gershonite clans
c14197	regarding work
c14198	and transport:
c14199	They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting with the covering of fine leather
c14200	over it,
c14201	the curtains for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
c14202	the curtains of the courtyard, and the curtains for the entrance at the gate of the courtyard
c14203	that surrounds the tabernacle and altar,
c14204	along with their ropes and all the equipment for their service. ... all
c14205	that needs to be done with these items.
c14206	[The Gershonites] will do
c14207	All the service of the Gershonites— all their transport duties and other work— is to be done at the direction of Aaron and his sons;
c14208	you are to assign to them all that they are responsible to carry.
c14209	This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the Tent of Meeting,
c14210	and their duties shall be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
c14211	As for the sons of Merari,
c14212	you are to register them by their clans and families,
c14213	from thirty to fifty years old, counting everyone
c14214	who comes to serve
c14215	in the work of the Tent of Meeting.
c14216	This is the duty for all their service at the Tent of Meeting: to carry
c14217	the frames of the tabernacle with its crossbars, posts, and bases,
c14218	the posts of the surrounding courtyard
c14219	with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes, including all their equipment everything related to their use.
c14220	You shall assign by name the items that they are responsible to carry.
c14221	This is the service of the Merarite clans according to all their work at the Tent of Meeting, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.”
c14222	So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation numbered the Kohathites by their clans and families,
c14223	everyone from thirty to fifty years old
c14224	who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
c14225	And those numbered by their clans totaled 2,750.
c14226	These were counted from the Kohathite clans, everyone
c14227	who could serve at the Tent of Meeting.
c14228	Moses and Aaron numbered them according to the command of the LORD through Moses.
c14229	Then the Gershonites were numbered by their clans and families,
c14230	everyone from thirty to fifty years old
c14231	who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
c14232	And those numbered by their clans and families totaled 2,630.
c14233	These were counted from the Gershonite clans
c14234	who served at the Tent of Meeting,
c14235	whom Moses and Aaron counted at the LORD’s command.
c14236	And the Merarites were counted by their clans and their families,
c14237	everyone from thirty to fifty years old
c14238	who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
c14239	The men registered by their clans numbered 3,200.
c14240	These were counted from the Merarite clans,
c14241	whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the LORD’s command through Moses.
c14242	counted ... all
c14243	So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel ... by their clans and families ... the Levites
c14244	from thirty to fifty years old
c14245	who came
c14246	to do the work of serving and carrying the Tent of Meeting.
c14247	And the number of men was 8,580.
c14248	At the LORD’s command they were registered through Moses
c14249	and each one ... his work and burden,
c14250	was assigned
c14251	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c14252	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c14254	“Command the Israelites
c14255	to send away from the camp anyone with a skin disease, anyone who has a bodily discharge, and anyone
c14256	who is defiled by a dead body.
c14257	You must send away male and female alike;
c14258	send them outside the camp,
c14259	so that they will not defile their camp
c14260	where I dwell among them.”
c14261	The Israelites did this,
c14262	sending [such people] outside the camp.
c14263	just as the LORD had instructed Moses.
c14264	[They] did
c14265	And the LORD said to Moses,
c14267	“Tell the Israelites that
c14268	a man or woman
c14269	when ... by committing any sin against another,
c14270	acts unfaithfully against the LORD
c14271	that person is guilty
c14272	and must confess the sin
c14273	he has committed.
c14274	He must pay full compensation,
c14275	add a fifth to its value,
c14276	and give all this
c14277	to the one he has wronged.
c14278	But if the man has no relative
c14279	to compensate,
c14281	the restitution
c14282	belongs to the LORD
c14283	and must be given to the priest along with the ram of atonement,
c14284	by which the atonement is made for him.
c14285	Every sacred contribution the Israelites
c14286	bring to the priest
c14287	shall belong to him.
c14288	Each man’s
c14289	sacred gifts are his own,
c14290	[he]
c14291	[but] whatever ... gives to the priest
c14292	will belong to [the priest].”
c14293	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c14295	“Speak to the Israelites
c14296	and tell them that
c14297	any man’s
c14298	if ... wife goes astray
c14299	and is unfaithful to him
c14300	by sleeping with another man,
c14301	and it is concealed from her husband
c14302	is undetected
c14303	and her impurity
c14304	(since there is no witness against her
c14305	and she was not caught in the act),
c14306	and if a feeling of jealousy comes over [her husband]
c14307	and he suspects his wife
c14308	who has defiled herself—
c14309	or if a feeling of jealousy comes over him
c14310	and he suspects her
c14311	even though she has not defiled herself—
c14312	then [he] is to bring his wife to the priest.
c14313	He must also bring for her an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour.
c14314	He is not to pour oil over
c14315	it or put frankincense on it,
c14316	because it is a grain offering for jealousy,
c14317	an offering of memorial
c14318	as a reminder of iniquity.
c14319	The priest is to bring [the wife] forward
c14320	and have her stand before the LORD.
c14321	Then [he] is to take [some] holy water in a clay jar
c14322	some of the dust
c14323	from the tabernacle floor
c14325	and put ... into the water.
c14326	After the priest has the woman stand before the LORD,
c14327	he is to let down her hair
c14328	and place in her hands the grain offering of memorial,
c14329	which is the grain offering for jealousy.
c14330	The priest is to hold the bitter water that brings a curse.
c14331	And [he] is to require the woman to take an oath
c14332	and say to her,
c14333	‘If no other man has slept with you
c14334	and you have not gone astray and become defiled while under your husband’s authority,
c14335	may you be immune to this bitter water that brings a curse.
c14336	you
c14337	But if ... have gone astray while under your husband’s authority
c14338	and defiled yourself
c14339	with a man other than your husband who has slept with you’—
c14340	then the priest shall have the woman swear under the oath of the curse—
c14342	‘May the LORD make you an attested curse among your people
c14343	if [He] makes your thigh shrivel
c14344	and your belly swell.
c14345	May this water that brings a curse enter your stomach
c14346	and cause your belly to swell
c14347	and your thigh to shrivel.’
c14348	Then the woman is to say,
c14349	‘Amen, Amen.’
c14350	And the priest shall write these curses on a scroll
c14351	and wash them off into the bitter water.
c14352	He is to have the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse,
c14353	and it will enter her and cause her bitter suffering.
c14354	The priest shall take from [her] hand the grain offering for jealousy,
c14355	wave [it] before the LORD,
c14356	and bring it to the altar.
c14357	The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial portion
c14358	and burn it on the altar;
c14359	after that he is to have the woman drink the water.
c14360	When he has made her drink the water,
c14361	and she will become
c14362	if she has defiled
c14363	herself and been unfaithful to her husband,
c14364	then the water that brings a curse will enter her and cause bitter suffering;
c14365	her belly will swell,
c14366	her thigh will shrivel,
c14367	accursed among her people.
c14368	But if the woman has not defiled herself
c14369	and is clean, she
c14370	will be unaffected
c14371	and able to conceive children.
c14372	This is the law of jealousy
c14373	when a wife goes astray ... while under her husband’s authority,
c14374	and defiles herself
c14375	or ... a husband
c14376	when a feeling of jealousy comes over
c14377	and he suspects his wife.
c14378	He is to have the woman stand before the LORD,
c14379	and the priest is to apply to her this entire ritual.
c14380	The husband will be free from guilt,
c14381	but the woman shall bear her iniquity.”
c14382	Again the LORD said to Moses,
c14384	“Speak to the Israelites
c14385	and tell them:
c14386	a man or woman
c14387	If ... makes a special
c14388	vow, the vow of a Nazirite,
c14389	to separate himself to the LORD,
c14390	he is to abstain from wine and strong drink.
c14391	He must not drink vinegar made from wine [or] strong drink,
c14392	and he must not drink any grape juice
c14393	or eat fresh grapes or raisins.
c14394	All the days of his separation,
c14395	anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins.
c14396	he is not to eat
c14397	For the entire period of his vow of separation, no razor shall pass over his head.
c14398	until the time ... is complete;
c14399	of his separation to the LORD
c14400	He must be holy
c14401	he must let the hair of his head grow long.
c14402	Throughout the days
c14403	of his separation to the LORD,
c14404	he must not go near a dead body.
c14405	Even if his father or mother or brother or sister
c14406	should die, he is not to defile himself,
c14407	because the crown of consecration to his God is upon his head.
c14408	Throughout the time of his separation, he is holy to the LORD.
c14409	If someone suddenly dies in his presence
c14410	and defiles his consecrated head of hair,
c14411	he must shave his head on the day of his cleansing—
c14412	the seventh day.
c14413	On the eighth day he must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c14414	And the priest is to offer one as a sin offering
c14415	and the other as a burnt offering
c14416	to make atonement for him,
c14417	because he has sinned by being in the presence of the dead body.
c14418	On that day he must consecrate his head again.
c14419	He must rededicate his time of separation to the LORD
c14420	and bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering.
c14421	But the preceding days shall not be counted,
c14422	because his separation was defiled.
c14423	This is the law of the Nazirite
c14424	when
c14425	his time of separation is complete:
c14426	He must be brought to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
c14427	and he is to present an offering to the LORD
c14428	of an unblemished year-old male lamb as a burnt offering,
c14429	an unblemished year-old female lamb as a sin offering,
c14430	and an unblemished ram as a peace offering—
c14431	and a basket of unleavened
c14432	cakes made from fine flour
c14433	mixed with oil
c14434	and unleavened wafers
c14435	coated with oil.
c14436	together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—
c14437	The priest is to present all these before the LORD
c14438	and make the sin offering and the burnt offering.
c14439	He shall also offer the ram as a peace offering to the LORD, along with the basket of unleavened bread.
c14440	And the priest is to offer the accompanying grain offering and drink offering.
c14441	Then at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the Nazirite is to shave his consecrated head,
c14442	take the hair,
c14443	and put it on the fire
c14444	under the peace offering.
c14445	And the priest is to take the boiled shoulder from the ram,
c14446	one unleavened cake from the basket,
c14447	and one unleavened wafer,
c14448	and put them into the hands of the Nazirite
c14449	who has just shaved [the hair of] his consecration.
c14450	The priest shall then wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
c14451	This is a holy portion for the priest, in addition to the breast of the wave offering and the thigh that was presented.
c14452	After that, the Nazirite may drink wine.
c14453	This [is] the law of the Nazirite
c14454	who vows his offering to the LORD for his separation,
c14455	in addition to whatever else he can afford;
c14456	vow
c14457	whatever ... he makes,
c14458	he must fulfill ... according to the ritual of his separation.”
c14459	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c14461	“Tell Aaron and his sons:
c14462	Say to them:
c14463	This is how you are to bless the Israelites.
c14465	‘May the LORD bless you
c14466	and keep you;
c14467	may the LORD cause His face to shine upon you
c14468	and be gracious to you;
c14469	may the LORD lift up His countenance toward you
c14470	and give you peace.’
c14471	So they shall put My name on the Israelites,
c14472	and I will bless them.”
c14473	On the day
c14474	Moses finished
c14475	setting up the tabernacle,
c14476	he anointed
c14477	and consecrated it and all its furnishings, along with the altar and all its utensils.
c14480	And the leaders of Israel, the heads of their families, presented an offering.
c14481	These [men] were the tribal leaders
c14483	who had supervised the registration.
c14484	They brought as their offering before the LORD six covered carts and twelve oxen—
c14485	and a cart from every two leaders—
c14486	an ox from each [leader]
c14487	and presented them before the tabernacle.
c14488	And the LORD said to Moses,
c14490	“Accept these [gifts] from them,
c14491	that they may be
c14492	used in the work of the Tent of Meeting.
c14493	And give them to the Levites,
c14494	to every man according to his service.”

c14680	When Moses entered the Tent of Meeting
c14681	to speak with the LORD,
c14682	he heard the voice
c14683	speaking to him ... above the mercy seat
c14684	on the Ark of the Testimony.
c14685	from between the two cherubim
c14686	Thus [the LORD] spoke to him.
c14687	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c14689	“Speak to Aaron
c14690	and tell him: ... in
c14691	When you set up
c14692	the seven lamps, they are to light [the area] ... front of the lampstand.”
c14693	And Aaron did so;
c14694	he set up the lamps facing toward the front of the lampstand,
c14695	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c14696	This is how the lampstand was constructed:
c14697	it was made of hammered gold
c14698	from its base to its blossoms,
c14699	according to the pattern
c14700	the LORD had shown Moses.
c14701	fashioned
c14702	Again the LORD spoke to Moses,
c14703	saying,
c14704	“Take the Levites from among the Israelites
c14705	and make them ceremonially clean.
c14706	This is what you must do
c14707	to cleanse them:
c14708	Sprinkle them with the water of purification.
c14709	Have them shave their whole bodies
c14710	and wash their clothes,
c14711	and so purify themselves.
c14712	Then have them take a young bull
c14713	with its grain offering of fine flour
c14714	mixed with oil,
c14715	and you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering.
c14716	Bring the Levites before the Tent of Meeting
c14717	and assemble the entire congregation of the Israelites.
c14718	You are to present the Levites before the LORD
c14719	and have the Israelites lay their hands upon [them].
c14720	Aaron is to present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel,
c14722	so that they may perform the service of the LORD.
c14723	And the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls,
c14724	and offer ... one as a sin offering
c14725	to the LORD ... and the other as a burnt offering,
c14726	to make atonement for the Levites.
c14727	You are to have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons
c14728	and then present them before the LORD as a wave offering.
c14729	In this way you shall separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites,
c14730	and the Levites will belong to Me.
c14731	After ... [they] may come
c14732	to serve at the Tent of Meeting.
c14733	you have cleansed them
c14734	and presented them as a wave offering,
c14735	For ... have been wholly given
c14736	[the Levites] ... to Me from among the sons of Israel.
c14737	I have taken them for Myself in place of all who come first from the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel.
c14738	For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is Mine, both man and beast.
c14739	on the day
c14740	I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt.
c14741	I set them apart for Myself
c14742	But I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel.
c14743	And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron [and] his sons from among the Israelites,
c14744	to perform the service for the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting
c14745	and to make atonement on their behalf,
c14746	so that no plague will come against the Israelites
c14747	when they approach the sanctuary.”
c14748	Moses, Aaron, and the entire congregation of Israel did to the Levites everything
c14749	that the LORD had commanded Moses
c14750	[they] should do.
c14751	The Levites purified
c14752	themselves and washed their clothes,
c14753	and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD.
c14754	Aaron also made atonement for them
c14755	to cleanse them.
c14756	After that, the Levites came
c14757	to perform their service at the Tent of Meeting in the presence of Aaron and his sons.
c14758	to the Levites just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c14759	So they did
c14760	And the LORD said to Moses,
c14762	“This
c14763	applies to the Levites:
c14764	Men twenty-five years of age or older shall enter
c14765	to perform the service in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
c14766	But at the age of fifty, they must retire from performing the work
c14767	and no longer serve.
c14768	After that, they may assist their brothers ... at the Tent of Meeting,
c14769	in fulfilling their duties
c14770	but they themselves are not to do the work.
c14771	This is how you are to assign responsibilities to the Levites.”
c14772	of the second year ... the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai:
c14773	after [Israel] had come out of the land of Egypt,
c14774	In the first month
c14776	“The Israelites are to observe the Passover at its appointed time.
c14777	You are to observe it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month,
c14778	in accordance with its statutes and ordinances.”
c14779	So Moses told the Israelites
c14780	to observe the Passover,
c14781	and they [did so] in the Wilderness of Sinai, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. ... everything
c14782	just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c14783	The Israelites did
c14784	But there were
c14785	some men
c14786	who were unclean due to a dead body,
c14787	so they could not
c14788	observe the Passover on that day.
c14789	And they came before Moses and Aaron that same day
c14790	and said to [Moses],
c14791	“We are unclean because of a dead body,
c14792	but why should we be excluded
c14793	from presenting the LORD’s offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?”
c14794	Moses replied.
c14795	“Wait here
c14796	until I hear
c14797	what the LORD commands concerning you,”
c14798	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c14800	“Tell the Israelites:
c14802	any one
c14803	When ... is unclean because of a dead body,
c14804	of you or ... is away on a journey,
c14805	your descendants ... or
c14806	he may still observe the Passover to the LORD.
c14807	Such people are to observe it at twilight on the fourteenth day of the second month.
c14808	They are to eat [the lamb], together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs;
c14809	they may not leave any of it until morning
c14810	or break any of its bones.
c14811	They must observe the Passover according to all its statutes.
c14812	But the man
c14813	who is ceremonially clean, ... That
c14814	is not on a journey,
c14815	and still fails
c14816	to observe the Passover,
c14817	is to be cut off from his people,
c14818	because he did not present the LORD’s offering at its appointed time.
c14819	man will bear the consequences of his sin.
c14820	If a foreigner dwelling among you
c14821	wants to observe the Passover to the LORD,
c14822	he is to do so according to the Passover statute and its ordinances.
c14823	You are to apply the same statute to both the foreigner and the native of the land.”
c14824	On the day that
c14825	the tabernacle, ... was set up,
c14826	the Tent of the Testimony, ... the cloud covered [it]
c14827	and appeared like fire above the tabernacle from evening until morning.
c14828	It remained that way continually;
c14829	the cloud would cover [the tabernacle] [by day],
c14830	and at night it would appear like fire.
c14831	Whenever
c14832	the cloud was taken up from above the Tent,
c14833	the Israelites would set out,
c14834	and wherever
c14835	the cloud settled, there
c14836	the Israelites would camp.
c14837	At the LORD’s command the Israelites set out,
c14838	and at the LORD’s command they camped.
c14839	As long as
c14840	the cloud remained over the tabernacle,
c14841	they camped.
c14842	Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days,
c14843	the Israelites kept the LORD’s charge
c14844	and did not set out.
c14845	Sometimes
c14846	the cloud remained over the tabernacle for only a few days,
c14847	and they would camp at the LORD’s command
c14848	and set out at the LORD’s command.
c14849	Sometimes
c14850	the cloud remained only from evening until morning,
c14851	and when [it] lifted in the morning,
c14852	they would set out.
c14853	Whether [it was] by day or by night,
c14854	when the cloud was taken up,
c14855	they would set out.
c14856	Whether ... for two days, a month, or longer,
c14857	[the cloud] lingered ... as long as the cloud ... over the tabernacle;
c14858	remained
c14859	the Israelites camped
c14860	and did not set out
c14862	but when it was lifted,
c14863	they would set out.
c14864	They camped at the LORD’s command,
c14865	and they set out at the LORD’s command;
c14866	they carried out the LORD’s charge according to His command through Moses.
c14867	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c14869	“Make two trumpets ... silver
c14870	of hammered
c14871	to be used for calling the congregation and for having the camps set out.
c14872	When both are sounded,
c14873	the whole congregation is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c14874	But if [only] one is sounded,
c14875	then the leaders, the heads of the clans of Israel, are to gather before you.
c14876	When you sound short blasts,
c14877	the camps ... are to set out.
c14878	that lie on the east side
c14879	When you sound the short blasts a second time,
c14880	the camps ... are to set out.
c14881	that lie on the south side
c14882	The blasts are to signal them to set out.
c14884	To convene the assembly,
c14885	you are to sound long blasts,
c14886	not short ones.
c14887	The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to sound the trumpets.
c14888	This shall be a perpetual statute for you [and] the generations to come.
c14889	When you enter into battle in your land against an adversary
c14890	who attacks you,
c14891	sound short blasts on the trumpets,
c14892	and you will be remembered before the LORD your God
c14893	and delivered from your enemies.
c14894	And on your joyous occasions, your appointed feasts, and the beginning of each month,
c14895	you are to blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings,
c14896	and they will serve as a reminder for you before your God.
c14897	I am the LORD your God.”
c14898	On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year,
c14899	the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle of the Testimony,
c14900	and the Israelites set out from the Wilderness of Sinai, traveling from place to place
c14901	until the cloud settled in the Wilderness of Paran.
c14902	They set out, this first time, according to the LORD’s command through Moses.
c14903	First, the divisions of the camp of Judah set out under their banner,
c14904	with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command.
c14905	Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar,
c14906	and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun.
c14907	Then the tabernacle was taken down,
c14908	and the Gershonites and the Merarites set out, transporting [it].
c14909	Then the divisions of the camp of Reuben set out, under their banner,
c14910	with Elizur son of Shedeur in command.
c14911	Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon,
c14912	and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.
c14913	Then the Kohathites set out, transporting the holy objects;
c14914	the tabernacle was to be set up
c14915	before their arrival.
c14916	Next, the divisions of the camp of Ephraim set out, under their banner,
c14917	with Elishama son of Ammihud in command.
c14918	Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,
c14919	and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
c14920	of the camp of Dan set out, under their banner,
c14921	serving as the rear guard for all units,
c14922	Finally, the divisions
c14923	with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai in command.
c14924	Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,
c14925	and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
c14926	This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions
c14927	as they set out.
c14928	Then Moses said to Hobab, son of [his] father-in-law Reuel the Midianite,
c14929	“We are setting out for the place
c14930	of which the LORD said:
c14931	‘I will give it to you.’
c14932	Come with us,
c14933	and we will treat you well,
c14934	for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.”
c14935	[Hobab] replied.
c14936	“I will not go,”
c14937	“Instead, I am going back to my own land and my own people.”
c14938	Moses said,
c14939	“Please do not leave us,”
c14940	“since you know
c14941	where we should camp in the wilderness,
c14942	and you can serve as our eyes.
c14944	If you come with us,
c14945	good things
c14946	whatever ... the LORD gives us.”
c14947	we will share with you
c14948	So they set out on a three-day journey from the mountain of the LORD,
c14949	with the ark of the covenant of the LORD traveling ahead of them for those three days
c14950	to seek a resting place for them.
c14951	And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day
c14952	when they set out from the camp.
c14953	Whenever
c14954	the ark set out,
c14955	Moses would say,
c14956	“Rise up,
c14957	O LORD!
c14958	May Your enemies be scattered;
c14959	may those who hate You flee before You.”
c14961	And when it came to rest,
c14962	he would say:
c14963	“Return,
c14964	O LORD,
c14965	to the countless thousands of Israel.”
c14966	Soon
c14967	the people began to complain about their hardship in the hearing of the LORD,
c14968	and when He heard [them],
c14969	His anger was kindled,
c14970	and fire from the LORD blazed among them
c14971	and consumed the outskirts of the camp.
c14972	And the people cried out to Moses,
c14973	and he prayed to the LORD,
c14974	and the fire died down.
c14975	So that place was called Taberah,
c14976	because the fire of the LORD had burned among them.
c14977	Meanwhile, the rabble
c14978	among them
c14979	had a strong craving for other food,
c14980	again
c14981	and ... the Israelites wept
c14982	and said,
c14983	“Who will feed us meat?
c14984	We remember the fish
c14985	we ate freely in Egypt,
c14986	along with the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic.
c14987	But now our appetite is gone;
c14988	there is nothing
c14989	to see but this manna!”
c14990	Now the manna
c14991	resembled coriander seed,
c14992	and its appearance was like that of gum resin.
c14993	The people walked around
c14994	and gathered it,
c14995	ground it on a handmill
c14996	or crushed it in a mortar,
c14997	then boiled it in a cooking pot
c14998	or shaped it into cakes.
c14999	It tasted like pastry baked with fine oil.
c15001	When the dew fell on the camp at night,
c15002	the manna would fall with it.
c15003	Then Moses heard the people
c15004	of family ... weeping
c15005	after family ... at the entrance of their tents,
c15006	and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly,
c15007	and Moses also was displeased.
c15008	So Moses asked the LORD,
c15009	“Why have You brought this trouble on Your servant?
c15010	Why have I not found favor in Your sight,
c15011	that You have laid upon me the burden of all these people?
c15012	Did I conceive all these people?
c15013	Did I give them birth,
c15014	so that You should tell me,
c15015	‘Carry them in your bosom,
c15016	as a nurse carries a nursing infant,’
c15017	to the land
c15018	that You swore to give their fathers?
c15019	Where can I get meat
c15020	for all these people?
c15021	For they keep crying out to me,
c15023	‘Give us meat
c15024	to eat!’
c15025	I cannot ... by myself;
c15026	carry all these people
c15027	[it is] too burdensome for me.
c15028	If this is how You are going to treat me,
c15029	please kill me right now—
c15030	if I have found favor in Your eyes—
c15031	and let me not see my own wretchedness.”
c15032	Then the LORD said to Moses, ... to
c15033	“Bring Me seventy of the elders of Israel
c15034	known to you
c15035	as leaders and officers of the people.
c15036	Bring them ... the Tent of Meeting
c15037	and have them stand there with you.
c15038	And I will come down
c15039	and speak with you there,
c15040	and I will take some of the Spirit
c15041	who is on
c15042	you and put [that Spirit] upon them.
c15043	They will help you bear the burden of the people,
c15044	so that you do not have to bear it by yourself.
c15045	And say to the people:
c15046	Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow,
c15047	and you will eat meat,
c15048	because you have cried out in the hearing of the LORD,
c15049	saying,
c15050	‘Who will feed us meat?
c15051	For we were better off in Egypt.’
c15052	Therefore the LORD will give you meat,
c15053	and you will eat.
c15054	You will eat it not for one
c15055	or two days,
c15056	nor for five
c15057	or ten
c15058	or twenty days,
c15059	but for a whole month—
c15060	until it comes out of your nostrils
c15061	and makes you nauseous—
c15062	because you have despised the LORD
c15063	who is among you,
c15064	and cried out before Him
c15065	saying,
c15066	‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?’”
c15067	But Moses replied,
c15068	600,000 men on foot,
c15069	“Here I am among
c15070	yet You say,
c15071	‘I will give them meat,
c15072	and they will eat for a month.’
c15073	If flocks and herds were slaughtered for them,
c15074	would they have enough?
c15075	Or if all the fish in the sea were caught for them,
c15076	would they have enough?”
c15077	The LORD answered Moses,
c15078	“Is the LORD’s arm too short?
c15079	Now you will see
c15080	My word shall come to pass.”
c15081	whether or not
c15082	So Moses went out
c15083	and relayed to the people the words of the LORD,
c15084	and he gathered seventy of the elders of the people
c15085	and had them stand around the tent.
c15086	Then the LORD came down in the cloud
c15087	and spoke to him,
c15088	and He took some of the Spirit
c15089	that was on [Moses]
c15090	and placed that Spirit on the seventy elders.
c15092	As the Spirit rested on them,
c15093	they prophesied—
c15094	but they never did so again.
c15095	Two men, however, had remained in the camp—
c15096	one named Eldad
c15097	and the other Medad—
c15098	and the Spirit rested on them.
c15099	They were among those listed,
c15100	but they had not gone out to the tent,
c15101	and they prophesied in the camp.
c15102	A young man ran
c15103	and reported to Moses,
c15105	“Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
c15106	Joshua son of Nun, the attendant to Moses since youth, spoke up
c15107	and said,
c15108	“Moses, my lord,
c15109	stop them!”
c15110	But Moses replied,
c15111	“Are you jealous
c15112	on my account? I wish that
c15113	all the LORD’s people were prophets
c15114	and that the LORD would place His Spirit on them!”
c15115	Then Moses returned to the camp, along with the elders of Israel.
c15116	Now a wind sent by the LORD came up,
c15117	drove in quail from the sea,
c15118	and dropped them near the camp, about two cubits deep for a day’s journey in every direction around the camp.
c15119	All that day and night, and all the next day, the people stayed up
c15120	gathering the quail.
c15121	No one gathered less than ten homers,
c15122	and they spread them out all around the camp.
c15123	the meat
c15124	But while ... was still between their teeth,
c15125	before it was chewed,
c15126	the LORD’s anger burned against the people,
c15127	and the LORD struck them with a severe plague.
c15128	So they called that place Kibroth-hattaavah,
c15129	because there they buried the people who had craved other food.
c15130	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people moved on to Hazeroth,
c15131	where they remained for some time.
c15132	Then Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because of the Cushite woman
c15133	he had married,
c15134	for he had taken a Cushite wife.
c15135	they said.
c15136	“Does the LORD speak only through Moses?”
c15137	“Does He not also speak through us?”
c15138	And the LORD heard this.
c15139	Now Moses was a very humble man, more so than any man
c15140	on the face of the earth.
c15141	And suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, ... to
c15142	“You three, come out ... the Tent of Meeting.”
c15143	So the three went out,
c15144	and the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud,
c15145	stood at the entrance to the Tent,
c15146	and summoned Aaron and Miriam.
c15147	When both of them had stepped forward,
c15148	He said,
c15149	“Hear now My words:
c15150	If there is a prophet [among you],
c15151	[I], the LORD,
c15152	will reveal Myself to him in a vision,
c15153	I will speak to him in a dream;
c15154	not so with My servant Moses;
c15155	he is faithful in all My house.
c15156	I speak with him face to face,
c15157	clearly
c15158	and not in riddles;
c15159	he sees the form of the LORD.
c15160	Why then were you unafraid
c15161	to speak against My servant Moses?”
c15162	So the anger of the LORD burned against them,
c15163	and He departed.
c15164	As the cloud lifted from above the Tent,
c15165	suddenly
c15166	Miriam [became] leprous, [white] as snow.
c15167	Aaron turned toward her,
c15168	saw that she [was] leprous,
c15169	and said to Moses,
c15170	“My lord,
c15171	please do not hold against us this sin
c15172	we have so foolishly
c15173	committed.
c15174	Please do not let her be like a stillborn infant
c15175	whose ... when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”
c15176	flesh is half consumed
c15177	So Moses cried out to the LORD,
c15179	“O God, please
c15180	heal her!”
c15181	But the LORD answered Moses,
c15182	“If her father had but spit in her face,
c15183	would she not have been in disgrace for seven days?
c15184	Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days;
c15185	after that she may be brought back in.”
c15186	So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days,
c15187	and the people did not move on
c15188	until [she] was brought in again.
c15189	After that, the people set out from Hazeroth
c15190	and camped in the Wilderness of Paran.
c15191	And the LORD said to Moses,
c15193	“Send
c15194	to spy out the land of Canaan,
c15195	which I am giving to the Israelites.
c15196	men ... of their fathers' tribes send one man
c15197	From each ... who is a leader among them.”
c15198	So at the command of the LORD, Moses sent them out from the wilderness of Paran.
c15199	All the men
c15200	were leaders of the Israelites,
c15201	and these were their names:
c15202	From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur;
c15203	from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;
c15204	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
c15205	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;
c15206	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;
c15207	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;
c15208	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;
c15209	from the tribe ... of Joseph),
c15210	of Manasseh (a tribe ... Gaddi son of Susi;
c15211	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;
c15212	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;
c15213	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;
c15214	[and] from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi.
c15215	These were the names of the men
c15216	Moses sent
c15217	to spy out the land;
c15218	and Moses gave to Hoshea son of Nun {the name} Joshua.
c15219	When Moses sent them
c15220	to spy out the land of Canaan,
c15221	he told them,
c15222	“Go up through the Negev,
c15223	and into the hill country.
c15224	See ... the land
c15225	what ... is like
c15226	and whether its people
c15228	are strong
c15229	or weak,
c15230	few
c15231	or many.
c15232	Is the land
c15233	where they live
c15234	good
c15235	or bad?
c15236	Are the cities
c15237	where they dwell
c15238	open camps
c15239	or fortifications?
c15240	Is the soil
c15241	fertile
c15242	or unproductive?
c15243	Are there trees in it
c15244	or not?
c15245	Be courageous,
c15246	and bring back some of the fruit of the land.”
c15247	(It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)
c15248	So they went up
c15249	and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob,
c15250	toward Lebo-hamath.
c15251	They went up through the Negev
c15252	and came to Hebron,
c15253	where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak,
c15254	dwelled. It had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.
c15255	When they came to the Valley of Eshcol,
c15256	they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes,
c15257	which they carried on a pole between two men.
c15258	They also took some pomegranates and figs.
c15259	Because of the cluster ... that place was called the Valley of Eshcol.
c15260	of grapes the Israelites cut there,
c15261	[the men] returned
c15262	from spying out the land,
c15263	After forty days
c15264	and they went back
c15265	to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh.
c15266	They brought back a report for all the congregation
c15267	and showed them the fruit of the land.
c15268	And they gave this account to [Moses]:
c15270	“We went into the land
c15271	to which you sent us,
c15272	and indeed, it is flowing with milk and honey.
c15273	Here is some of its fruit!
c15274	Nevertheless, the people ... are strong,
c15275	living in the land
c15276	and the cities are large and fortified.
c15277	We even saw the descendants of Anak there.
c15278	The Amalekites live in the land of the Negev;
c15279	the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country;
c15280	and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan.”
c15281	Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses
c15282	and said,
c15283	“We must go up
c15284	and take possession of [the land],
c15285	for we can certainly conquer it!”
c15286	But the men
c15287	who had gone up with him
c15288	replied,
c15289	“We cannot
c15290	go up against the people,
c15291	for they are stronger than we are!”
c15292	So they gave ... a bad report about the land
c15293	they had spied out:
c15294	the Israelites
c15296	“The land
c15297	we explored
c15300	devours its inhabitants,
c15302	and all the people
c15303	we saw there
c15304	are great in stature.
c15305	We even saw the Nephilim there— the descendants of Anak that come from the Nephilim!
c15306	We seemed like grasshoppers in our own sight,
c15307	and we must have seemed the same to them!”
c15308	Then the whole congregation lifted
c15309	up their voices and cried out,
c15310	and that night the people wept.
c15311	All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron,
c15312	and the whole congregation said to them,
c15313	“If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or ... in this wilderness!
c15314	if only we had died
c15315	Why is the LORD bringing us into this land
c15316	to fall by the sword?
c15317	Our wives and children will become plunder.
c15318	Would it not be better
c15319	for us to go back to Egypt?”
c15320	So they said
c15321	to one another,
c15322	“Let us appoint a leader
c15323	and return to Egypt.”
c15324	Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown before the entire assembled congregation of Israel.
c15325	Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh,
c15326	who were among those who had spied out the land,
c15327	tore their clothes
c15328	and said to the whole congregation of Israel,
c15330	“The land
c15331	we passed through
c15332	and explored
c15333	[is] an exceedingly good land.
c15334	If the LORD is pleased with us,
c15335	He will bring us into this land,
c15336	and He will give it to us.
c15337	a land
c15338	flowing with milk and honey,
c15339	Only do not rebel against the LORD,
c15340	and do not be afraid of the people of the land,
c15341	for they will be like bread for us.
c15342	Their protection has been removed,
c15343	and the LORD is with us.
c15344	Do not be afraid of them!”
c15345	But the entire congregation threatened
c15346	to stone [Joshua and Caleb].
c15347	Then the glory of the LORD appeared to all the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting.
c15348	And the LORD said to Moses,
c15349	“How long will this people treat Me with contempt?
c15350	How long will they refuse to believe in Me, despite all the signs
c15351	I have performed among them?
c15352	I will strike them with a plague
c15353	and destroy them—
c15354	and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.”
c15355	But Moses said to the LORD,
c15356	“The Egyptians will hear
c15357	of it, for by Your strength You brought this people from among them.
c15358	And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.
c15359	They have already heard
c15360	that You,
c15361	O LORD,
c15362	are in the midst of this people,
c15363	that ... have been seen face to face,
c15364	You, O LORD,
c15365	[that] Your cloud stands over them,
c15366	and [that] You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day
c15367	and a pillar of fire by night.
c15368	If You kill this people as one man,
c15369	the nations ... will say,
c15370	who have heard of Your fame
c15372	‘Because the LORD was unable
c15373	to bring this people into the land
c15374	He swore to give them,
c15375	He has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’
c15376	So now
c15377	I pray, may the power of the Lord be magnified,
c15378	just as You have declared:
c15380	‘The LORD is slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion,
c15381	forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion.
c15382	But He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished;
c15383	He visits the iniquity of the fathers upon their children to the third and fourth generation.’
c15384	Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people, in keeping with the greatness of Your loving devotion,
c15385	just as You have forgiven [them] ever since [they left] Egypt.”
c15386	the LORD replied.
c15387	“I have pardoned them as you requested,”
c15388	“Yet as surely as I live
c15389	and as surely as the whole earth is filled with the glory of the LORD,
c15390	[not one] of the men
c15391	who have seen My glory and the signs
c15392	I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness—
c15393	yet have tested Me ... these ten times—
c15394	and disobeyed Me
c15395	not one will ever see the land
c15396	I swore to give their fathers.
c15397	None of those who have treated Me with contempt will see it.
c15398	My servant Caleb
c15399	But because ... has a different spirit
c15400	and has followed Me wholeheartedly,
c15401	I will bring him into the land
c15402	he has entered,
c15403	and his descendants will inherit it.
c15404	Now since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys,
c15405	turn back tomorrow
c15406	and head for the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea.”
c15407	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c15409	“How long will this wicked congregation
c15410	grumble against ... that
c15411	Me? ... the complaints ... the Israelites
c15412	{are making} against Me.
c15413	I have heard
c15414	So tell them:
c15415	As surely as I live,
c15416	declares the LORD,
c15417	exactly
c15418	as I heard you say.
c15419	I will do to you
c15420	Your bodies will fall in this wilderness— all who were numbered in the census, everyone twenty years of age or older—
c15421	because you have grumbled against Me.
c15422	Surely none of you will enter the land
c15423	in which I swore
c15424	to settle you,
c15425	except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
c15426	But I will bring your children,
c15427	whom you said
c15428	would become plunder,
c15429	into
c15430	the land ... and they will enjoy it.
c15431	you have rejected—
c15432	But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness.
c15433	Your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years,
c15434	and they will suffer [for] your unfaithfulness
c15435	until the last of your bodies lie scattered in the wilderness.
c15436	In keeping with the ... of days
c15437	you spied out the land,
c15438	forty ... you shall bear your guilt forty years— a year for each day—
c15439	and you will experience My alienation.
c15440	I, the LORD, have spoken,
c15441	and I will surely do these things to this entire wicked congregation,
c15442	which has conspired against Me.
c15443	They will meet their end in the wilderness,
c15444	and there they will die.”
c15445	So the men
c15446	Moses had sent ... and who
c15447	to spy out the land,
c15448	had returned
c15449	and made all the congregation grumble against him
c15450	by bringing a bad report about the land—
c15451	were struck down
c15452	those men who had spread the bad report about the land
c15453	by a plague before the LORD.
c15454	Of those men ... only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh remained alive.
c15455	who had gone
c15456	to spy out the land,
c15457	And when Moses relayed these words to all the Israelites,
c15458	the people mourned greatly.
c15459	Early the next morning they got up
c15460	and went up toward the ridge of the hill country.
c15461	they said,
c15462	“We have indeed
c15463	“but we will go to the place
c15464	the LORD has promised.”
c15465	sinned,”
c15466	But Moses said,
c15467	“Why are you transgressing the commandment of the LORD?
c15468	This will not succeed!
c15469	Do not go up,
c15470	because the LORD is not among you.
c15471	lest you be struck down by your enemies,
c15472	For there the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you,
c15473	and you will fall by the sword.
c15474	Because you have turned away from the LORD,
c15475	[He] will not be with you.”
c15476	But they dared
c15477	to go up to the ridge of the hill country,
c15478	though neither Moses [nor] the ark of the covenant of the LORD moved from the camp.
c15479	Then the Amalekites and Canaanites ... came down,
c15480	who lived in that part of the hill country
c15481	attacked them,
c15482	and routed them all the way to Hormah.
c15483	Then the LORD instructed Moses,
c15485	“Speak to the Israelites
c15486	and tell them:
c15487	After you enter the land ... to settle
c15488	I am giving you
c15489	and you present an offering made by fire to the LORD ... either a burnt offering or a sacrifice
c15490	to fulfill a vow
c15491	or as a freewill or festival offering—
c15492	to produce a pleasing aroma to the LORD—
c15493	from the herd or flock
c15494	then the one presenting
c15495	his offering to the LORD shall also present
c15496	a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour
c15497	mixed with a quarter hin of oil.
c15498	With the burnt offering or sacrifice of each lamb, prepare a quarter hin of wine as a drink offering.
c15499	With a ram you are to prepare a grain offering of two-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour
c15500	mixed with a third of a hin of oil,
c15501	[and] a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering,
c15502	a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c15503	When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice
c15504	to fulfill a vow
c15505	or as a peace offering to the LORD,
c15506	present with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour
c15507	mixed with half a hin of oil.
c15508	Also present half a hin of wine as a drink offering.
c15509	It is an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c15510	This is to be done for each bull, ram, lamb, or goat.
c15511	many.
c15512	you must prepare ... no matter how
c15513	This is how ... each one,
c15514	Everyone who is native-born shall prepare these things in this way
c15515	when he presents an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c15516	if a foreigner residing with
c15517	And for the generations to come, ... you or someone else among you
c15518	wants to prepare an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the LORD,
c15519	he is to do exactly as
c15520	you do.
c15521	The assembly
c15522	is to have the same statute for both you and the foreign resident;
c15523	it is a permanent statute for the generations to come.
c15524	You and the foreigner shall be the same before the LORD.
c15525	The same law and the same ordinance will apply both to you and the foreigner
c15526	residing with you.”
c15527	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c15529	“Speak to the Israelites
c15530	and tell them:
c15531	When you enter the land
c15532	to which I am bringing you
c15534	and you eat the food of the land,
c15535	you shall lift up an offering to the LORD.
c15536	From the first of your dough, you are to lift up a cake as a contribution;
c15537	offer it just like an offering from the threshing floor.
c15538	Throughout your generations, you are to give the LORD an offering from the first of your dough.
c15539	Now if you sin unintentionally
c15540	and do not obey all these commandments
c15541	that the LORD has spoken to Moses—
c15542	all
c15543	that the LORD has commanded you through Moses from the day
c15544	the LORD gave them
c15545	and continuing through the generations to come—
c15547	and if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge of the congregation,
c15548	then the whole congregation is to prepare one young bull as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD,
c15549	with its grain offering and drink offering according to the regulation,
c15550	and one male goat as a sin offering.
c15551	The priest is to make atonement for the entire congregation of Israel,
c15552	so that they may be forgiven;
c15553	for the sin was unintentional,
c15554	and they have brought to the LORD an offering made by fire
c15555	and a sin offering, [presented] before the LORD for their unintentional sin.
c15556	The entire congregation of Israel and the foreigners ... will be forgiven,
c15557	residing among them
c15558	since it happened to all the people unintentionally.
c15559	Also, if one person sins unintentionally,
c15560	he is to present a year-old female goat as a sin offering.
c15561	And the priest shall make atonement ... on behalf of the person
c15562	before the LORD ... who erred by sinning unintentionally;
c15563	and when atonement has been made for him,
c15564	he will be forgiven.
c15565	You ... whether he is an Israelite or a foreigner
c15566	residing among you.
c15567	shall have the same law
c15568	for the one who acts in error,
c15569	But the person
c15570	who sins defiantly,
c15571	whether a native or foreigner,
c15572	blasphemes the LORD. That
c15573	person shall be cut off from his people.
c15574	because he has despised the word of the LORD
c15575	and broken His commandment;
c15576	He shall certainly be cut off,
c15577	his guilt remains on him.”
c15578	While the Israelites were in the wilderness,
c15579	a man was found
c15580	gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
c15581	brought
c15582	Those who found [the man]
c15583	gathering wood
c15584	him to Moses, Aaron, and the entire congregation,
c15585	they placed him in custody.
c15586	and because it had not been declared
c15587	what should be done to him,
c15588	And the LORD said to Moses,
c15589	“The man must surely be put to death.
c15590	The entire congregation is to stone him outside the camp.”
c15591	So the whole congregation took [the man] outside the camp
c15592	and stoned
c15593	him to death,
c15594	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c15595	Later, the LORD said to Moses,
c15597	“Speak to the Israelites
c15598	and tell them that
c15599	throughout the generations to come they are to make for themselves tassels for the corners of their garments,
c15600	with a blue cord on each tassel.
c15601	These will serve as tassels
c15602	for you to look at,
c15603	so that you may remember all the commandments of the LORD,
c15604	that you may obey them
c15605	and not ... by following your own heart and your own eyes.
c15606	prostitute yourselves
c15607	Then you will remember
c15608	and obey all My commandments,
c15609	and you will be holy to your God.
c15610	I am the LORD your God
c15611	who brought you out of the land of Egypt
c15612	to be your God.
c15613	I am the LORD your God.”
c15614	Now Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath son of Levi, along with some Reubenites— Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth— conducted
c15615	a rebellion against Moses,
c15616	along with 250 men of Israel renowned as leaders of the congregation and representatives in the assembly.
c15617	They came together against Moses and Aaron
c15618	and told them,
c15619	“You have gone too far!
c15620	Everyone ... congregation
c15621	in the entire ... is holy,
c15622	and the LORD is in their midst.
c15623	Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?”
c15624	When Moses heard this,
c15625	he fell facedown.
c15626	Then he said to Korah and all his followers,
c15628	“Tomorrow morning
c15629	the LORD will reveal
c15630	who belongs to Him
c15631	and who is holy,
c15632	and He will bring that person near to Himself.
c15634	The one He chooses
c15635	He will bring near to Himself.
c15636	are to do as follows:
c15637	Take censers,
c15638	You, Korah, and all your followers
c15639	you are to place fire ... in them
c15640	and tomorrow ... and incense ... in the presence of the LORD.
c15641	will be
c15642	Then the man
c15643	the LORD chooses
c15644	the one who is holy.
c15645	who have gone too far!”
c15646	It is you sons of Levi
c15647	Moses also said to Korah,
c15648	“Now listen,
c15649	you sons of Levi!
c15650	Is it not enough for
c15651	you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel
c15652	and brought you near to Himself
c15653	to perform the work at the LORD’s tabernacle
c15654	and to stand before the congregation
c15655	to minister to them?
c15656	He has brought you near, [you] and all your fellow Levites,
c15657	but you are seeking the priesthood as well.
c15658	Therefore, it is you and all your followers
c15659	who have conspired against the LORD!
c15660	As for Aaron,
c15661	who is he
c15662	that you should grumble against him?”
c15663	Then Moses summoned
c15664	Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab,
c15665	but they said,
c15666	“We will not come!
c15667	Is it not enough
c15668	that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey
c15669	to kill us in the wilderness?
c15670	Must you also appoint yourself as ruler over us?
c15671	Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey
c15672	or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards.
c15673	Will you gouge out the eyes of these men?
c15674	No, we will not come!”
c15675	Then Moses became very angry
c15676	and said to the LORD,
c15677	“Do not regard their offering.
c15678	I have not taken one donkey from them
c15679	or mistreated a single one of them.”
c15680	So Moses told Korah,
c15681	“You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow— you and they and Aaron.
c15682	Each man is to take his censer,
c15683	place incense in it,
c15684	and present [it] before the LORD— 250 censers [in all].
c15685	You and Aaron are to present your censers as well.”
c15686	So each man took his censer,
c15687	put fire
c15688	and incense in it,
c15689	and stood ... at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c15690	with Moses and Aaron
c15691	When Korah had gathered his whole assembly against them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
c15692	the glory of the LORD appeared to the whole congregation.
c15693	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c15695	“Separate yourselves from this congregation
c15696	so that I may consume them in an instant.”
c15697	But Moses and Aaron fell facedown
c15698	and said,
c15699	“O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh,
c15700	when one man sins,
c15701	will You vent Your wrath on the whole congregation?”
c15702	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c15704	“Tell the congregation
c15706	to move away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”
c15707	So Moses got up
c15708	and went to Dathan and Abiram,
c15709	and the elders of Israel followed him.
c15710	And he warned the congregation,
c15712	“Move away now from the tents of these wicked men.
c15713	Do not touch anything
c15714	that belongs to them,
c15715	or you will be swept away because of all their sins.”
c15716	So they moved away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Meanwhile,
c15717	Dathan and Abiram had come out
c15718	and stood at the entrance of their tents
c15719	with their wives and children and infants.
c15720	Then Moses said,
c15721	“This is how you will know
c15722	that the LORD has sent me
c15723	to do all these things,
c15724	for it was not my own doing:
c15725	If these men die a natural death,
c15726	or if they suffer the fate of all men,
c15727	then the LORD has not sent me.
c15728	But if the LORD brings about something unprecedented,
c15729	and the earth opens its mouth
c15730	and swallows them and all
c15731	that belongs to them
c15732	so that they go down alive into Sheol,
c15733	then you will know
c15734	that these men have treated the LORD {with contempt}.”
c15736	As soon as [Moses] had finished
c15737	saying all this,
c15738	the ground ... split open,
c15739	beneath them
c15740	and the earth opened its mouth
c15741	and swallowed them and their households, all ... men
c15742	Korah’s
c15743	and all their possessions.
c15744	They went down ... with all
c15745	they owned.
c15746	alive into Sheol
c15747	The earth closed over them,
c15748	and they vanished from the assembly.
c15749	all the people of Israel
c15750	who [were] around them
c15751	At their cries, ... fled,
c15752	saying,
c15753	“The earth may swallow us too!”
c15754	And fire came forth from the LORD
c15755	and consumed the 250 men
c15756	who were offering the incense.
c15757	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c15759	“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest
c15760	to remove the censers from the flames,
c15761	and to scatter the coals far away.
c15762	because they are holy,
c15763	As for the censers of those who sinned at the cost of their own lives,
c15764	hammer them into sheets to overlay the altar,
c15765	for these were presented before the LORD,
c15766	and so have become holy.
c15767	They will serve as a sign to the Israelites.”
c15768	So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers
c15769	brought by those who had been burned up,
c15770	and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,
c15771	This was to be a reminder for the Israelites
c15772	just as ... that no outsider ... should approach
c15773	who is not a descendant of Aaron
c15774	the LORD ... to offer incense before
c15775	lest he become like Korah and his followers.
c15776	commanded him through Moses. ... the LORD,
c15777	The next day the entire congregation of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron,
c15778	saying,
c15779	“You have killed the LORD’s people!”
c15780	But
c15781	when the congregation gathered against them, Moses and Aaron
c15782	turned toward the Tent of Meeting,
c15783	and suddenly the cloud covered it
c15784	and the glory of the LORD appeared.
c15785	Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting,
c15786	and the LORD said to Moses,
c15788	“Get away from this congregation
c15789	so that I may consume them in an instant.”
c15790	And they fell facedown.
c15791	Moses said to Aaron, ... to
c15792	“Take your censer,
c15793	place fire from the altar in it,
c15794	and add incense.
c15795	Go quickly ... the congregation
c15796	and make atonement for them,
c15797	because wrath has come out from the LORD;
c15798	the plague has begun.”
c15799	So Aaron took [the censer]
c15800	as Moses had ordered
c15801	and ran into the middle of the assembly.
c15802	And seeing that the plague had begun among the people,
c15803	he offered the incense
c15804	and made atonement for the people.
c15805	He stood between the living and the dead,
c15806	and the plague was halted.
c15808	But those who died from the plague
c15809	numbered 14,700,
c15810	in addition to those who had died on account of Korah.
c15811	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
c15812	since the plague had been halted.
c15813	And the LORD said to Moses,
c15815	“Speak to the Israelites
c15816	and take from them ... staffs, [one]
c15817	twelve ... from the leader of each tribe. ... his staff,
c15818	Write each man’s name on
c15819	and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi,
c15820	because there must be one staff for the head of each tribe.
c15821	Place [the staffs] in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony,
c15822	where I meet with you.
c15824	belonging to the man
c15825	I choose
c15826	The staff ... will sprout,
c15827	and I will rid Myself of the constant grumbling of the Israelites
c15828	against you.”
c15829	So Moses spoke to the Israelites,
c15830	and each of their leaders gave him a staff— one for each of the leaders of their tribes, twelve staffs in all.
c15831	And Aaron’s staff was among [them].
c15832	Then Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony.
c15833	The next day
c15834	Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony
c15835	and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted,
c15836	put forth buds,
c15837	blossomed,
c15838	and produced almonds!
c15839	Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD's presence to all the Israelites.
c15840	They saw them,
c15841	and each man took his own staff.
c15842	The LORD said to Moses,
c15843	“Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebellious,
c15844	so that you may put an end to their grumbling against Me,
c15845	lest they die.”
c15846	So Moses did
c15847	as the LORD had commanded him.
c15849	Then the Israelites declared to Moses,
c15851	“Look, we are perishing!
c15852	We are lost;
c15853	we are all lost!
c15854	Anyone
c15855	who comes near
c15856	the tabernacle of the LORD
c15857	will die.
c15858	Are we all
c15859	going to perish?”
c15860	The LORD said to Aaron,
c15861	“You, your sons, and your father’s house must bear the iniquity against the sanctuary.
c15862	And you and your sons [alone] must bear the iniquity against the priesthood.
c15863	But bring with you also your brothers from the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father,
c15864	that they may join you
c15865	and assist
c15866	you and your sons before the Tent of the Testimony.
c15867	And they shall attend to your duties and all the duties of the Tent;
c15868	but they must not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar,
c15869	or both they and you will die.
c15870	They are to join you
c15871	and attend to the obligations of the Tent of Meeting, doing all the work at the Tent;
c15872	but no outsider may come near you.
c15873	So you shall attend to the obligations of the sanctuary [and] of the altar,
c15874	that wrath may not fall on the Israelites again.
c15875	I Myself
c15876	Behold, ... have selected your fellow Levites from the Israelites
c15877	as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD
c15878	to perform the service for the Tent of Meeting.
c15879	But only you and your sons shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar, and for what is inside the veil,
c15880	and you are to perform that service.
c15881	I am giving you the work of the priesthood as a gift,
c15882	but any outsider
c15883	who comes near [the sanctuary]
c15884	must be put to death.”
c15885	Then the LORD said to Aaron,
c15886	I
c15887	“Behold, ... have put you in charge of My offerings.
c15888	As for all the sacred offerings of the Israelites,
c15889	I have given them to you ... as a portion
c15890	and your sons ... and a permanent statute.
c15891	A portion of the most holy offerings [reserved] from the fire will be yours.
c15892	From all the offerings ... whether grain offerings, sin offerings, or guilt offerings,
c15893	that they give Me,
c15894	it shall be most holy
c15895	to you and your sons.
c15896	You are to eat it as most holy.
c15897	Every male may eat it;
c15898	it shall be holy to you.
c15899	And this is yours as well: the offering of their gifts, along with all the wave offerings of the Israelites.
c15900	I have given this to you
c15901	and your sons and daughters as a permanent statute.
c15902	Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat it.
c15903	all the freshest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain ... as their firstfruits.
c15904	I give you ... that ... to the LORD
c15905	the Israelites give
c15906	The firstfruits of all
c15907	that is in their land,
c15908	which they bring to the LORD,
c15909	belong to you.
c15910	Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat them.
c15911	Every devoted thing in Israel belongs to you.
c15912	The firstborn of every womb,
c15913	whether man or beast, that is offered to the LORD
c15914	belongs to you.
c15915	But you must surely redeem every firstborn son
c15916	[and] every firstborn male of unclean animals.
c15917	You are to pay the redemption price for a month-old male according to your valuation: five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel,
c15918	which is twenty gerahs.
c15919	But you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox, a sheep, or a goat;
c15920	they are holy.
c15921	You are to sprinkle their blood on the altar
c15922	and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c15923	And their meat belongs to you,
c15924	just as the breast and right thigh of the wave offering belong to you.
c15925	All the holy offerings
c15926	that the Israelites present to the LORD
c15927	I give to you and to your sons and daughters as a permanent statute.
c15928	It is a permanent covenant of salt before the LORD for you and your offspring.”
c15929	Then the LORD said to Aaron,
c15930	“You will have no inheritance in their land,
c15931	nor will you have any portion among them.
c15932	I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites.
c15933	to the Levites
c15934	Behold, I have given ... all the tithes in Israel as an inheritance in return for the work
c15935	they do, the service of the Tent of Meeting.
c15936	No longer may the Israelites come near the Tent of Meeting,
c15937	or they will incur guilt
c15938	and die.
c15939	The Levites are to perform the work of the Tent of Meeting,
c15940	and they must bear their iniquity.
c15941	This is a permanent statute for the generations to come.
c15942	The Levites will not receive an inheritance among the Israelites.
c15943	For ... the tenth ... the Israelites
c15944	that ... present to the LORD as a contribution.
c15945	I have given the Levites as their inheritance
c15946	That is why I told
c15947	them that they would not receive an inheritance among the Israelites.”
c15948	And the LORD instructed Moses,
c15950	“Speak to the Levites
c15951	and tell them:
c15952	When you receive from the Israelites the tithe
c15953	that I have given you as your inheritance,
c15954	you must present part of it as an offering to the LORD— a tenth of the tenth.
c15955	Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress.
c15956	So you are to present an offering to the LORD from every tenth
c15957	you receive from the Israelites,
c15958	and from it give the LORD’s offering to Aaron the priest.
c15959	You must present the offering due the LORD ... all ... of every gift,
c15960	from ... the best ... the holiest part of it.
c15961	Therefore say to [the Levites]:
c15962	Once you have presented the best part
c15963	,it will be reckoned [to you] as the produce of the threshing floor or the winepress.
c15964	And you and your households may eat [the rest of it] anywhere;
c15965	it is the compensation for your work at the Tent of Meeting.
c15966	you will not incur guilt because of it.
c15967	Once you have presented the best part of it,
c15968	But you must not defile the sacred offerings of the Israelites,
c15969	lest you die.”
c15970	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c15972	“This is the statute of the law
c15973	that the LORD has commanded:
c15975	Instruct the Israelites
c15976	to bring you an unblemished red heifer
c15977	that has no defect
c15978	and has never been placed under a yoke.
c15979	Give it to Eleazar the priest,
c15980	and he will have it brought outside the camp
c15981	and slaughtered in his presence.
c15982	Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger
c15983	and sprinkle [it] seven times toward the front of the Tent of Meeting.
c15984	Then the heifer must be burned in his sight.
c15985	Its hide, its flesh, and its blood are to be burned, along with its dung.
c15986	The priest is to take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool
c15987	and throw them onto the burning heifer.
c15988	Then the priest must wash his clothes
c15989	and bathe his body in water;
c15990	after that he may enter the camp,
c15991	but he will be ceremonially unclean until evening.
c15993	The one who burned [the heifer]
c15994	must also wash his clothes ... in water,
c15995	and bathe his body
c15996	and he too will be unclean until evening.
c15997	Then a man who is clean is to gather up the ashes of the heifer
c15998	and store [them] in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp.
c15999	They must be kept by the congregation of Israel for preparing the water of purification;
c16000	this [is] for purification from sin.
c16001	must also wash
c16002	The man who has gathered up the ashes of the heifer
c16003	his clothes,
c16004	and he will be unclean until evening.
c16005	This ... for the Israelites and for the foreigner
c16006	residing among them.
c16007	is a permanent statute
c16008	Whoever touches any dead body
c16009	will be unclean for seven days.
c16010	He must purify himself with the water on the third day
c16011	and the seventh day; then he will be clean.
c16012	But if he does not purify himself on the third ... days,
c16013	and seventh ... he will not be clean.
c16014	Anyone
c16015	who touches a corpse, the body of a person
c16016	who has died,
c16017	and does not purify
c16018	himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD.
c16019	That person must be cut off from Israel.
c16020	because the water of purification has not been sprinkled on him,
c16021	He remains unclean,
c16022	and his uncleanness is still on him.
c16023	This is the law
c16024	a person
c16025	when ... dies in a tent:
c16026	Everyone
c16027	who enters the tent
c16028	and everyone
c16029	already in the tent
c16030	will be unclean for seven days,
c16031	and any open container
c16032	without a lid fastened on it
c16033	is unclean.
c16034	Anyone
c16035	in the open field who touches someone who has been killed by the sword or has died of natural causes, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave,
c16036	will be unclean for seven days.
c16037	[For the purification] of the unclean person, take some of the ashes of the burnt purification offering,
c16038	put them in a jar, and pour fresh running water over them.
c16039	is to take some hyssop,
c16040	Then a man who is ceremonially clean ... dip it in the water,
c16041	and sprinkle the tent, all the furnishings, and the people
c16042	who were there.
c16043	He is also to sprinkle the one who touched the bone, grave, corpse, or person who had been killed.
c16044	The man who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third day and the seventh day.
c16045	After he purifies the unclean person on the seventh day,
c16046	[the one being cleansed] must wash his clothes
c16047	and bathe in water,
c16048	and he will be clean by evening.
c16049	But if a person
c16050	who is unclean
c16051	does not purify
c16052	himself, [he] will be cut off from the assembly,
c16053	because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD.
c16054	The water of [purification] has not been sprinkled on him;
c16055	he is unclean.
c16056	This is a permanent statute for [the people]:
c16057	The one who sprinkles the water of [purification] must wash his clothes,
c16059	and whoever touches the water of [purification]
c16060	will be unclean until evening.
c16061	Anything
c16062	the unclean person touches
c16063	will become unclean,
c16064	and anyone
c16065	who touches it
c16066	will be unclean until evening.”
c16067	In the first month, the whole congregation of Israel entered the Wilderness of Zin
c16068	[and] stayed in Kadesh.
c16069	There Miriam died
c16070	and was buried.
c16071	Now there was no water for the congregation,
c16072	so they gathered against Moses and Aaron.
c16073	The people quarreled with Moses
c16074	and said,
c16076	“If only we had perished
c16077	when our brothers fell dead before the LORD.
c16078	Why have you brought the LORD’s assembly into this wilderness
c16079	for us and our livestock to die here?
c16080	Why have you led us up out of Egypt
c16081	to bring us to this wretched place?
c16082	It is not a place of grain, figs, vines, and pomegranates,
c16083	and there is no water
c16084	to drink!”
c16085	Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
c16086	They fell facedown,
c16087	and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.
c16088	And the LORD said to Moses,
c16090	“Take the staff
c16091	and assemble the congregation. You and your brother Aaron
c16092	are to speak to the rock while they watch,
c16093	and it will pour out its water.
c16094	You will bring out water from the rock
c16095	and provide drink for the congregation and their livestock.”
c16096	So Moses took the staff from the LORD’s presence,
c16097	just as He had commanded.
c16098	Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock,
c16099	and Moses said to them,
c16100	“Listen now,
c16101	you rebels,
c16102	must we bring you water out of this rock?”
c16103	Then Moses raised his hand
c16104	and struck the rock twice with his staff,
c16105	so that a great amount of water gushed out,
c16106	and the congregation and their livestock were able to drink.
c16107	But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, ... into
c16108	“Because you did not trust Me
c16109	to show My holiness in the sight of the Israelites,
c16110	you will not bring this assembly ... the land
c16111	I have given them.”
c16112	These were the waters of Meribah,
c16113	where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD,
c16114	and He showed His holiness among them.
c16115	From Kadesh Moses sent messengers to [tell] the king of Edom,
c16116	“This is what your brother Israel says:
c16117	You know all the hardship
c16118	that has befallen us,
c16119	how our fathers went down to Egypt,
c16120	where we lived many years.
c16121	The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers,
c16122	and when we cried out to the LORD,
c16123	He heard our voice,
c16124	sent an angel,
c16125	and brought us out of Egypt.
c16126	Now look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory.
c16127	Please let us pass through your land.
c16128	We will not cut through any field or vineyard,
c16129	[or] drink water from any well.
c16130	We will stay on the King’s Highway;
c16131	we will not turn to the right or to the left
c16132	until we have passed through your territory.”
c16133	But Edom answered,
c16134	“You may not travel
c16135	through our land, or we will come out ... you with the sword.”
c16136	and confront
c16137	the Israelites replied,
c16138	“We will stay on the main road,”
c16139	“and if we or our herds drink your water,
c16140	we will pay for it.
c16141	There will be no problem; only
c16142	let us pass through on foot.”
c16143	insisted,
c16144	“You may not pass through.”
c16145	But Edom ... And they came out
c16146	to confront [the Israelites]
c16147	with a large army and a strong hand.
c16148	So Edom refused
c16149	to allow Israel
c16150	to pass through their territory,
c16151	and Israel turned away from them.
c16152	After they had set out from Kadesh,
c16153	the entire congregation of Israel came to Mount Hor.
c16154	And at Mount Hor, near the border of the land of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
c16156	“Aaron will be gathered to his people;
c16157	he will not enter the land
c16158	I have given the Israelites,
c16159	because both of you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah.
c16160	Take Aaron and his son Eleazar
c16161	and bring them up Mount Hor.
c16162	Remove Aaron’s priestly garments
c16163	and put them on his son Eleazar.
c16164	Aaron will be gathered [to his people]
c16165	and will die there.”
c16166	So Moses did
c16167	as the LORD had commanded,
c16168	and they climbed Mount Hor in the sight of the whole congregation.
c16169	After Moses had removed Aaron’s garments
c16170	and put them on his son Eleazar,
c16171	Aaron died there on top of the mountain.
c16172	Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
c16173	When all the congregation saw
c16174	that Aaron had died,
c16175	the entire house of Israel mourned for him thirty days.
c16176	When the Canaanite king of Arad, ... heard
c16177	who lived in the Negev,
c16178	that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim,
c16179	he attacked Israel
c16180	and captured some prisoners.
c16181	So Israel made a vow to the LORD:
c16183	“If You will deliver this people into our hands,
c16184	we will completely destroy their cities.”
c16185	And the LORD heard Israel’s plea
c16186	and delivered up the Canaanites.
c16187	Israel completely destroyed them and their cities;
c16188	so they named the place Hormah.
c16189	Then they set out from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea,
c16190	in order to bypass the land of Edom.
c16191	But the people grew impatient on the journey
c16192	and spoke against God and against Moses:
c16193	“Why have you led us up out of Egypt
c16194	to die in the wilderness?
c16195	There is no bread
c16196	or water,
c16197	and we detest this wretched food!”
c16198	So the LORD sent poisonous snakes among the people,
c16199	were bitten
c16200	and many of the Israelites ... and died.
c16201	Then the people came to Moses
c16202	and said,
c16203	“We have sinned
c16204	by speaking against the LORD and against you.
c16205	Intercede with the LORD
c16206	to take the snakes away from us.”
c16207	So Moses interceded for the people.
c16208	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c16209	“Make a snake
c16210	and mount it on a pole.
c16211	When anyone who is bitten
c16212	looks at it,
c16213	he will live.”
c16214	So Moses made a bronze snake
c16215	and mounted it on a pole.
c16217	If anyone who was bitten ... serpent,
c16218	looked at the bronze
c16219	he would recover.
c16220	Then the Israelites set out
c16221	and camped at Oboth.
c16222	They journeyed from Oboth
c16223	and camped at Iye-abarim in the wilderness
c16224	opposite Moab to the east.
c16225	From there they set
c16226	out and camped at Zered Valley.
c16227	From there they moved on
c16228	and camped on the other side of the Arnon,
c16229	in the wilderness
c16230	that extends into the Amorite territory.
c16231	Now the Arnon is the border between the Moabites and the Amorites.
c16232	Therefore it is stated in the Book of the Wars of the LORD:
c16233	“Waheb in Suphah
c16234	and the wadis of the Arnon,
c16235	even the slopes of the wadis
c16236	that extend
c16237	to the site of Ar
c16238	and lie along the border of Moab.”
c16239	From there [they went on] to Beer,
c16240	the well
c16241	where the LORD said to Moses,
c16242	“Gather the people
c16243	so that I may give them water.”
c16244	Then Israel sang this song:
c16245	“Spring up,
c16246	O well,
c16247	all of you sing to it!
c16248	the well;
c16249	The princes dug
c16250	the nobles of the people hollowed it out with their scepters and with their staffs.”
c16251	From the wilderness [the Israelites went on] to Mattanah,
c16252	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel,
c16253	and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
c16254	and from Bamoth to the valley
c16255	[in] Moab
c16256	where the top of Pisgah
c16257	overlooks the wasteland.
c16258	Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites,
c16259	saying,
c16260	“Let us pass through your land.
c16261	We will not cut through any field or vineyard,
c16262	[or] drink water from any well.
c16263	We will stay on the King’s Highway
c16264	until we have passed through your territory.”
c16265	But Sihon would not let Israel
c16266	pass through his territory.
c16267	Instead, he gathered his whole army
c16268	and went out
c16269	to confront Israel
c16270	in the wilderness.
c16271	When he came to Jahaz,
c16272	he fought against Israel.
c16273	And Israel put him to the sword
c16274	and took possession of his land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok— but only up to ... of the Ammonites,
c16275	the border ... because it was fortified.
c16276	Israel captured all the cities
c16277	of the Amorites and occupied [them], including Heshbon and all its villages.
c16278	Heshbon
c16279	was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who
c16280	had fought against the former king of Moab
c16281	and taken all his land as far as the Arnon.
c16282	That is why the poets say:
c16283	“Come
c16284	to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt;
c16285	let the city of Sihon be restored.
c16286	For a fire went out from Heshbon,
c16287	a blaze from the city of Sihon.
c16288	It consumed Ar of Moab,
c16289	the rulers of Arnon’s heights.
c16290	Woe to you,
c16291	O Moab!
c16292	You are destroyed,
c16293	O people of Chemosh!
c16294	He gave up his sons as refugees,
c16295	and his daughters into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.
c16296	But we have overthrown them;
c16297	Heshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon.
c16298	We demolished them as far as Nophah,
c16299	which reaches to Medeba.”
c16300	So Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
c16301	After Moses had sent
c16302	spies to Jazer,
c16303	Israel captured its villages
c16304	and drove out the Amorites
c16305	who were there.
c16306	Then they turned
c16307	and went up the road to Bashan,
c16308	and Og king of Bashan marched out
c16309	against
c16310	them with his whole army to do battle at Edrei.
c16311	But the LORD said to Moses,
c16312	“Do not fear him,
c16313	for I have handed him over to you, with all his people and his land.
c16314	Do
c16315	to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
c16316	who lived in Heshbon.”
c16317	So they struck down [Og], along with his sons and his whole army,
c16318	until no remnant was left.
c16319	And they took possession of his land.
c16320	Then the Israelites traveled on
c16321	and camped in the plains of Moab near the Jordan, across from Jericho.
c16322	Now Balak son of Zippor saw all
c16323	that Israel had done to the Amorites,
c16324	and Moab was terrified of the people
c16325	because they were numerous.
c16326	Indeed, Moab dreaded the Israelites.
c16327	So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian,
c16328	“This horde will devour everything around us,
c16329	as an ox licks up the grass of the field.”
c16330	Since Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time,
c16331	he sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor,
c16332	which is by the Euphrates in the land of his people.
c16333	said Balak.
c16335	“Behold, a people has come out of Egypt,”
c16336	“They cover the face of the land
c16337	and have settled next to me.
c16338	now
c16339	So please come
c16340	and put a curse on these people,
c16341	because they are too mighty for me.
c16342	Perhaps I may be able
c16343	to defeat them
c16344	and drive them out of the land;
c16345	for I know
c16346	that those you bless
c16347	are blessed,
c16349	and those you curse
c16350	are cursed.”
c16351	The elders of Moab and Midian departed
c16352	with the fees for divination in hand.
c16353	They came to Balaam
c16354	and relayed to him the words of Balak.
c16355	[Balaam] replied,
c16356	“Spend the night here,”
c16357	“and I will give you the answer
c16358	the LORD speaks to me.”
c16359	So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
c16360	Then God came to Balaam
c16361	and asked,
c16362	“Who are these men with you?”
c16363	And Balaam said to God,
c16364	“Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:
c16365	‘Behold, a people
c16366	has come out of Egypt,
c16367	and they cover the face of the land.
c16368	Now come
c16369	and put a curse on them for me.
c16370	Perhaps I may be able
c16371	to fight against them
c16372	and drive them away.’”
c16373	But God said to Balaam,
c16374	“Do not go with them.
c16375	You are not to curse this people,
c16376	for they are blessed.”
c16377	So Balaam got up the next morning
c16378	and said to Balak’s princes,
c16379	“Go back to your homeland,
c16380	because the LORD has refused
c16381	to let
c16382	me go with you.”
c16383	And the princes of Moab arose,
c16384	returned to Balak,
c16385	and said,
c16386	“Balaam refused
c16387	to come with us.”
c16388	Then Balak ... other
c16389	sent ... princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the [first messengers].
c16390	They came to Balaam
c16391	and said,
c16392	“This is what Balak son of Zippor says:
c16393	‘Please let nothing hinder
c16394	you from coming to me,
c16395	for I will honor you richly
c16396	whatever
c16397	you say.
c16398	and do
c16399	So please come
c16400	and put a curse on these people for me!’”
c16401	But Balaam replied
c16402	to the servants of Balak,
c16403	“If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold,
c16404	I could not
c16405	to go beyond the command of the LORD my God.
c16406	do anything small or great
c16407	So now, please stay here overnight as the others did,
c16408	that I may find out
c16409	what else the LORD
c16410	has to tell me.”
c16411	That night God came to Balaam
c16412	and said,
c16413	“Since
c16414	to summon you,
c16415	these men have come
c16416	get up
c16417	and go with them,
c16418	but you must only
c16419	what I tell you.”
c16420	do
c16421	So Balaam got up in the morning,
c16422	saddled his donkey,
c16423	and went with the princes of Moab.
c16424	Then God’s anger was kindled
c16425	because Balaam was going along,
c16426	and the Angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him.
c16427	Balaam was riding his donkey,
c16428	and his two servants were with him.
c16429	When the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD
c16430	standing in the road
c16431	with a drawn sword in His hand,
c16432	she turned off the path
c16433	and went into a field.
c16434	So Balaam beat her
c16435	to return her to the path.
c16436	Then the Angel of the LORD stood in a narrow passage between two vineyards,
c16437	with walls on either side.
c16439	And the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD
c16440	and pressed herself against the wall,
c16441	crushing Balaam’s foot against it.
c16442	once again.
c16443	So he beat her
c16444	And the Angel of the LORD ... on ahead
c16445	moved
c16446	and stood in a narrow place
c16447	where there was no room
c16448	to turn to the right or left.
c16449	When the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD,
c16450	she lay down under Balaam,
c16451	and [he] became furious
c16452	and beat [her] with his staff.
c16453	Then the LORD opened the donkey’s mouth,
c16454	and she said to Balaam,
c16455	“What have I done to you
c16456	that you have beaten me these three times?”
c16457	Balaam answered the donkey,
c16458	“You have made a fool of me!
c16459	If I had a sword in my hand,
c16460	I would kill you right now!”
c16461	But the donkey said to Balaam,
c16462	“Am I not the donkey
c16463	you have ridden all your life until today?
c16464	before?”
c16465	Have I ever treated you this way
c16466	he replied.
c16467	“No,”
c16468	Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes,
c16469	and he saw the Angel of the LORD
c16470	standing in the road
c16471	with a drawn sword in His hand.
c16473	And Balaam bowed low and fell facedown.
c16474	The Angel of the LORD asked him,
c16475	“Why have you beaten your donkey these three times?
c16476	Behold, I have come out to oppose you,
c16477	because your way is perverse before me.
c16478	The donkey saw
c16479	me and turned away from me these three times.
c16480	If she had not turned away,
c16481	I would surely have killed ... by now,
c16482	you ... and let her live.”
c16483	Balaam said to the Angel of the LORD,
c16484	“I have sinned,”
c16485	“for I did not realize
c16486	that you were standing
c16487	in the road to confront me.
c16488	And now,
c16489	if this is displeasing in Your sight,
c16490	I will go back [home].”
c16491	But the Angel of the LORD said to Balaam,
c16492	“Go with the men,
c16493	only
c16494	but you are to speak ... what
c16495	I tell you.”
c16496	So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
c16497	When Balak heard
c16498	that Balaam was coming,
c16499	he went out
c16500	to meet
c16501	him at the Moabite city
c16502	on the Arnon border,
c16503	at the edge of his territory.
c16504	And [he] said to Balaam, ... to me?
c16505	“Did I not send you an urgent summons?
c16507	Why did you not come
c16508	Am I really not able
c16509	to richly reward you?”
c16510	Balaam replied,
c16511	“See, I have come to you,”
c16513	“but can
c16514	I say just anything?
c16515	only the word
c16516	that God puts in my mouth.”
c16517	I must speak
c16518	So Balaam accompanied Balak,
c16519	and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
c16520	Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep,
c16521	and he gave [portions] to Balaam and the princes
c16522	who were with him.
c16523	The next morning,
c16524	Balak took Balaam
c16525	and brought him up to Bamoth-baal.
c16526	From there he could see the outskirts of the camp of the people.
c16527	Then Balaam said to Balak,
c16528	“Build me seven altars here,
c16529	and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.”
c16530	So Balak did
c16531	as Balaam had directed,
c16532	and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
c16533	Balaam said to Balak.
c16534	“Stay here by your burnt offering
c16535	while I am gone,”
c16536	“Perhaps the LORD
c16537	will meet with me.
c16539	And whatever He reveals to me,
c16540	I will tell you.”
c16541	So [Balaam] went off to a barren height,
c16542	and God met with him.
c16543	Balaam said,
c16544	“I have set up seven altars,”
c16545	“and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.”
c16546	Then the LORD put a message in Balaam’s mouth,
c16547	saying,
c16548	“Return to Balak
c16549	and give him this message.”
c16550	So he returned to Balak,
c16551	who was standing there beside his burnt offering, with all the princes of Moab.
c16552	And Balaam lifted up an oracle,
c16553	saying:
c16554	“Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the mountains of the east.
c16555	‘Come,’ he said,
c16556	‘put a curse on Jacob for me;
c16557	come,
c16558	denounce Israel!’
c16559	How ... cursed?
c16560	can I curse [what] God has not
c16561	How can I denounce [what]
c16562	the LORD has not denounced?
c16563	For I see them from atop the rocky cliffs,
c16564	and I watch them from the hills.
c16565	Behold, a people dwelling apart,
c16566	[who] will not reckon themselves among the nations.
c16567	Who can count the dust of Jacob or number [even] a fourth of Israel?
c16568	Let me die the death of the righteous;
c16569	let my end be like theirs!”
c16570	Balak said to Balaam.
c16571	“What have you done to me?”
c16572	you to curse my enemies,
c16573	“I brought
c16574	and behold, you have only blessed them!”
c16575	But [Balaam] replied,
c16577	“Should I not
c16578	exactly what the LORD puts in my mouth?”
c16580	speak
c16581	Then Balak said to him,
c16582	“Please come with me to another place
c16583	where you can see them.
c16584	You will only see the outskirts of their camp—
c16585	not all of them.
c16586	And from there, curse them for me.”
c16587	So Balak took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,
c16588	where he built seven altars
c16589	and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
c16590	Balaam said to Balak,
c16591	“Stay here beside your burnt offering
c16592	while I meet [the LORD] over there.”
c16593	And the LORD met with Balaam
c16594	and put a message in his mouth,
c16595	saying,
c16596	“Return to Balak
c16597	and speak what I tell you.”
c16598	So he returned to Balak,
c16599	who was standing there by his burnt offering
c16600	with the princes of Moab.
c16601	Balak asked.
c16602	“What did the LORD say?”
c16603	Then Balaam lifted up an oracle,
c16604	saying:
c16605	“Arise,
c16606	O Balak,
c16607	and listen;
c16608	give ear to me,
c16609	O son of Zippor.
c16610	God is not a man,
c16611	that He should lie,
c16612	or a son of man,
c16613	that He should change His mind.
c16614	Does He speak
c16615	and not act?
c16616	Does He promise
c16617	and not fulfill?
c16618	I have indeed ... a command to bless;
c16619	received
c16620	He has blessed,
c16621	and I cannot change it.
c16622	He considers no disaster for Jacob;
c16623	He sees no trouble for Israel.
c16624	The LORD their God is with them,
c16625	and the shout of the King is among them.
c16626	God brought them out of Egypt
c16627	with strength like a wild ox.
c16628	For there is no spell against Jacob
c16629	and no divination against Israel.
c16630	It will now be said of Jacob and Israel,
c16631	‘What great things God has done!’
c16632	Behold, the people rise like a lioness;
c16633	they rouse themselves like a lion,
c16634	not resting
c16635	until they devour their prey
c16636	and drink the blood of the slain.”
c16637	Then Balak said to Balaam,
c16638	“Neither curse them at all
c16639	nor bless them at all!”
c16640	But Balaam replied,
c16642	“Did I not tell you that
c16644	whatever
c16645	the LORD says,
c16646	I must do?”
c16647	said Balak,
c16648	“Please come,”
c16649	“I will take you to another place.
c16650	Perhaps it will please God
c16651	that you curse them for me from there.”
c16652	And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor,
c16653	which overlooks the wasteland.
c16654	Balaam said,
c16655	“Build me seven altars here,”
c16656	“and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.”
c16657	So Balak did
c16658	as Balaam had instructed,
c16659	and he offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
c16660	And when Balaam saw
c16661	that it pleased the LORD
c16662	to bless Israel,
c16663	he did not resort ... as on previous occasions,
c16664	to sorcery
c16665	but he turned his face toward the wilderness.
c16666	When Balaam looked up
c16667	and saw Israel
c16668	encamped tribe by tribe,
c16669	the Spirit of God came upon him,
c16670	and he lifted up an oracle,
c16671	saying:
c16672	“[This is] the prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,
c16673	the prophecy of a man whose eyes are open,
c16674	the prophecy
c16675	of one who hears the words of God,
c16676	who sees a vision from the Almighty, who bows down with eyes wide open:
c16677	How beautiful are your tents,
c16678	O Jacob,
c16679	your dwellings,
c16680	O Israel!
c16681	They spread out like palm groves, like gardens beside a stream,
c16682	like aloes the LORD has planted, like cedars beside the waters.
c16683	Water will flow from his buckets,
c16684	and his seed will have abundant water.
c16685	His king will be greater than Agag,
c16686	and his kingdom will be exalted.
c16687	God brought him out of Egypt
c16688	with strength like a wild ox,
c16689	to devour hostile nations
c16690	and crush their bones,
c16691	to pierce them with arrows.
c16692	He crouches,
c16693	he lies down like a lion; like a lioness,
c16694	who dares to rouse him?
c16695	those who bless you
c16696	Blessed are
c16698	those who curse you.
c16699	and cursed are
c16700	Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam,
c16701	and he struck his hands together
c16702	and said to Balaam,
c16703	to curse my enemies,
c16704	“I summoned you
c16705	but behold, you have persisted in blessing [them] these three times.
c16706	Therefore , flee at once to your home!
c16707	I said
c16708	I would richly reward you,
c16709	but instead the LORD has denied your reward.”
c16710	Balaam answered Balak,
c16711	“Did I not already ... the messengers
c16712	you sent me
c16713	tell
c16715	that even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold,
c16716	I could not
c16717	to go beyond the command of the LORD?
c16718	do anything of my own accord, good or bad,
c16719	I will speak whatever the LORD
c16720	says.
c16721	Now
c16722	I am going back to my people,
c16723	but come,
c16724	let me warn you
c16725	what this people will do to your people in the days to come.”
c16726	Then [Balaam] lifted up an oracle,
c16727	saying,
c16728	“[This is] the prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,
c16729	the prophecy of a man whose eyes are open,
c16730	the prophecy
c16731	of one who hears the words of God,
c16732	who has knowledge from the Most High,
c16733	who sees a vision from the Almighty, who bows down with eyes wide open:
c16734	I see him,
c16735	but not now;
c16736	I behold him,
c16737	but not near.
c16738	A star will come out of Jacob,
c16739	and a scepter will arise from Israel.
c16740	He will crush the skulls of Moab and strike down all the sons of Sheth.
c16741	Edom will become a possession,
c16742	Seir will be owned by his enemies,
c16743	but Israel will perform with valor.
c16744	A ruler will come from Jacob
c16745	and destroy the remnant of the city.”
c16746	Then Balaam saw Amalek
c16747	and lifted up an oracle,
c16748	saying:
c16749	“Amalek was first among the nations,
c16750	but his end [shall be] destruction.”
c16751	Next he saw the Kenites
c16752	and lifted up an oracle,
c16753	saying:
c16754	“Your dwelling place is secure,
c16755	and your nest is set in a cliff.
c16756	Yet ... will be
c16757	destroyed
c16758	Kain
c16759	when Asshur takes you captive.”
c16760	Once more [Balaam] lifted up an oracle,
c16761	saying:
c16762	“Ah,
c16763	who can live
c16764	unless God has ordained it?
c16765	Ships [will come] from the coast of Kittim;
c16766	they will subdue Asshur
c16767	and Eber,
c16768	but they too will perish forever.”
c16769	Then Balaam arose
c16770	went
c16771	and returned to his homeland,
c16772	and Balak also ... on his way.
c16773	While Israel was staying in Acacia Grove,
c16774	the men began
c16775	to indulge in sexual immorality with the daughters of Moab,
c16776	who also invited them to the sacrifices for their gods.
c16777	And the people ate
c16778	and bowed down to these gods.
c16779	So Israel joined in worshiping Baal of Peor,
c16780	and the LORD’s anger burned against [them].
c16781	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c16782	“Take all the leaders of the people
c16783	and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD,
c16784	so that His fierce anger may turn away from Israel.”
c16785	So Moses told the judges of Israel,
c16786	“Each of you must kill all of his men
c16787	who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.”
c16788	Just then, an Israelite man
c16789	brought to his family a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses [and] the whole congregation of Israel
c16790	while they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c16791	On seeing this, Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
c16792	got up from the assembly,
c16793	took a spear in his hand,
c16794	followed the Israelite into his tent,
c16795	and drove [the spear] through both of them— through the Israelite and on through the belly of the woman.
c16796	So the plague against the Israelites was halted,
c16798	but those who died in the plague
c16799	numbered 24,000.
c16800	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c16802	“Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned My wrath away from the Israelites;
c16803	for he was zealous [for My sake] among them,
c16804	so that I did not consume the Israelites in My zeal.
c16805	Declare, therefore,
c16806	that I grant him My covenant of peace.
c16807	It will be a covenant of permanent priesthood for him and his descendants,
c16808	because he was zealous for his God
c16809	and made atonement for the Israelites.”
c16810	The name of the Israelite
c16811	who was slain
c16812	with the Midianie woman
c16813	was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family.
c16814	And the name ... woman
c16815	of the slain
c16816	Midianite ... was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur,
c16817	a tribal chief of a Midianite family.
c16818	And the LORD said to Moses,
c16820	“Attack the Midianites
c16821	and strike them dead.
c16822	For they assailed you deceitfully
c16823	when they seduced you
c16824	in the matter of Peor and their sister Cozbi, the daughter of the Midianite leader,
c16825	[the woman] who was killed on the day the plague came because of Peor.”
c16826	After the plague [had ended],
c16827	the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron the priest,
c16829	“Take a census of the whole congregation of Israel, those twenty years of age and older, by the houses of their fathers— all
c16830	who can serve in the army of Israel.”
c16831	So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest issued
c16832	the instruction,
c16833	“[Take a census of the men] twenty years of age and older,
c16834	as the LORD has commanded Moses.” And [these were] the Israelites
c16835	who came out of the land of Egypt:
c16836	Reuben was the firstborn of Israel.
c16837	[These were] the descendants of Reuben: The Hanochite clan from Hanoch,
c16838	the Palluite clan from Pallu,
c16839	the Hezronite clan from Hezron,
c16840	[and] the Carmite clan from Carmi.
c16841	These ... clans of Reuben,
c16842	were the ... and their registration numbered 43,730.
c16843	Now the son of Pallu was Eliab,
c16844	and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram.
c16845	It was Dathan and Abiram, chosen by the congregation,
c16846	who fought against Moses and Aaron with the followers of Korah ... against
c16847	who rebelled ... the LORD.
c16848	And the earth opened its mouth
c16849	and swallowed them along with Korah, whose followers died
c16850	when the fire consumed 250 men.
c16851	They serve as a warning sign.
c16852	However, the line of Korah did not die out.
c16853	[These were] the descendants of Simeon by their clans:
c16854	The Nemuelite clan from Nemuel,
c16855	the Jaminite clan from Jamin,
c16856	the Jachinite clan from Jachin,
c16857	the Zerahite clan from Zerah,
c16858	[and] the Shaulite clan from Shaul.
c16859	These were the clans of Simeon, [and there were] 22,200 men.
c16860	[These were] the descendants of Gad by their clans:
c16861	The Zephonite clan from Zephon,
c16862	the Haggite clan from Haggi,
c16863	the Shunite clan from Shuni,
c16864	the Oznite clan from Ozni,
c16865	the Erite clan from Eri,
c16866	the Arodite clan from Arod,
c16867	[and] the Arelite clan from Areli.
c16868	These [were] the clans of Gad, and their registration numbered  40,500.
c16869	The sons of Judah [were] Er and Onan,
c16870	but they died in the land of Canaan.
c16871	These were the descendants of Judah by their clans:
c16872	The Shelanite clan from Shelah,
c16873	the Perezite clan from Perez,
c16874	the Zerahite clan from Zerah.
c16875	And [these were] the descendants of Perez:
c16876	the Hezronite clan from Hezron
c16877	[and] the Hamulite clan from Hamul.
c16878	These [were] the clans of Judah, and their registration numbered  76,500.
c16879	[These were] the descendants of Issachar by their clans:
c16880	The Tolaite clan from Tola,
c16881	the Punite clan from Puvah,
c16882	the Jashubite clan from Jashub,
c16883	[and] the Shimronite clan from Shimron.
c16884	These [were] the clans of Issachar, and their registration numbered  64,300.
c16885	[These were] the descendants of Zebulun by their clans:
c16886	The Seredite clan from Sered,
c16887	the Elonite clan from Elon,
c16888	[and] the Jahleelite clan from Jahleel.
c16889	These [were] the clans of Zebulun, and their registration numbered  60,500.
c16890	The descendants of Joseph [were] their clans of Manasseh and Ephraim.
c16891	[These were] the descendants of Manasseh:
c16892	The Machirite clan from Machir.
c16893	Machir was the father of Gilead,
c16894	the Gileadite clan from Gilead.
c16895	These [were] the descendants of Gilead:
c16896	the Iezerite clan from Iezer,
c16897	the Helekite clan from Helek,
c16898	the Asrielite clan from Asriel,
c16899	the Shechemite clan from Shechem,
c16900	the Shemidaite clan from Shemida,
c16901	[and] the Hepherite clan from Hepher.
c16902	Now Zelophehad son of Hepher
c16903	had no sons—
c16904	only daughters.
c16905	The names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
c16906	These [were] the clans of Manasseh,
c16907	and their registration numbered  52,700.
c16908	These [were] the descendants of Ephraim by their clans:
c16909	The Shuthelahite clan from Shuthelah,
c16910	the Becherite clan from Becher,
c16911	[and] the Tahanite clan from Tahan.
c16912	And the descendants of Shuthelah [were]
c16913	the Eranite clan from Eran.
c16914	These [were] the clans of Ephraim, and their registration numbered  32,500.
c16915	These clans [were] the descendants of Joseph.
c16916	[These were] the descendants of Benjamin by their clans:
c16917	The Belaite clan from Bela,
c16918	the Ashbelite clan from Ashbel,
c16919	the Ahiramite clan from Ahiram,
c16920	the Shuphamite clan from Shupham,
c16921	[and] the Huphamite clan from Hupham.
c16922	And the descendants of Bela from Ard and Naaman [were] the Ardite clan from Ard
c16923	[and] the Naamite clan from Naaman.
c16924	These [were] the clans of Benjamin,
c16925	and their registration numbered  45,600.
c16926	These [were] the descendants of Dan by their clans:
c16927	The Shuhamite clan from Shuham.
c16928	These were the clans of Dan.
c16929	All [of them] [were] Shuhamite clans, and their registration numbered  64,400.
c16930	[These were] the descendants of Asher by their clans:
c16931	The Imnite clan from Imnah,
c16932	the Ishvite clan from Ishvi,
c16933	the Beriite clan from Beriah.
c16934	[These were] the descendants of Beriah:
c16935	the Heberite clan from Heber,
c16936	[and] the Malchielite clan from Malchiel.
c16937	And the name of Asher’s daughter was Serah.
c16938	These [were] the clans of Asher, and their registration numbered  53,400.
c16939	[These were] the descendants of Naphtali by their clans:
c16940	The Jahzeelite clan from Jahzeel,
c16941	the Gunite clan from Guni,
c16942	the Jezerite clan from Jezer,
c16943	[and] the Shillemite clan from Shillem.
c16944	These [were] the clans of Naphtali,
c16945	and their registration numbered  45,400.
c16946	These men of Israel numbered 601,730[in all].
c16947	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c16949	“The land is to be divided among [the tribes] as an inheritance, according to the number of names.
c16950	Increase the inheritance for a large [tribe]
c16951	and decrease it for a small one;
c16952	each is to receive its inheritance according to the number of those registered.
c16953	Indeed, the land must be divided by lot;
c16954	they shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
c16955	Each inheritance is to be divided by lot among the larger and smaller tribes.”
c16956	Now these were the Levites registered by their clans:
c16957	The Gershonite clan from Gershon,
c16958	the Kohathite clan from Kohath,
c16959	and the Merarite clan from Merari.
c16960	These [were] the families of the Levites: The Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, and the Korahite clan.
c16961	Now Kohath was the father of Amram,
c16962	and Amram’s wife was named Jochebed. She was also a descendant of Levi,
c16963	born to Levi in Egypt.
c16964	To Amram she bore Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam.
c16965	Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar were born to Aaron,
c16966	but Nadab and Abihu died
c16967	when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD.
c16968	The registration [of the Levites] totaled 23,000, every male one month old or more;
c16969	they were not registered among the other Israelites, because
c16970	no inheritance was given to them among the Israelites.
c16971	These were the ones registered by Moses and Eleazar the priest
c16972	when they numbered the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho.
c16973	Among all these, however, there was not one who had been registered by Moses and Aaron the priest
c16974	when they numbered the Israelites in the Wilderness of Sinai.
c16975	For the LORD had told them
c16976	that they would surely die in the wilderness.
c16977	Not one was left
c16978	except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
c16979	Now the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. ... They approached
c16980	These were the names of his daughters:
c16981	Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
c16982	the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the entire congregation,
c16983	and said,
c16984	“Our father died in the wilderness,
c16985	but he was not among the followers
c16986	of Korah who gathered together against the LORD.
c16987	Instead, he died because of his own sin,
c16988	and he had no sons.
c16989	Why should the name of our father disappear from his clan
c16990	because he had no sons?
c16991	Give us property among our father’s brothers.”
c16992	So Moses brought their case before the LORD,
c16993	and the LORD answered him,
c16995	“The daughters of Zelophehad speak correctly.
c16996	You certainly must give them property as an inheritance among their father’s brothers
c16997	and transfer their father’s inheritance to them.
c16998	Furthermore, you shall say to the Israelites,
c17000	a man
c17001	‘If ... dies
c17002	and leaves no son,
c17003	you are to transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
c17004	If he has no daughter,
c17005	give his inheritance to his brothers.
c17006	If he has no brothers,
c17007	give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.
c17008	And if his father has no brothers,
c17009	give his inheritance ... of kin
c17010	to the next ... from his clan,
c17011	that he may take possession of it.
c17012	This is to be a statutory ordinance for the Israelites,
c17013	as the LORD has commanded Moses.’”
c17014	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c17015	“Go up this mountain of the Abarim range
c17016	and see the land
c17017	that I have given the Israelites.
c17018	After you have seen it,
c17019	you too will be gathered to your people,
c17020	as your brother Aaron was;
c17021	for when the congregation contended in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you rebelled against My command
c17022	to show My holiness in their sight regarding the waters.”
c17023	Those were the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin.
c17024	So Moses appealed to the LORD,
c17026	“May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation
c17027	who will go out
c17028	and come in before them, and who
c17029	will lead them out
c17030	and bring them in,
c17031	so that the congregation of the LORD will not be like sheep
c17032	without a shepherd.”
c17033	And the LORD replied to Moses,
c17034	“Take Joshua son of Nun, a man with
c17035	the Spirit in him,
c17036	and lay your hands on him.
c17037	Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation,
c17038	and commission him in their sight.
c17039	Confer on him [some of] your authority,
c17040	so that the whole congregation of Israel will obey him.
c17041	He shall stand before Eleazar the priest,
c17042	who will seek counsel for him before the LORD by the judgment of the Urim.
c17043	At his command ... will go out
c17044	he and all the Israelites with him, the entire congregation, ... and come in.”
c17045	Moses did
c17046	as the LORD had commanded him.
c17047	He took Joshua,
c17048	had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation,
c17049	and laid his hands on him
c17050	and commissioned him,
c17051	as the LORD had instructed through Moses.
c17052	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c17054	“Command the Israelites
c17055	and say to them:
c17056	See ... the food for My offerings by fire, as a pleasing aroma to Me.
c17057	that you present to Me at its appointed time
c17058	And tell them:
c17059	This [is] the offering by fire
c17060	you are to present to the LORD:
c17061	two unblemished year-old male lambs, as a regular burnt offering each day.
c17062	You are to offer one lamb in the morning
c17063	and the other at twilight,
c17064	along with a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering,
c17065	mixed with a quarter hin of olive oil from pressed olives.
c17066	This is a regular burnt offering
c17067	established at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c17068	And the drink offering accompanying each lamb [shall be] a quarter hin.
c17069	Pour out the offering of fermented drink to the LORD in the sanctuary area.
c17070	You are to offer the second lamb at twilight,
c17071	with the same kind of grain offering and drink offering as in the morning.
c17072	It is an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
c17073	On the Sabbath day, present two unblemished year-old male lambs, accompanied by a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour
c17074	mixed with oil,
c17075	as well as a drink offering.
c17076	This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
c17077	At the beginning of every month, you are to present to the LORD a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all unblemished,
c17078	along with three-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour ... as a grain offering
c17079	mixed with oil
c17080	for each bull,
c17081	two-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour ... as a grain offering
c17082	mixed with oil
c17083	for the ram,
c17084	and a tenth [of an ephah] of fine flour ... as a grain offering
c17085	mixed with oil
c17086	for each lamb.
c17087	This is a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma,
c17088	an offering made by fire to the LORD.
c17089	Their drink offerings
c17090	shall be half a hin ... with each bull,
c17091	a third of a hin with the ram,
c17092	of wine ... and a quarter hin with each lamb.
c17093	This is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon throughout the year.
c17094	In addition to the regular burnt offering ... one male goat is to be presented to the LORD as a sin offering.
c17095	with its drink offering,
c17096	The fourteenth day of the first month is the LORD’s Passover.
c17097	On the fifteenth day of this month, there shall be a feast;
c17098	for seven days unleavened bread is to be eaten.
c17099	On the first day there is to be a sacred assembly;
c17100	you are not to do any regular work.

c17191	You are to present these [offerings] to the LORD at your appointed times, in addition to your vow and freewill offerings, whether burnt offerings, grain offerings, drink offerings, or peace offerings.”
c17192	So Moses spoke all this to the Israelites
c17193	just as the LORD had commanded him.
c17194	Then Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel,
c17196	“This
c17197	is what the LORD has commanded:
c17198	a man
c17199	If ... makes a vow to the LORD
c17200	or swears an oath
c17201	to obligate himself by a pledge,
c17202	he must not break his word;
c17203	everything
c17204	he has promised.
c17205	he must do
c17206	a woman
c17207	And if ... makes a vow to the LORD
c17208	in her father’s house during her youth ... or obligates herself by a pledge,
c17209	and her father hears about her vow or pledge
c17211	[but] says nothing to her,
c17212	all the vows ... shall stand.
c17213	[and] pledges
c17214	with which she has bound herself
c17216	But if her father prohibits her on the day
c17217	he hears
c17218	about it, ... of the vows or pledges
c17219	with which she has bound herself
c17220	none ... are binding.
c17221	The LORD will absolve her
c17222	because her father has prohibited her.
c17223	If a woman marries
c17224	while under a vow
c17225	or rash promise
c17226	by which she has bound herself,
c17227	and her husband hears of it ... on that day,
c17229	but says nothing to her
c17230	then the vows
c17231	and pledges
c17232	by which she has bound herself
c17233	shall stand.
c17234	But if ... when
c17235	her husband ... he hears of it,
c17236	prohibits her
c17237	he nullifies the vow
c17238	that binds her
c17239	or the rash promise
c17240	she has made,
c17241	and the LORD will absolve her.
c17242	vow a widow or divorced woman
c17243	Every
c17244	pledges to fulfill
c17245	is binding on her.
c17246	If a woman in her husband’s house has made a vow
c17247	or put herself under an obligation with an oath,
c17248	and her husband hears of it
c17249	says nothing to her
c17250	and does not prohibit her,
c17251	then all the vows
c17252	[and] obligations
c17253	with which she has bound herself
c17254	shall stand.
c17255	But if her husband nullifies them on the day ... has nullified them,
c17256	he hears of them,
c17257	then nothing that came from her lips, whether her vows or her obligation, shall stand.
c17258	Her husband
c17259	and the LORD will absolve her.
c17260	any vow or any sworn pledge
c17261	to deny herself.
c17262	Her husband may confirm
c17263	or nullify
c17264	But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day,
c17265	then he confirms all the vows and pledges
c17266	that bind her.
c17267	He has confirmed them,
c17268	because he said nothing to her on the day
c17269	he heard about them.
c17270	But if he nullifies them
c17271	after he hears of them,
c17272	then he will bear her iniquity.”
c17273	These are the statutes
c17274	that the LORD commanded Moses
c17275	concerning relationships between a man and his wife, and between a father and a young daughter still in his home.
c17276	And the LORD said to Moses,
c17278	“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites.
c17279	After that, you will be gathered to your people.”
c17280	So Moses told the people,
c17282	“Arm some of your men for war,
c17283	that they may go against the Midianites
c17284	and execute the LORD’s vengeance on them.
c17285	Send into battle a thousand men from each tribe of Israel.”
c17286	So a thousand men were recruited from each tribe of Israel— twelve thousand armed for war.
c17287	And Moses sent the thousand from each tribe into battle,
c17288	along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest,
c17289	who took with him the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.
c17290	Then they waged war against Midian,
c17291	as the LORD had commanded Moses,
c17292	and killed every male.
c17293	Along with those who were slain, they killed the kings of Midian— Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba— the five kings of Midian.
c17294	They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
c17295	The Israelites captured the Midianite women and their children,
c17296	and they plundered all their herds, flocks, and goods.
c17297	Then they burned all the cities where [the Midianites] had lived, as well as all their encampments,
c17298	and carried away all the plunder and spoils, both people and animals.
c17299	They brought the captives, spoils, and plunder to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab,
c17300	by the Jordan across from Jericho.
c17301	And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation went to meet them
c17303	outside the camp.
c17304	But Moses was angry with the officers of the army— the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—
c17305	who were returning from the battle.
c17306	he asked them.
c17307	“Have you spared all the women?”
c17308	“Look, these women {caused} the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, ... struck
c17309	to turn unfaithfully against the LORD at Peor,
c17310	so that the plague ... the congregation of the LORD.
c17311	So now, kill all the boys,
c17312	every woman
c17313	who has had relations with a man,
c17314	and kill
c17315	every girl
c17316	who has never had relations with a man.
c17317	but spare for yourselves
c17318	are to remain outside the camp for seven days.
c17319	All of you
c17320	who have killed a person
c17322	or touched the dead
c17323	On the third day and the seventh day you are to purify [both] yourselves and your captives.
c17324	And purify every garment and leather good, everything made of goat’s hair, and every article of wood.”
c17325	Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers
c17326	who had gone into battle,
c17327	“This is the statute of the law
c17328	which the LORD has commanded Moses:
c17329	Only the gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead—
c17330	everything
c17331	that can withstand the fire—
c17332	must be put through the fire,
c17333	and it will be clean.
c17334	But it must still be purified with the water of purification.
c17335	And everything
c17336	that cannot withstand the fire
c17337	must pass through the water.
c17338	On the seventh day you are to wash your clothes,
c17339	and you will be clean.
c17340	After that you may enter the camp.”
c17341	The LORD said to Moses,
c17343	“You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the congregation are to take a count of what was captured, [both] of man and beast.
c17344	Then divide the captives between the troops
c17345	who went out to battle
c17346	and the rest of the congregation.
c17347	Set aside a tribute for the LORD from what belongs to the soldiers
c17348	who went into battle:
c17349	one out of every five hundred, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, or sheep.
c17350	Take it from their half
c17351	and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD.
c17352	From the Israelites’ half, take one out of every fifty, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, [or] other animals,
c17353	and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.”
c17354	So Moses and Eleazar the priest did
c17355	as the LORD had commanded Moses,
c17356	[and] this plunder remained from the spoils
c17357	the soldiers had taken:
c17358	675,000 sheep,
c17359	72,000 cattle,
c17360	61,000 donkeys,
c17361	women
c17362	who had not slept with a man.
c17363	and 32,000
c17364	This [was] the half portion
c17365	for those who had gone to war:
c17366	337,500 sheep
c17367	with a tribute to the LORD of 675,
c17368	36,000 cattle
c17369	with a tribute to the LORD of 72,
c17370	 30,500 donkeys
c17371	with a tribute to the LORD of 61,
c17372	and 16,000 people
c17373	with a tribute to the LORD of 32.
c17374	Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as an offering for the LORD,
c17375	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c17376	From the Israelites’ half,
c17377	which Moses had set apart from the men
c17378	who had gone to war,
c17379	this half belonged to the congregation :337,500 sheep,
c17380	36,000 cattle,
c17381	30,500 donkeys,
c17382	and 16,000 people.
c17383	From the Israelites’ half, Moses took one out of every fifty persons and animals
c17384	and gave them to the Levites who kept charge of the tabernacle of the LORD,
c17385	as the LORD had commanded him.
c17386	Then the officers ... approached Moses
c17387	who were over the units of the army—
c17388	the commanders of thousands and of hundreds—
c17389	and said,
c17390	“Your servants have counted the soldiers
c17391	under our command,
c17392	and not one of us is missing.
c17393	So we have brought to the LORD an offering
c17394	each man
c17395	acquired—
c17396	of the gold articles ... armlets, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces—
c17397	to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.”
c17398	So Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them all the articles made of gold.
c17399	All the gold ... as an offering
c17400	presented ... to the LORD
c17401	that the commanders of thousands and of hundreds ... weighed 16,750 shekels.
c17402	Each ... had taken plunder for himself.
c17403	of the soldiers
c17404	And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds
c17405	and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
c17406	Now the Reubenites and Gadites, who had ... herds and flocks,
c17407	very large
c17408	surveyed the lands of Jazer and Gilead,
c17409	and they saw that the region was suitable for livestock.
c17410	So the Gadites and Reubenites came
c17411	to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the congregation, and said,
c17413	“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,
c17414	are suitable
c17415	which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel,
c17416	for livestock—
c17417	and your servants have livestock.”
c17418	they said,
c17419	“If we have found favor in your sight,”
c17420	“let this land be given to your servants as a possession.
c17421	Do not make us cross the Jordan.”
c17422	But Moses asked the Gadites and Reubenites,
c17423	“Shall your brothers go to war
c17424	while you sit here?
c17425	Why are you discouraging the Israelites
c17426	from crossing into the land
c17427	the LORD has given them?
c17428	This is what your fathers did
c17429	when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea
c17430	to look over the land.
c17431	For when [your fathers] went up to the valley of Eshcol
c17432	and saw the land,
c17433	they discouraged the Israelites
c17434	from entering the land
c17435	the LORD had given them.
c17436	So the LORD’s anger was kindled that day,
c17437	and He swore an oath,
c17438	saying,
c17439	not one of the men ... will see
c17440	who came out of Egypt
c17441	twenty years of age or older ... the land
c17442	I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—
c17443	‘Because they did not follow Me wholeheartedly,
c17444	not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun—
c17445	because they did follow the LORD wholeheartedly.’
c17446	The LORD’s anger burned against Israel,
c17447	and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years,
c17448	until the whole generation ... was gone.
c17449	who had done
c17450	evil in [His] sight
c17451	Now behold, you, a brood of sinners, have risen up in place of your fathers
c17452	to further stoke the burning anger of the LORD against Israel.
c17453	For if you turn away from following Him,
c17454	He will once again
c17455	leave ... in the wilderness,
c17456	this people ... and you will be the cause of their destruction.”
c17457	Then [the Gadites and Reubenites] approached [Moses]
c17458	and said,
c17459	“We want to build sheepfolds here for our livestock
c17460	and cities for our little ones.
c17461	But we will arm ourselves
c17462	and be ready to go ahead of the Israelites
c17463	until we have brought them into their place.
c17464	Meanwhile, our little ones will remain in the fortified cities for protection from the inhabitants of the land.
c17465	We will not return to our homes
c17466	until every Israelite has taken possession of his inheritance.
c17467	Yet we will not have an inheritance with them across the Jordan and beyond,
c17468	because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.”
c17469	Moses replied,
c17470	“If you do this,”
c17471	“if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle,
c17472	and if every one of your armed men crosses the Jordan before the LORD,
c17473	until He has driven His enemies out before Him,
c17474	then when the land is subdued before the LORD,
c17475	you may return
c17476	and be free of obligation to the LORD and to Israel.
c17477	And this land will belong to you as a possession before the LORD.
c17478	But if you do not do this,
c17479	you will certainly sin against the LORD;
c17480	and you may be assured that your sin
c17481	will find you out.
c17482	Build cities for your little ones
c17483	and folds for your flocks,
c17485	what you have promised.”
c17486	but do
c17487	The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses,
c17489	“Your servants will do
c17490	just as our lord commands.
c17491	Our children, our wives, our livestock, and all our animals will remain here in the cities of Gilead.
c17492	But your servants are equipped for war, and every man will cross over to the battle before the LORD,
c17493	just as our lord says.”
c17494	So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the family leaders of the tribes of Israel.
c17495	And Moses said to them,
c17496	“If the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, with every man armed for battle before the LORD,
c17497	and the land is subdued before you,
c17498	you are to give them the land of Gilead as a possession.
c17499	But if they do not go across with you armed,
c17500	their possession must be among you in the land of Canaan.”
c17501	The Gadites and Reubenites replied,
c17503	“As the LORD has spoken to your servants,
c17504	so we will do.
c17505	We will cross over into the land of Canaan armed before the LORD,
c17506	that we may have our inheritance on this side of the Jordan.”
c17507	So Moses gave to the Gadites, to the Reubenites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan— the land including its cities and the territory surrounding them.
c17508	And the Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
c17509	Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
c17510	Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and they built folds for their flocks.
c17511	The Reubenites built up Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
c17512	as well as Nebo and Baal-meon
c17513	(whose names were changed),
c17514	and Sibmah.
c17515	And they renamed the cities
c17516	they rebuilt.
c17517	The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead,
c17518	captured it,
c17519	and drove out the Amorites
c17520	who were there.
c17521	So Moses gave Gilead to the clan of Machir son of Manasseh,
c17522	and they settled there.
c17523	Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, went
c17524	and captured their villages
c17525	and called them Havvoth-jair.
c17526	And Nobah went
c17527	and captured Kenath and its villages
c17528	and called it Nobah, after his own name.
c17529	These [are] the journeys of the Israelites
c17530	as they came out of the land of Egypt by divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
c17531	At the LORD’s command, Moses recorded the stages of their journey.
c17532	These are the stages listed by their starting points:
c17533	On the fifteenth day of the first month, on ... [the Israelites] set out from Rameses.
c17534	the day after the Passover, ... [They] marched out triumphantly in full view of all the Egyptians,
c17535	[who] were burying
c17536	whom the LORD had struck down among them;
c17537	all [their] firstborn,
c17538	for the LORD had executed judgment against their gods.
c17539	The Israelites set out from Rameses
c17540	and camped at Succoth.
c17541	They set out from Succoth
c17542	and camped at Etham,
c17543	on the edge of the wilderness.
c17544	They set out from Etham
c17545	and turned back to Pi-hahiroth,
c17546	opposite Baal-zephon,
c17547	and they camped near Migdol.
c17548	They set out from Pi-hahiroth
c17549	and crossed through the sea, into the wilderness,
c17550	and they journeyed three days into the Wilderness of Etham
c17551	and camped at Marah.
c17552	They set out from Marah
c17553	and came to Elim,
c17554	where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees,
c17555	and they camped there.
c17556	They set out from Elim
c17557	and camped by the Red Sea.
c17558	They set out from the Red Sea
c17559	and camped in the Wilderness of Sin.
c17560	They set out from the Wilderness of Sin
c17561	and camped in Dophkah.
c17562	They set out from Dophkah
c17563	and camped at Alush.
c17564	They set out from Alush
c17565	and camped at Rephidim,
c17566	where there was no water for the people
c17567	to drink.
c17568	They set out from Rephidim
c17569	and camped in the Wilderness of Sinai.
c17570	They set out from the Wilderness of Sinai
c17571	and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
c17572	They set out from Kibroth-hattaavah
c17573	and camped at Hazeroth.
c17574	They set out from Hazeroth
c17575	and camped at Rithmah.
c17576	They set out from Rithmah
c17577	and camped at Rimmon-perez.
c17578	They set out from Rimmon-perez
c17579	and camped at Libnah.
c17580	They set out from Libnah
c17581	and camped at Rissah.
c17582	They set out from Rissah
c17583	and camped at Kehelathah.
c17584	They set out from Kehelathah
c17585	and camped at Mount Shepher.
c17586	They set out from Mount Shepher
c17587	and camped at Haradah.
c17588	They set out from Haradah
c17589	and camped at Makheloth.
c17590	They set out from Makheloth
c17591	and camped at Tahath.
c17592	They set out from Tahath
c17593	and camped at Terah.
c17594	They set out from Terah
c17595	and camped at Mithkah.
c17596	They set out from Mithkah
c17597	and camped at Hashmonah.
c17598	They set out from Hashmonah
c17599	and camped at Moseroth.
c17600	They set out from Moseroth
c17601	and camped at Bene-jaakan.
c17602	They set out from Bene-jaakan
c17603	and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
c17604	They set out from Hor-haggidgad
c17605	and camped at Jotbathah.
c17606	They set out from Jotbathah
c17607	and camped at Abronah.
c17608	They set out from Abronah
c17609	and camped at Ezion-geber.
c17610	They set out from Ezion-geber
c17611	and camped ... in the Wilderness of Zin.
c17612	at Kadesh
c17613	They set out from Kadesh
c17614	and camped at Mount Hor, on the outskirts of the land of Edom.
c17615	At the LORD’s command, Aaron the priest climbed Mount Hor
c17616	and died there ... in the fortieth year
c17617	after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt.
c17618	on the first [day] of the fifth month,
c17619	Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.
c17620	Now the Canaanite king of Arad, ... heard
c17621	who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan,
c17622	that the Israelites were coming.
c17623	And they set out from Mount Hor
c17624	and camped at Zalmonah.
c17625	They set out from Zalmonah
c17626	and camped at Punon.
c17627	They set out from Punon
c17628	and camped at Oboth.
c17629	They set out from Oboth
c17630	and camped at Iye-abarim on the border of Moab.
c17631	They set out from Iyim
c17632	and camped at Dibon-gad.
c17633	They set out from Dibon-gad
c17634	and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
c17635	They set out from Almon-diblathaim
c17636	and camped in the mountains of Abarim facing Nebo.
c17637	They set out from the mountains of Abarim
c17638	and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
c17639	And there on the plains of Moab they camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth to the plains of Moab.
c17640	On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses,
c17642	“Speak to the Israelites ... into
c17643	and tell them:
c17644	When you cross the Jordan ... the land of Canaan,
c17645	you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you,
c17646	destroy all their carved images
c17647	and cast idols, ... all
c17648	and demolish ... their high places.
c17649	You are to take possession of the land
c17650	and settle in it,
c17651	for I have given you the land
c17652	to possess.
c17653	And you are to divide the land by lot according to your clans.
c17654	Give a larger inheritance to a larger clan
c17655	and a smaller inheritance to a smaller one.
c17656	Whatever falls to each one by lot
c17657	will be his.
c17658	You will receive an inheritance according to the tribes of your fathers.
c17659	But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you,
c17660	will become
c17661	those you allow to remain
c17662	thorns in your eyes
c17663	and in your sides;
c17664	they will harass you in the land
c17665	where you settle.
c17666	And then
c17667	what I had planned
c17668	to do to them.”
c17669	I will do to you
c17670	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c17672	“Command the Israelites
c17673	and say to them:
c17674	When you enter the land of Canaan,
c17675	it
c17676	will be allotted to you as an inheritance
c17677	with these boundaries:
c17678	Your southern border will extend from the wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom.
c17679	On the east, your southern border will extend from the end of the Salt Sea,
c17680	turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim,
c17681	continue to Zin,
c17682	and go south of Kadesh-barnea.
c17683	Then it will go on to Hazar-addar
c17684	and proceed to Azmon,
c17685	where [it] will turn from Azmon, join the Brook of Egypt,
c17686	and end at the Sea.
c17687	Your western border
c17688	will be ... of the Great Sea;
c17689	the coastline
c17690	this will be your boundary on the west.
c17691	Your northern border will run
c17692	from the Great Sea directly to Mount Hor,
c17693	and from Mount Hor
c17694	to Lebo-hamath,
c17695	[then] extending to Zedad,
c17696	continuing to Ziphron,
c17697	and ending at Hazar-enan.
c17698	This will be your boundary on the north.
c17699	And your eastern border will run straight from Hazar-enan to Shepham,
c17700	[then] go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain
c17701	and continue along
c17702	the slopes east of the Sea of Chinnereth.
c17703	Then the border will go down along the Jordan
c17704	and end at the Salt Sea.
c17705	This will be your land, defined by its borders on all sides.”
c17706	So Moses commanded the Israelites,
c17708	“{Apportion} this land
c17709	by lot as an inheritance, which
c17710	the LORD commanded
c17711	to be given to the nine and a half tribes.
c17712	For the tribes of the Reubenites [and] Gadites, ... have already received their inheritance.
c17713	along with the half-tribe of Manasseh,
c17714	These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan from Jericho, toward the sunrise.”
c17715	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c17717	“These are the names of the men
c17718	who are to assign the land as an inheritance for you:
c17719	Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.
c17720	Appoint one leader from each tribe
c17721	to distribute the land.
c17722	These are their names:
c17723	Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah;
c17724	Shemuel son of Ammihud from the tribe of Simeon;
c17725	Elidad son of Chislon from the tribe of Benjamin;
c17726	Bukki son of Jogli, a leader from the tribe of Dan;
c17727	son of Joseph;
c17728	Hanniel son of Ephod, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh
c17729	Kemuel son of Shiphtan, a leader from the tribe of Ephraim [son of Joseph];
c17730	Eli-zaphan son of Parnach, a leader from the tribe of Zebulun;
c17731	Paltiel son of Azzan, a leader from the tribe of Issachar;
c17732	Ahihud son of Shelomi, a leader from the tribe of Asher;
c17733	and Pedahel son of Ammihud, a leader from the tribe of Naphtali.”
c17734	These
c17735	are the ones whom the LORD commanded
c17736	to apportion the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
c17737	Again the LORD spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho:
c17739	“Command the Israelites
c17740	to give, from the inheritance they will possess, cities for the Levites
c17741	to live in
c17742	and pasturelands around the cities.
c17743	The cities will be
c17744	for them to live in,
c17745	and the pasturelands will be for their herds, flocks, and all their other livestock.
c17746	The pasturelands around the cities
c17747	you are to give the Levites
c17748	[will extend] a thousand cubits from the wall on every side.
c17749	You are also to measure two thousand cubits outside the city on the east,
c17750	two thousand cubits on the south,
c17751	two thousand cubits and on the west,
c17752	[and] two thousand cubits on the north,
c17753	with the city in the center.
c17754	These areas will serve as larger pasturelands for the cities.
c17755	of the cities
c17756	you give the Levites
c17757	Six ... as cities of refuge,
c17758	are to be appointed
c17759	to which a manslayer may flee.
c17760	In addition to these, give [the Levites] forty-two other cities.
c17761	The total number of cities
c17762	you give the Levites
c17763	[will be] forty-eight,
c17764	with their corresponding pasturelands.
c17765	The cities
c17766	that you apportion from the territory of the Israelites
c17767	more from a larger [tribe]
c17768	and less from a smaller one.
c17769	in proportion to the inheritance of each [tribe]:
c17771	should be given to the Levites
c17772	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c17774	“Speak to the Israelites
c17775	and tell them:
c17776	When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
c17777	designate cities
c17778	to serve as your cities of refuge,
c17779	so that a person ... may flee there.
c17780	who kills someone unintentionally
c17781	You are to have these cities as a refuge from the avenger,
c17782	so that the manslayer will not die
c17783	until he stands trial before the assembly.
c17784	The cities
c17785	you select
c17786	will be your six cities of refuge.
c17787	Select three cities across the Jordan
c17788	and three in the land of Canaan
c17789	as cities of refuge.
c17790	These six cities will serve as a refuge for the Israelites and for the foreigner or sojourner among them,
c17791	so that anyone ... may flee there.
c17792	who kills a person unintentionally
c17793	If, however, anyone strikes a person with an iron object
c17794	and kills him,
c17795	he is a murderer;
c17796	the murderer must surely be put to death.
c17797	Or if anyone has in his hand a stone
c17798	of deadly size,
c17799	and he strikes
c17800	and kills another,
c17801	he is a murderer;
c17802	the murderer must surely be put to death.
c17803	If anyone has in his hand ... object of wood,
c17804	a deadly
c17805	and he strikes
c17806	and kills another,
c17807	he is a murderer;
c17808	the murderer must surely be put to death.
c17809	The avenger of blood
c17810	{is to put} the murderer to death;
c17811	when he finds him,
c17812	he is to kill him.
c17813	Likewise, if anyone maliciously pushes another
c17814	or intentionally throws an object at him
c17815	and kills him,
c17816	or if in hostility he strikes him with his hand
c17817	and he dies,
c17818	the one who struck him must surely be put to death;
c17819	he is a murderer.
c17820	When the avenger of blood ... the murderer, he is to kill him.
c17821	finds
c17822	But if anyone pushes a person suddenly, without hostility,
c17823	or unintentionally hits him with an object,
c17824	or ... a heavy stone
c17826	without looking
c17827	drops
c17828	that kills him,
c17829	but he was not an enemy
c17830	and did not intend to harm him,
c17831	then the congregation must judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.
c17832	The assembly is to protect the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood.
c17833	Then the assembly will return him to the city of refuge
c17834	to which he fled, ... who
c17835	and he must live there until the death of the high priest,
c17836	was anointed with the holy oil.
c17837	But if the manslayer ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge
c17838	to which he fled
c17839	and the avenger of blood finds him outside of his city of refuge
c17840	and kills him, the avenger ... be guilty of bloodshed,
c17841	will not
c17842	because [the manslayer] must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest.
c17843	Only after the death of the high priest may [he] return to the land he owns.
c17844	This will be a statutory ordinance for you for the generations to come, wherever you live.
c17845	If anyone kills a person,
c17846	the murderer is to be put to death on the testimony of [multiple] witnesses.
c17847	But no one ... based on the testimony of a lone witness.
c17848	is to be put to death
c17849	You are not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer
c17850	who deserves
c17851	to die;
c17852	he must surely be put to death.
c17853	Nor should you accept a ransom
c17854	for the person who flees to a city of refuge
c17855	and allow him to return
c17856	and live on his own land before the death of the high priest.
c17857	Do not pollute the land
c17858	where you live,
c17859	for bloodshed
c17860	pollutes the land,
c17861	and no atonement can be made for the land on which the blood
c17862	is shed,
c17863	except by the blood of the one who shed it.
c17864	Do not defile the land
c17865	where you live
c17866	and where I dwell. ... among
c17867	For I, the LORD, dwell ... the Israelites.”
c17868	Now the family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh, one of the clans of Joseph, approached
c17869	and addressed Moses and the leaders who were the heads of the Israelite families,
c17870	saying,
c17871	“When the LORD commanded my lord
c17872	to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot,
c17873	[He] also commanded [him]
c17874	to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
c17875	But if they marry any of the men from the [other] tribes of Israel,
c17876	their inheritance will be withdrawn from the portion of our fathers
c17877	and added to the tribe
c17878	into which they marry. So our
c17879	allotted inheritance would be taken away.
c17880	And when the Jubilee for the Israelites comes,
c17881	their inheritance will be added to the tribe
c17882	into which they marry
c17883	[and] taken away from the tribe of our fathers.”
c17884	So at the word of the LORD, Moses commanded the Israelites:
c17886	“The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks correctly.
c17887	This
c17888	is what the LORD has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad:
c17890	They may marry anyone they please,
c17891	provided they marry within a clan of the tribe of their father.
c17892	No inheritance in Israel may be transferred from tribe to tribe,
c17893	because each
c17894	of the Israelites is to retain the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
c17895	Every daughter
c17896	who possesses an inheritance from any Israelite tribe
c17897	must marry within a clan of the tribe of her father,
c17898	so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers.
c17899	No inheritance may be transferred from one tribe to another,
c17900	because each
c17901	tribe of Israel must retain its inheritance.”
c17902	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c17903	So the daughters of Zelophehad did
c17904	Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to cousins on their father’s side.
c17905	They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph,
c17906	and their inheritance remained within the tribe of their father’s clan.
c17907	These are the commandments and ordinances
c17908	that the LORD gave to the Israelites through Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
c17909	These are the words
c17910	that Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan, in the Arabah, opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.
c17911	It is an eleven-day [journey] from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir.
c17913	In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites everything
c17914	that the LORD had commanded him concerning them.
c17915	This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites,
c17916	who lived in Heshbon,
c17917	and then ... Og king of Bashan,
c17918	who lived in Ashtaroth.
c17919	at Edrei [had defeated]
c17920	On the east side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began
c17921	to explain this law,
c17922	saying:
c17923	“The LORD our God said to us at Horeb:
c17925	long enough.
c17926	You have stayed at this mountain
c17927	Resume
c17928	your journey
c17929	and go to the hill country of the Amorites;
c17930	[go] to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the foothills, in the Negev, and along the seacoast
c17931	to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great River Euphrates.
c17932	See,
c17933	I have placed the land before you.
c17934	Enter
c17935	and possess the land
c17936	that the LORD swore ... to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
c17937	He would give ... and to their descendants after them.”
c17938	At that time I said to you,
c17940	“I cannot ... alone.
c17941	carry the burden for you
c17942	The LORD your God has multiplied you,
c17943	so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky.
c17944	May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times over
c17945	and bless you
c17946	as He has promised.
c17947	But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes all by myself?
c17948	Choose for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes,
c17949	and I will appoint them as your leaders.”
c17950	And you answered me
c17951	and said,
c17952	is good.”
c17953	“What you propose
c17954	to do
c17955	So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and respected men,
c17956	and appointed them as leaders over you—
c17957	as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, and as officers for your tribes.
c17958	At that time I charged your judges:
c17960	“Hear the disputes between your brothers,
c17961	and judge fairly between a man and his brother or a foreign resident.
c17962	Show no partiality in judging;
c17963	hear [both] small and great alike.
c17964	Do not be intimidated by anyone,
c17965	for judgment
c17966	belongs to God.
c17967	any case
c17968	too difficult for you,
c17969	And bring to me
c17970	and I will hear it.”
c17971	And at that time I commanded you all the things
c17972	you were to do.
c17973	we set out from Horeb
c17974	and went ... through all the vast and terrifying wilderness
c17975	And just as ... you have seen.
c17976	toward the hill country of the Amorites,
c17977	the LORD our God had commanded us,
c17978	When we reached Kadesh-barnea,
c17979	I said:
c17980	“You have reached the hill country of the Amorites,
c17981	which the LORD our God is giving us.
c17982	See,
c17983	the LORD your God has placed the land before you.
c17984	Go up
c17985	and take possession of
c17986	it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you.
c17987	Do not be afraid
c17988	or discouraged.”
c17989	Then all of you approached
c17990	me and said,
c17991	“Let us send men ahead of us
c17992	to search out the land
c17993	and bring us word of what route
c17994	to follow
c17995	and which cities
c17996	to enter.”
c17997	The plan seemed good to me,
c17998	so I selected twelve ... from among you,
c17999	men ... one from each tribe.
c18000	They left
c18001	and went up into the hill country,
c18002	and came to the Valley of Eshcol
c18003	and spied out [the land].
c18004	They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands,
c18005	carried it down to us,
c18006	and brought us word:
c18008	“It is a good land
c18009	that the LORD our God is giving us.”
c18010	But you were unwilling
c18011	to go up;
c18012	you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.
c18013	You grumbled in your tents
c18014	and said,
c18015	“Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt
c18016	to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites
c18017	to be annihilated.
c18018	Where can we go?
c18019	Our brothers have made our hearts melt,
c18020	saying:
c18021	‘The people
c18022	are larger and taller than we are;
c18023	the cities
c18024	are large, with walls up to the heavens.
c18025	We even saw the descendants of the Anakim there.’”
c18026	So I said to you:
c18027	“Do not be terrified
c18028	or afraid of them!
c18029	The LORD your God,
c18030	who goes before you,
c18031	will fight for you, just as
c18032	you saw Him do for you in Egypt
c18033	in the wilderness,
c18034	[and] ... where
c18035	the LORD your God carried you, as
c18036	a man carries his son,
c18037	all the way
c18038	by which you traveled
c18039	until you reached this place.”
c18040	But in spite of all this, you did not trust the LORD your God,
c18041	who went before you on the journey,
c18042	to seek out a place
c18043	for you to camp
c18044	in the fire by night
c18045	[and] to show you the road
c18046	to travel.
c18047	and in the cloud by day,
c18048	When the LORD heard your words,
c18049	He grew angry
c18050	and swore an oath,
c18051	saying,
c18052	“Not one of the men of this evil generation shall see the good land
c18053	I swore
c18054	to give your fathers,
c18055	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
c18056	He will see it,
c18057	and I will give him ... the land
c18058	on which he has set foot,
c18059	and his descendants
c18060	because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly.”
c18061	The LORD was also angry with me on your account,
c18062	and He said,
c18063	“Not even you shall enter [the land].
c18064	Joshua son of Nun,
c18065	who stands before you,
c18066	will enter it. ... he
c18067	Encourage him,
c18068	for ... will enable Israel to inherit [the land].
c18069	And the little ones,
c18070	whom you said
c18071	would become captives—
c18072	your children
c18073	who do not know good from evil,
c18074	will enter [the land] ... and
c18075	I give them
c18076	possess it.
c18077	But you are to turn back
c18078	and head for the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea.”
c18079	you replied.
c18081	“We have sinned against the LORD,” ... “We
c18082	will go up
c18083	and fight,
c18084	as
c18085	the LORD our God has commanded us.”
c18086	of you put on
c18087	Then each ... his weapons of war,
c18088	thinking it easy
c18089	to go up into the hill country.
c18090	But the LORD said to me,
c18091	“Tell them
c18092	not to go up
c18093	and fight, ... to keep you from
c18094	for I am not with
c18095	you ... defeat by your enemies.”
c18096	So I spoke to you,
c18097	but you would not listen.
c18098	You rebelled against the command of the LORD
c18099	and presumptuously
c18100	went up into the hill country.
c18101	Then the Amorites ... came out
c18102	who lived in the hills
c18103	against you
c18104	and chased
c18105	you like a swarm of bees.
c18106	They routed you from Seir all the way to Hormah.
c18107	And you returned
c18108	and wept before the LORD,
c18109	but [He] would not listen to your voice
c18110	[or] give ear to you.
c18111	For this reason you stayed in Kadesh for a long time— a very long time.
c18113	Then we turned back
c18114	and headed for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea,
c18115	as the LORD had instructed me,
c18116	and for many days we wandered around the hill country of Seir.
c18117	And the LORD then said to me,
c18119	long enough;
c18120	“You have been wandering around this hill country
c18121	turn to the north
c18122	and command the people:
c18124	‘You will pass through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau,
c18125	who live in Seir.
c18126	They will be afraid of you,
c18127	so you must be very careful.
c18128	Do not provoke them,
c18129	for I will not give you any of their land, not even a footprint,
c18130	because I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his possession.
c18131	You are to pay them in silver for the food
c18132	you eat
c18133	and the water
c18134	you drink.’”
c18135	Indeed, the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands.
c18136	He has watched over
c18137	your journey through this vast wilderness. ... these forty years,
c18138	The LORD your God has been with you
c18139	and you have lacked nothing.
c18140	So we passed by our brothers, the descendants of Esau,
c18141	who live in Seir.
c18142	from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion-geber,
c18143	We turned away
c18144	and traveled along the road of the Wilderness of Moab.
c18145	Then the LORD said to me,
c18146	‘Do not harass the Moabites
c18147	[or] provoke them to war,
c18148	for I will not give you any of their land,
c18149	because I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot.
c18150	(The Emites used to live there, a people great and many, as tall as the Anakites.
c18151	Like the Anakites, they were also regarded as Rephaim,
c18152	though the Moabites called them Emites.
c18153	The Horites used to live in Seir,
c18154	but the descendants of Esau drove them out,
c18155	destroying them completely
c18156	and settling in their place,
c18157	just as Israel did in the land ... as their possession.)
c18158	the LORD gave them
c18159	Now arise
c18160	and cross over the Brook of Zered.”
c18161	So we crossed over the Brook of Zered.
c18162	The time
c18163	we spent traveling from Kadesh-barnea
c18164	until we crossed over the Brook of Zered ... as
c18165	was thirty-eight years,
c18166	until that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp,
c18167	the LORD had sworn to them.
c18168	Indeed, the LORD’s hand was against them,
c18169	to eliminate them from the camp,
c18170	until they had all perished.
c18171	Now
c18172	when all the fighting men
c18173	had died,
c18174	among the people
c18175	the LORD said to me,
c18177	“Today you are going to cross the border of Moab at Ar.
c18178	But when you get close to the Ammonites,
c18179	do not harass them
c18180	or provoke them,
c18181	for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites,
c18182	because I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.
c18183	(That too was regarded as the land of the Rephaim,
c18184	[who] used to live there,
c18185	though the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.
c18186	[They were] a people great and many, as tall as the Anakites.
c18187	But the LORD destroyed them before [the Ammonites],
c18188	who drove them out
c18189	and settled in their place,
c18190	just as He had done for the descendants of Esau
c18191	who lived in Seir,
c18192	when He destroyed the Horites before them.
c18193	They drove them out
c18194	and have lived in their place to this day.
c18195	And the Avvim,
c18196	who lived in villages as far as Gaza,
c18197	the Caphtorites,
c18198	who came out of Caphtor
c18199	were destroyed by
c18200	and settled in their place.)
c18201	Arise,
c18202	set out,
c18203	and cross the Arnon Valley.
c18204	See,
c18205	I have handed Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land over to you.
c18206	Begin
c18207	to take possession of it
c18208	and engage him in battle.
c18209	This very day I will begin
c18210	to put the dread and fear of you upon all the nations under heaven.
c18211	They will hear the reports of you
c18212	and tremble
c18213	in anguish because of you.”
c18214	So from the Wilderness of Kedemoth I sent messengers with an offer of peace to Sihon king of Heshbon,
c18215	saying,
c18216	“Let us pass through your land;
c18217	we will stay on the main road.
c18218	We will not turn to the right or to the left.
c18219	You can sell us food
c18220	to eat
c18221	[and] water ... in exchange for silver.
c18222	to drink
c18223	Only let us pass through on foot,
c18224	just as the descendants of Esau ... did for us,
c18225	who live in Seir
c18226	and the Moabites
c18227	who live in Ar
c18228	until we cross the Jordan into the land
c18229	the LORD our God is giving us.”
c18230	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not
c18231	let us pass through,
c18232	for the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn
c18233	and his heart obstinate,
c18234	that He might give him into your hands,
c18235	as is the case this day.
c18236	Then the LORD said to me,
c18237	“See,
c18238	I have begun
c18239	to deliver Sihon and his land to you. Now
c18240	begin
c18241	to conquer
c18242	and possess his land.”
c18243	So Sihon ... came out
c18244	against us
c18245	and his whole army ... for battle ... at Jahaz.
c18246	And the LORD our God delivered him over to us,
c18247	and we defeated him and his sons and his whole army.
c18248	At that time we captured all his cities
c18249	and completely destroyed the people of every city, including women and children.
c18250	We left no survivors.
c18251	We carried off for ourselves only the livestock
c18252	and the plunder from the cities
c18253	we captured.
c18254	From Aroer
c18255	on the rim of the Arnon Valley,
c18256	along with the city
c18257	in the valley,
c18258	even as far as Gilead, not one city [had walls]
c18259	too high for us.
c18260	The LORD our God gave us all of them.
c18261	But you did not go near the land of the Ammonites, or [the land] along the banks of the Jabbok River, or the cities of the hill country, or any
c18262	place that the LORD our God had forbidden.
c18263	Then we turned
c18264	and went up the road to Bashan,
c18265	and Og king of Bashan ... came out
c18266	to meet us
c18267	and his whole army ... in battle at Edrei.
c18268	But the LORD said to me,
c18269	“Do not fear him,
c18270	for I have handed him over to you along with all his people and his land.
c18271	Do
c18272	to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
c18273	who lived in Heshbon.”
c18274	So the LORD our God also handed over Og king of Bashan and his whole army to us.
c18275	We struck them down
c18276	until no survivor was left.
c18277	At that time we captured all ... of his cities.
c18278	There was not a single city
c18279	we failed to take—
c18280	sixty ... the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
c18281	All these cities were fortified with high walls and gates and bars, and there were many more unwalled villages.
c18282	We completely destroyed them,
c18283	as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon,
c18284	destroying the men, women, and children of every city.
c18285	But all the livestock and plunder of the cities we carried off for ourselves.
c18286	At that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites the land
c18287	across the Jordan,
c18288	from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon—
c18289	which the Sidonians call Sirion
c18290	but the Amorites call Senir—
c18291	all the cities of the plateau, [all] Gilead, and all Bashan as far as the cities of Salecah and Edrei in the kingdom of Og.
c18292	(For only Og king of Bashan had remained of the remnant of the Rephaim.
c18293	His bed of iron,
c18294	[is still] in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)
c18295	nine cubits long
c18296	and four cubits wide,
c18297	So at that time we took possession of this land.
c18298	[the land] beyond Aroer
c18299	along the Arnon Valley,
c18300	To the Reubenites and Gadites I gave ... and half the hill country of Gilead, along with its cities.
c18301	To the half-tribe of Manasseh I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og. (The entire region of Argob,
c18302	the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim.)
c18303	Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites.
c18304	He named ... after himself,
c18305	Bashan ... Havvoth-jair, by which [it is called] to this day.
c18306	To Machir I gave Gilead,
c18307	and to the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border)
c18308	and up to the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites.
c18309	The Jordan [River] in the Arabah bordered it from Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) with the slopes of Pisgah to the east.
c18310	At that time I commanded you:
c18312	“The LORD your God has given you this land
c18313	to possess.
c18314	your warriors are to cross over, armed for battle, ahead of your brothers,
c18315	All ... the Israelites.
c18316	But your wives, your children, and your livestock—
c18317	I know
c18318	that you have a lot of livestock—
c18319	may remain in the cities
c18320	I have given you,
c18321	until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as He has to you,
c18322	and they too have taken possession of the land
c18323	the LORD your God is giving them, across the Jordan.
c18324	of you may return
c18325	Then each ... to the possession
c18326	I have given you.”
c18327	And at that time I commanded Joshua:
c18329	“Your own eyes
c18330	have seen all
c18331	that the LORD your God has done to these two kings.
c18332	The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms
c18333	you are about to enter.
c18334	Do not be afraid of them,
c18335	for the LORD your God
c18336	Himself
c18337	will fight for you.”
c18338	At that time I also pleaded with the LORD:
c18340	“O Lord GOD,
c18341	You have begun
c18342	to show Your greatness and power to Your servant.
c18343	For what god in heaven or on earth
c18344	can perform such works and mighty acts [as Yours]?
c18345	Please let me cross over
c18346	and see the beautiful land
c18347	beyond the Jordan—
c18348	that wonderful hill country and Lebanon!”
c18349	But the LORD was angry with me on account of you,
c18350	and He would not listen to me.
c18351	the LORD said to me.
c18352	“That is enough,”
c18353	“Do not ... Me
c18354	speak to ... again about this matter.
c18355	Go to the top of Pisgah
c18356	and look to the west and north and south and east.
c18357	See [the land] with your own eyes,
c18358	for you will not cross this Jordan.
c18359	But commission Joshua,
c18360	and encourage
c18361	and strengthen him,
c18362	for he will cross over ahead of the people
c18363	and enable them to inherit the land
c18364	that you will see.”
c18365	So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
c18366	now, O Israel,
c18367	Hear ... the statutes and ordinances
c18368	I am teaching you
c18369	to follow
c18370	so that you may live,
c18371	enter,
c18372	and take possession of the land
c18373	that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.
c18374	You must not add to
c18375	what I command you,
c18376	or subtract from
c18377	so that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God
c18378	I am giving you.
c18379	Your eyes
c18380	have seen
c18381	what the LORD did at Baal-peor,
c18382	for ... all
c18383	who followed Baal of Peor.
c18384	the LORD your God destroyed from among you
c18385	But you
c18386	who held fast to the LORD your God
c18387	[are] alive to this day, every one of you.
c18388	See,
c18389	I have taught you statutes and ordinances
c18390	just as the LORD my God has commanded me,
c18391	so that you may follow them in the land
c18392	you are about to enter
c18393	and possess.
c18394	carefully,
c18395	Observe them
c18396	for this will show your wisdom and understanding in the sight of the peoples,
c18397	who shall hear of all these statutes
c18398	and say,
c18399	“Surely this great nation [is] a wise and understanding people.”
c18400	For what nation [is so] great
c18401	as to have a god
c18402	[as] near to them
c18403	as the LORD our God is to us whenever
c18404	we call on Him?
c18405	And what nation [is so] great
c18406	as to have righteous statutes and ordinances like this entire law
c18407	I set before you today?
c18408	Only be on your guard
c18409	and diligently watch yourselves,
c18410	so that you do not forget the things
c18411	your eyes have seen,
c18412	and so that they do not slip from your heart as long as you live.
c18413	Teach them to your children and grandchildren.
c18414	The day
c18415	you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, ... so that
c18416	the LORD said to me,
c18417	“Gather the people before Me
c18418	to hear My words,
c18419	they may learn
c18420	to fear Me all the days
c18421	they live on the earth,
c18422	and that they may teach them to their children.”
c18423	You came near
c18424	and stood at the foot of the mountain,
c18425	a mountain blazing with fire to the heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.
c18426	And the LORD spoke to you out of the fire.
c18427	You heard the sound of the words,
c18428	but saw no form;
c18429	there was only a voice.
c18430	He declared to you His covenant,
c18431	He commanded
c18432	you to follow,
c18433	the Ten Commandments
c18434	which He wrote on two tablets of stone.
c18435	At that time the LORD commanded me
c18436	to teach you the statutes and ordinances
c18437	you are to follow in the land
c18438	into which you are crossing
c18439	to possess.
c18440	be careful
c18441	So since you saw no form of any kind on the day
c18442	the LORD spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb,
c18443	that you do not act corruptly
c18444	and make an idol for yourselves of any form or shape, whether in the likeness of a male or female,
c18445	of any beast
c18446	on the earth ... that
c18447	or bird
c18448	flies in the air,
c18449	[or] of any
c18450	creature that crawls on the ground
c18451	or fish
c18452	in the waters below.
c18453	When you look to the heavens ... do not
c18454	and see the sun and moon and stars— all the host of heaven—
c18455	be enticed
c18456	to bow down
c18457	and worship
c18458	what the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.
c18459	Yet the LORD has taken you
c18460	and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt,
c18461	to be the people of His inheritance,
c18462	as you are today.
c18463	The LORD, however, was angry with me on account of you,
c18464	and He swore
c18465	that I would not cross the Jordan
c18466	and enter the good land
c18467	that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
c18468	because I must die in this land.
c18469	For I will not be crossing the Jordan,
c18470	But you shall cross over
c18471	and take possession of that good land.
c18472	Be careful
c18473	that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God
c18474	that He made with you;
c18475	do not make an idol for yourselves in the form of anything
c18476	He has forbidden you.
c18477	For the LORD your God
c18478	is a consuming fire,
c18479	a jealous God.
c18480	After you have children and grandchildren
c18481	and you have been in the land a long time,
c18482	if you then act corruptly
c18483	and make an idol in the form of anything,
c18484	doing
c18485	evil in the sight of the LORD your God
c18486	[and] provoking Him to anger,
c18487	I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day
c18488	that you will quickly perish from the land
c18489	you are crossing the Jordan
c18490	to possess.
c18491	You will not live long upon it,
c18492	but will be utterly destroyed.
c18493	Then the LORD will scatter you among the peoples,
c18494	and only a few of you will survive among the nations
c18495	to which the LORD will drive you.
c18496	And there you will serve man-made gods of wood and stone,
c18497	which cannot see
c18498	[or] hear
c18499	[or] eat
c18500	[or] smell.
c18501	But if from there you will seek the LORD your God,
c18502	you will find
c18503	Him if you seek Him with all your heart and all your soul.
c18504	When you are in distress
c18505	and all these things have happened to you, then in later days
c18506	you will return to the LORD your God
c18507	and listen to His voice.
c18508	For the LORD your God [is] a merciful God;
c18509	He will not abandon you
c18510	[or] destroy you
c18511	[or] forget the covenant with your fathers,
c18512	which He swore to them by oath.
c18513	Indeed, ask now ... about the days ... long
c18514	that ... preceded you,
c18515	from the day
c18516	that God created man on earth:
c18517	from one end of the heavens to [the other]
c18518	Has anything as great as this ever happened
c18519	or been reported?
c18520	Has a people ever heard the voice of God
c18521	speaking out of the fire,
c18522	as you have,
c18523	and lived?
c18524	Or has any god tried
c18526	to take as his own a nation out of another nation— by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors— as
c18527	the LORD your God did for you in Egypt, before your eyes?
c18528	You were shown [these things]
c18529	so that you would know
c18530	that the LORD
c18531	is God;
c18532	there is no other besides Him.
c18533	He let you hear His voice from heaven
c18534	to discipline you,
c18535	and on earth He showed you His great fire,
c18536	and you heard His words out of the fire.
c18537	Because He loved your fathers,
c18538	He chose their descendants after them
c18539	and brought you out of Egypt by His presence and great power,
c18540	to drive out before you nations greater and mightier [than you],
c18541	and to bring you
c18542	into their land and give it as your inheritance,
c18543	as it is today.
c18544	Know therefore this day
c18545	and take to heart
c18546	that the LORD
c18547	is God in heaven above and on the earth below;
c18548	there is no other.
c18549	Keep His statutes and commandments,
c18550	which I am giving you today,
c18551	so that you and your children after you may prosper,
c18552	and that you may live long in the land
c18553	the LORD your God is giving you for all time.”
c18554	Then Moses set aside three cities across the Jordan to the east
c18555	to which a manslayer could flee
c18556	after killing his neighbor unintentionally
c18557	without prior malice.
c18558	he could flee to one of these cities:
c18559	To save his own life,
c18560	Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau belonging to the Reubenites,
c18561	Ramoth in Gilead belonging to the Gadites,
c18562	or Golan in Bashan belonging to the Manassites.
c18563	This is the law
c18564	Moses set before the Israelites.
c18565	These [are] the testimonies, statutes, and ordinances
c18566	Moses proclaimed to them
c18567	after they had come out of Egypt,
c18568	while they were in the valley across the Jordan facing Beth-peor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites,
c18569	who lived in Heshbon
c18570	and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites
c18571	after they had come out of Egypt.
c18572	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan— the two Amorite kings
c18573	who were across the Jordan to the east—
c18574	extending from Aroer
c18575	on the rim of the Arnon Valley
c18576	as far as Mount Siyon
c18577	(that is, Hermon),
c18578	including all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan and as far as the sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah.
c18579	Then Moses summoned all Israel ... to them,
c18580	and said
c18581	“Hear,
c18582	O Israel,
c18583	the statutes and ordinances
c18584	that I declare in your hearing this day.
c18585	Learn them
c18586	them carefully.
c18587	and observe
c18588	The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
c18589	He did not make this covenant with our fathers,
c18590	but with
c18591	all of us who are alive here today.
c18592	The LORD spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.
c18593	At that time I was standing between the LORD and you
c18594	to declare to you the word of the LORD,
c18595	because you were afraid of the fire
c18596	and would not go up the mountain.
c18597	And He said:
c18598	“I am the LORD your God,
c18599	who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
c18600	You shall have no other gods before Me.
c18601	You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything
c18602	in the heavens above
c18603	or on the earth beneath
c18604	or in the waters below.
c18605	You shall not bow down to them
c18606	or worship them;
c18607	for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God,
c18608	visiting the iniquity of the fathers on their children, to the third and fourth [generations] of those who hate Me,
c18609	but showing loving devotion to a thousand [generations] of those who love Me and keep My commandments.
c18610	You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain,
c18611	for the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished
c18612	who takes His name in vain.
c18613	Remember the Sabbath day
c18614	by keeping it holy,
c18615	as the LORD your God has commanded you.
c18616	Six days you shall labor
c18617	and do all your work,
c18618	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God,
c18619	on which you must not do any work— neither you, nor your son [or] daughter, nor your manservant [or] maidservant, nor your ox or donkey or any of your livestock, nor the foreigner
c18620	within your gates,
c18621	so that your manservant and maidservant may rest as you do.
c18622	Remember
c18623	that you were a slave in the land of Egypt,
c18624	and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and outstretched arm.
c18625	That is why the LORD your God has commanded
c18626	you to keep the Sabbath day.
c18627	Honor your father and your mother,
c18628	as the LORD your God has commanded you,
c18629	so that your days may be long
c18630	and that it may go well with you in the land
c18631	the LORD your God is giving you.
c18632	You shall not murder.
c18633	You shall not commit adultery.
c18634	You shall not steal.
c18635	You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
c18636	You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.
c18637	You shall not covet your neighbor’s house or field, or his manservant or maidservant, or his ox or donkey, or anything
c18638	that belongs to your neighbor.”
c18639	The LORD spoke these commandments in a loud voice to your whole assembly out of the fire, the cloud, and the deep darkness on the mountain;
c18640	He added nothing more.
c18641	And He wrote them on two tablets of stone
c18642	and gave them to me.
c18644	And when you heard the voice out of the darkness,
c18645	while the mountain was blazing with fire,
c18646	approached me,
c18647	all the heads of your tribes and your elders
c18648	and you said,
c18649	“Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and greatness,
c18650	and we have heard His voice out of the fire.
c18651	Today we have seen
c18652	that God can speak with a man,
c18653	yet [the man] lives.
c18654	But now,
c18655	why should we die?
c18656	For this great fire will consume us,
c18657	if we ... any longer.
c18658	hear the voice of the LORD our God
c18659	and we will die,
c18660	For who of all flesh
c18661	has heard the voice of the living God
c18662	speaking out of the fire,
c18663	as we [have],
c18664	and survived?
c18665	Go near ... Then you
c18666	and listen to all
c18667	that the LORD our God says.
c18668	can tell us everything
c18669	the LORD our God tells you;
c18670	we will listen
c18671	and obey.”
c18672	And the LORD heard the words
c18673	you spoke to me,
c18674	and [He] said to me,
c18675	“I have heard the words ... these people
c18676	that ... have spoken to you.
c18677	They have done well in all
c18678	that they have spoken.
c18679	If only
c18680	they had such a heart
c18681	to fear Me
c18682	and keep all My commandments always,
c18683	so that it might be well with them and their children forever.
c18684	Go
c18685	and tell them:
c18686	‘Return to your tents.’
c18687	But you
c18688	stand here with Me,
c18689	that I may speak to you all the commandments and statutes and ordinances
c18690	you are to teach them
c18691	to follow in the land
c18692	I am giving them
c18693	to possess.”
c18694	So be careful
c18695	to do
c18696	as the LORD your God has commanded you;
c18697	you are not to turn aside to the right or to the left.
c18698	in all the ways
c18699	that the LORD your God has commanded you,
c18700	You must walk
c18701	so that you may live
c18702	and prosper
c18703	and prolong [your] days in the land
c18704	you will possess.
c18705	These are the commandments and statutes and ordinances
c18706	that the LORD your God has instructed
c18707	me to teach you
c18708	to follow in the land
c18709	you are about to enter
c18710	and possess,
c18711	so that you ... may fear the LORD your God
c18712	all ... by keeping ... His statutes and commandments
c18713	that I give
c18714	and your children and grandchildren ... the days of your lives ... all ... you,
c18715	and so that your days may be prolonged.
c18716	Hear,
c18717	O Israel,
c18718	and be careful
c18719	to observe them,
c18720	so that you may prosper
c18721	and multiply greatly
c18722	just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
c18723	in a land flowing with milk and honey,
c18724	Hear,
c18725	O Israel:
c18726	The LORD our God,
c18727	the LORD is One.
c18728	And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
c18729	These words ... are to be
c18730	I am commanding you today
c18731	upon your hearts.
c18732	And you shall teach them diligently to your children
c18733	and speak of them
c18734	when you sit in your house
c18735	and when you walk along the road,
c18736	when you lie down
c18737	and when you get up.
c18738	Tie them as reminders on your hands
c18739	and bind them on your foreheads.
c18740	Write them on the doorposts of your houses
c18741	and on your gates.
c18743	And when the LORD your God brings you into the land
c18744	He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ... that
c18745	that He would give you—
c18746	[a land with] great and splendid cities
c18747	you did not build,
c18748	with houses
c18749	full of every good
c18750	thing with which you did not fill them,
c18751	with wells
c18752	that you did not dig,
c18753	and with vineyards and olive groves
c18754	that you did not plant—
c18755	and when you eat
c18756	and are satisfied,
c18757	be careful
c18758	not to forget the LORD
c18759	who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
c18760	Fear the LORD your God,
c18761	serve Him,
c18762	and take your oaths using only His name.
c18763	Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples
c18764	around you.
c18765	For the LORD your God, who is among you, is a jealous God.
c18766	Otherwise, the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you,
c18767	and He will wipe you off the face of the earth.
c18768	Do not test the LORD your God
c18769	as you tested Him at Massah.
c18770	You are to diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God and the testimonies and statutes
c18771	He has commanded you.
c18772	Do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD,
c18773	so that it may be well with you
c18774	and that you may enter
c18775	and possess the good land
c18776	which the LORD your God swore to give your fathers,
c18777	driving out all your enemies before you,
c18778	as the LORD has said.
c18779	In the future, when your son asks you,
c18781	“What is the meaning of the decrees and statutes and ordinances
c18782	the LORD our God has commanded you?”
c18783	then you are to tell him,
c18784	“We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt,
c18785	but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
c18786	Before our eyes the LORD inflicted great and devastating signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his household,
c18787	but He brought us from there
c18788	to lead us in
c18789	and give us the land
c18790	that He had sworn to our fathers.
c18791	And the LORD commanded us
c18792	to observe all these statutes
c18793	and to fear the LORD our God,
c18794	that we might always prosper
c18795	and be preserved,
c18796	[as we are] this day.
c18797	will be our righteousness.”
c18798	And if we are careful ... then that
c18799	to observe every one of these commandments before the LORD our God
c18800	just as He has commanded us,
c18801	When the LORD your God brings you into the land
c18802	you are entering
c18803	to possess,
c18804	and He drives out before you many nations— the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations
c18805	larger and stronger [than you]—
c18806	and when the LORD your God has delivered them over to you
c18807	to defeat them,
c18808	then you must completely destroy them.
c18809	Make no treaty with them
c18810	and show them no mercy.
c18811	Do not intermarry with them.
c18812	Do not give your daughters to their sons
c18813	or take their daughters for your sons,
c18814	because they will turn your sons away from following Me
c18815	to serve other gods.
c18816	Then the anger of the LORD will burn against you,
c18817	and He will swiftly destroy you.
c18818	Instead, this is what you are to do to them:
c18819	tear down their altars,
c18820	smash their sacred pillars,
c18821	cut down their Asherah poles,
c18822	and burn their idols in the fire.
c18823	For you are a people holy unto the LORD your God.
c18824	The LORD your God has chosen
c18825	you to be as a people for His prized possession,
c18826	above all peoples
c18827	on the face of the earth.
c18828	did not
c18829	because you were more numerous than the other peoples,
c18830	The LORD ... set His affection on you
c18831	[and] choose you
c18832	for you were the fewest of all peoples.
c18833	But
c18834	because the LORD loved you
c18835	and kept the oath
c18836	He swore to your fathers,
c18837	He brought you out with a mighty hand
c18838	and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
c18839	Know therefore
c18840	that the LORD your God
c18841	is God, the faithful God
c18842	who keeps His covenant with loving devotion for a thousand generations of those who love Him and keep His commandments.
c18843	But those who hate Him He repays to their faces
c18844	with destruction;
c18845	He will not hesitate ... the one who hates Him.
c18846	to repay to his face
c18847	So keep the commandments and statutes and ordinances
c18848	that I am giving you ... this day.
c18849	to follow
c18851	If you listen to these ordinances
c18852	and keep them carefully,
c18854	the LORD your God will keep His covenant with loving devotion,
c18855	as He swore to your fathers.
c18856	He will love you
c18857	and bless you
c18858	and multiply you.
c18859	He will bless the fruit of your womb and the produce of your land— your grain, new wine, and oil— the young of your herds, and the newborn of your flocks, in the land
c18860	that He swore to your fathers
c18861	to give you.
c18862	You will be blessed above all peoples;
c18863	among you there will be no barren man or woman
c18864	or livestock.
c18865	And the LORD will remove from you all sickness.
c18866	any of the terrible diseases ... in Egypt,
c18867	you knew
c18868	He will not lay upon you
c18869	but He will inflict them on all who hate you.
c18870	You must destroy all the peoples
c18871	the LORD your God will deliver to you.
c18872	Do not look on them with pity.
c18873	Do not worship their gods,
c18874	for that will be a snare to you.
c18875	You may say in your heart,
c18876	“These nations are greater than we are;
c18877	how can
c18878	we drive them out?”
c18879	But do not be afraid of them.
c18880	Be sure to remember
c18881	what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt:
c18882	the great trials
c18883	that you saw,
c18884	the signs and wonders, and the mighty hand and outstretched arm
c18885	by which the LORD your God brought you out.
c18886	The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples
c18887	you now fear.
c18888	Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet
c18889	against them until all the survivors and those hiding from you have perished.
c18890	Do not be terrified by them,
c18891	for the LORD your God, who [is] among you,
c18892	[is] a great and awesome God.
c18893	The LORD your God will drive out these nations before you little by little.
c18894	You will not be enabled
c18895	to eliminate them all at once,
c18896	or the wild animals would multiply around you.
c18897	But the LORD your God will give them over to you
c18898	and throw them into great confusion,
c18899	until they are destroyed.
c18900	He will hand their kings over to you,
c18901	and you will wipe out their names from under heaven.
c18902	No one will be able to stand against you;
c18903	you will annihilate them.
c18904	You must burn up the images of their gods;
c18905	do not covet the silver and gold [that is] on them
c18906	or take it for yourselves,
c18907	or you will be ensnared by it;
c18908	for it is detestable to the LORD your God.
c18909	And you must not bring any detestable thing into your house,
c18910	or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction.
c18911	You are to utterly detest
c18912	and abhor it,
c18913	because it is set apart for destruction.
c18914	every command
c18915	I am giving you today,
c18916	You must carefully
c18917	follow
c18918	so that you may live
c18919	and multiply,
c18920	and enter
c18921	and possess the land
c18922	the LORD swore to your fathers.
c18923	Remember that ... all the way
c18924	these forty years the LORD your God led you ... in the wilderness, ... what
c18925	so that He might humble you
c18926	and test you
c18927	in order to know
c18928	was in your heart,
c18929	you would keep His commandments.
c18930	whether or not
c18931	He humbled you,
c18932	and in your hunger
c18933	gave you manna to eat,
c18934	which neither ... had known,
c18935	you [nor] your fathers ... you might understand ... does not
c18936	so that
c18937	that man ... live on bread alone,
c18938	but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.
c18939	Your clothing did not wear out
c18940	and your feet did not swell during these forty years.
c18941	So know in your heart
c18942	that
c18943	just as a man disciplines his son,
c18944	[so] the LORD your God disciplines you.
c18945	Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God,
c18946	walking in His ways
c18947	and fearing Him.
c18948	For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks and fountains and springs
c18949	that flow through the valleys and hills;
c18950	a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey;
c18951	a land
c18952	where you will eat food without scarcity,
c18953	where you will lack nothing;
c18954	a land
c18955	whose rocks are iron
c18956	and whose hills can be mined for copper.
c18957	When you eat
c18958	and are satisfied,
c18959	you are to bless the LORD your God for the good land
c18960	He has given you.
c18961	Be careful
c18962	not to forget the LORD your God
c18963	by failing to keep His commandments and ordinances and statutes,
c18964	which I am giving you this day.
c18965	Otherwise, when you eat
c18966	and are satisfied,
c18967	when you build fine houses
c18968	in which to dwell,
c18969	and when your herds and flocks grow large,
c18970	and your silver and gold are multiplied,
c18971	and all
c18972	you have
c18973	increases,
c18974	then your heart will become proud,
c18975	and you will forget the LORD your God
c18976	who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
c18977	He led you through the vast and terrifying wilderness with its venomous snakes and scorpions, a thirsty
c18978	and waterless [land].
c18979	He brought you water from the rock of flint.
c18980	He fed you in the wilderness with manna
c18981	that your fathers had not known,
c18982	in order to humble you
c18983	and test you,
c18984	so that in the end He might cause you to prosper.
c18985	You may say in your heart,
c18986	“The power and the strength of my hand has made this wealth for me.”
c18987	But remember that it is the LORD your God
c18988	[who]
c18989	gives you the power
c18990	to gain wealth,
c18991	in order to confirm His covenant
c18992	that He swore to your fathers,
c18993	as it is this day.
c18995	If you ever forget the LORD your God
c18996	and go after other gods
c18997	to worship
c18998	and bow down to them,
c18999	I testify against you today
c19000	that you will surely perish.
c19001	Like the nations
c19002	the LORD has destroyed before you,
c19003	so you will perish
c19004	if you do not obey the LORD your God.
c19005	Hear,
c19006	O Israel.
c19007	Today you are about to cross the Jordan
c19008	to go in
c19009	and dispossess nations
c19010	greater and stronger than you,
c19011	cities
c19012	with large ... fortified to the heavens.
c19013	The people are strong and tall, the descendants of the Anakim.
c19014	You know about them
c19015	and you have heard it said,
c19016	“Who can stand up to the sons of Anak?”
c19017	But understand ... today
c19018	that ... the LORD your God
c19019	He
c19020	goes across ahead of you
c19021	as a consuming fire;
c19022	will destroy them
c19023	and subdue them before you.
c19024	And you will drive them out
c19025	and annihilate them swiftly,
c19026	as the LORD has told you.
c19027	do not say in your heart,
c19028	When the LORD your God has driven them out before you,
c19030	“Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in
c19031	to possess this land.”
c19032	Rather, the LORD will drive out these nations before you because of their wickedness.
c19033	It is not by your righteousness or uprightness of heart that you are going in
c19034	to possess their land,
c19035	but [it is] because of their wickedness that the LORD your God will drive out these nations before you,
c19036	to keep the promise
c19037	He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
c19038	Understand, then,
c19039	that it is not by your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land
c19040	to possess,
c19041	for you are a stiff-necked people.
c19042	Remember this
c19043	and never forget
c19044	how you provoked the LORD your God in the wilderness.
c19045	From the day
c19046	you left the land of Egypt
c19047	until you reached this place,
c19048	you have been rebelling against the LORD.
c19049	At Horeb you provoked the LORD,
c19050	and He was angry enough
c19051	to destroy you.
c19052	When I went up on the mountain
c19053	to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant
c19054	that the LORD made with you,
c19055	I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
c19056	I ate no bread
c19057	and drank no water.
c19058	Then the LORD gave me the two stone tablets,
c19059	inscribed by the finger of God
c19060	with the exact words
c19061	that the LORD spoke to you out of the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly.
c19062	And
c19063	at the end of forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant,
c19064	and the LORD said to me,
c19065	“Get up
c19066	and go down from here at once,
c19067	for your people ... have corrupted [themselves].
c19068	whom you brought out of Egypt
c19069	How quickly they have turned aside from the way
c19070	that I commanded them;
c19071	they have made for themselves a molten image.”
c19072	The LORD also said to me,
c19074	“I have seen this people,
c19075	and indeed, they are a stiff-necked people.
c19076	Let Me alone,
c19077	so that I may destroy them
c19078	and blot out their name from under heaven.
c19079	Then I will make you into a nation
c19080	mightier and greater than they.”
c19081	So I went back
c19082	down the mountain
c19083	while it was blazing with fire,
c19084	with the two tablets of the covenant in my hands.
c19085	And I saw
c19086	how
c19087	you had sinned against the LORD your God;
c19088	you had made for yourselves a molten calf.
c19089	You had turned aside quickly from the way
c19090	the LORD had commanded you.
c19091	So I took hold of the two tablets
c19092	and threw them out of my hands,
c19093	shattering them before your eyes.
c19094	Then I fell down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights, as [I had done] the first time.
c19095	I did not eat bread
c19096	or drink water because of all the sin
c19097	you had committed
c19098	in doing
c19099	what was evil in the LORD’s sight
c19100	and provoking Him to anger.
c19101	For I was afraid of the anger and wrath
c19102	that the LORD had directed against you,
c19103	enough to destroy you.
c19104	But the LORD listened to me this time as well.
c19105	The LORD was angry enough with Aaron
c19106	to destroy him,
c19107	but at that time I also prayed for Aaron.
c19108	And ... sinful thing,
c19109	that ... you had made,
c19110	I took ... the calf
c19111	and burned it in the fire.
c19112	Then I crushed it
c19113	[and] ground
c19114	it to powder as fine as dust,
c19115	and I cast it into the stream
c19116	that came down from the mountain.
c19117	You continued to provoke the LORD at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah.
c19118	And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh-barnea,
c19119	He said,
c19120	“Go up
c19121	and possess the land
c19122	I have given you.”
c19123	But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.
c19124	You neither believed [Him]
c19125	nor obeyed Him.
c19126	You have been rebelling against the LORD from the day
c19127	I knew you.
c19128	So I fell down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights
c19130	because the LORD had said
c19131	He would destroy you.
c19132	And I prayed to the LORD
c19133	and said,
c19134	“O Lord GOD,
c19135	do not destroy Your people, Your inheritance,
c19136	whom You redeemed through Your greatness
c19137	and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
c19138	Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
c19139	Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and sin.
c19140	Otherwise, those in the land ... will say,
c19141	from which you brought us out
c19142	‘Because the LORD was not able
c19143	to bring them into the land
c19144	He had promised them,
c19145	and because He hated them,
c19146	He has brought them out
c19147	to kill them in the wilderness.’
c19148	But they are Your people, Your inheritance,
c19149	whom You brought out by Your great power and outstretched arm.”
c19150	At that time the LORD said to me,
c19151	“Chisel two stone tablets like the first ones,
c19152	come up to Me on the mountain,
c19153	and make an ark of wood.
c19154	And I will write on the tablets the words
c19155	that were on the first tablets,
c19156	which you broke;
c19157	and you are to place them in the ark.”
c19158	So I made an ark of acacia wood,
c19159	cut two stone tablets like the first ones,
c19160	and climbed the mountain
c19161	with the two tablets in my hands.
c19162	And [the LORD] wrote on the tablets what had been written previously, the Ten Commandments
c19163	that He had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly.
c19164	The LORD gave them to me,
c19165	and I went back
c19166	down the mountain
c19167	and placed the tablets in the ark
c19168	I had made, as
c19169	and there they have remained.
c19170	the LORD had commanded me,
c19171	The Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah,
c19172	where Aaron died
c19173	and was buried,
c19174	and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest.
c19175	From there they traveled to Gudgodah,
c19176	and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.
c19177	At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi
c19178	to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
c19179	to stand before the LORD
c19180	to serve Him,
c19181	and to pronounce blessings in His name, as [they do] to this day.
c19182	That is why Levi has no portion or inheritance among his brothers;
c19183	the LORD
c19184	is his inheritance,
c19185	as the LORD your God promised him.
c19186	I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, like the first time,
c19187	and that time the LORD again listened to me
c19188	[and] agreed not
c19189	to destroy you.
c19190	Then the LORD said to me,
c19191	“Get up.
c19192	Continue your journey ahead of the people,
c19193	that they may enter
c19194	and possess the land
c19195	I swore to their fathers
c19196	to give them.”
c19197	“And now,
c19198	O Israel,
c19199	what does the LORD your God ask of you
c19200	but
c19201	to fear the LORD your God
c19202	by walking in all His ways,
c19203	to love Him,
c19204	to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
c19205	[and] to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD,
c19206	which I am giving you this day
c19207	for your own good?
c19208	Behold,
c19209	to the LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, and the earth and everything in it.
c19211	Yet the LORD has set His affection on your fathers
c19212	and loved them.
c19213	And He has chosen you, their descendants after them, above all the peoples, even to this day.
c19214	Circumcise your hearts, therefore,
c19215	and stiffen your necks no more.
c19216	For the LORD your God
c19217	is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God,
c19218	showing no partiality
c19219	and accepting no bribe.
c19220	He executes justice for the fatherless and widow,
c19221	and He loves the foreigner,
c19222	giving him food and clothing.
c19223	So you also must love the foreigner,
c19224	since you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
c19225	You are to fear the LORD your God
c19226	and serve Him.
c19227	Hold fast to Him
c19228	and take your oaths in His name.
c19229	He is your praise
c19230	and He is your God,
c19231	who has done for you these great and awesome wonders
c19232	your eyes have seen.
c19233	Your fathers went down to Egypt, seventy in all,
c19234	and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
c19235	You shall therefore love the LORD your God
c19236	and always keep His charge, His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments.
c19237	Know this day
c19238	that it is not your children
c19239	who have known
c19240	and seen the discipline of the LORD your God: His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm;
c19241	the signs and works
c19242	He did in Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and all his land;
c19243	what He did to the Egyptian army and horses and chariots
c19244	when He made the waters of the Red Sea engulf them
c19245	as they pursued you,
c19246	and [how] He destroyed them completely, even to this day;
c19247	what He did for you in the wilderness
c19248	until you reached this place;
c19249	and what He did ... to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the Reubenite,
c19250	when the earth opened its mouth
c19251	and swallowed them,
c19252	of all ... their households, their tents, ... living thing
c19253	that belonged to them.
c19254	in the midst ... the Israelites ... and every
c19255	For [it is] your own eyes
c19256	[that] have seen every great work ... the LORD
c19257	that ... has done.
c19258	You shall therefore keep every commandment
c19259	I am giving you today,
c19260	so that you may have the strength
c19261	to go in
c19262	and possess the land
c19263	you
c19264	are to inherit,
c19265	and so that you may live long in the land
c19266	the LORD swore to your fathers
c19267	to give them and their descendants,
c19268	a land flowing with milk and honey.
c19269	For the land
c19270	you are entering
c19271	to possess
c19272	is not like the land of Egypt, from which
c19273	you have come, where
c19274	you sowed your seed
c19275	and irrigated on foot, like a vegetable garden.
c19276	But the land
c19277	you are entering
c19278	to possess
c19279	is a land of mountains and valleys
c19280	that drinks in the rain from heaven.
c19281	It is a land
c19282	the LORD your God cares for;
c19283	the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning to the end of the year.
c19284	So
c19285	if you carefully obey the commandments
c19286	I am giving you today,
c19287	to love the LORD your God
c19288	and to serve Him with all your heart and all your soul,
c19289	then I will provide rain for your land in season, the autumn and spring rains,
c19290	that you may gather your grain, new wine, and oil.
c19291	And I will provide grass in the fields for your livestock,
c19292	and you will eat
c19293	and be satisfied.
c19294	But be careful
c19295	that you are not enticed
c19296	to turn aside
c19297	to worship ... to other gods,
c19298	and bow down
c19299	or the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you.
c19300	He will shut the heavens
c19301	so that there will be no rain,
c19302	nor will the land yield its produce,
c19303	and you will soon perish from the good land
c19304	the LORD is giving you.
c19305	Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds, ... on
c19306	tie them as a sign ... your hands
c19307	and bind them on your foreheads.
c19308	Teach them to your children,
c19309	speaking about them
c19310	when you sit at home
c19311	and when you walk along the road,
c19312	when you lie down
c19313	and when you get up.
c19314	Write them on the doorposts of your houses and gates,
c19315	so that ... your days [and those] of your children may be multiplied in the land
c19316	the LORD swore ... your fathers.
c19317	to give
c19318	as long as the heavens are above the earth,
c19319	For if you carefully observe all these commandments
c19320	I am giving
c19321	you to follow—
c19322	to love the LORD your God,
c19323	to walk in all His ways,
c19324	and to hold fast to Him—
c19325	then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you,
c19326	and you will dispossess nations
c19327	greater and stronger [than you].
c19328	Every place
c19329	where the sole of your foot treads
c19330	will be yours.
c19331	Your territory will extend from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Western Sea.
c19332	No man will be able to stand against you;
c19333	the LORD your God will put fear and dread of you upon all the land,
c19334	wherever you set foot,
c19335	as He has promised you.
c19336	See,
c19337	today I am setting before you a blessing and a curse:
c19338	There will be blessing
c19339	if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God
c19340	that I am giving you today,
c19341	but a curse
c19342	if you do not obey the commandments of the LORD your God
c19343	and turn aside from the path
c19344	I command you today
c19345	by following other gods,
c19346	which you have not known.
c19348	When the LORD your God brings you into the land
c19349	you are entering
c19350	to possess,
c19351	you are to proclaim the blessing on Mount Gerizim
c19352	and the curse on Mount Ebal.
c19353	Are not these mountains across the Jordan, west of the road toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites
c19354	who live in the Arabah opposite Gilgal, near the oak of Moreh?
c19355	For you are about to cross the Jordan
c19356	to enter
c19357	and possess the land
c19358	the LORD your God is giving you.
c19359	When you possess
c19360	and settle it,
c19361	be careful
c19362	to follow all the statutes and ordinances
c19363	that I am setting before you today.
c19364	These [are] the statutes and ordinances
c19365	you must be careful ... that
c19366	to follow ... in the land
c19367	the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given
c19368	you to possess.
c19369	all the days
c19370	you live
c19371	Destroy completely all the places
c19372	where the nations ... have served
c19373	you are dispossessing
c19374	their gods— atop the high mountains, on the hills, and under every green tree.
c19375	Tear down their altars,
c19376	smash their sacred pillars,
c19377	burn up their Asherah poles,
c19378	cut down the idols of their gods,
c19379	and wipe out their names from every place.
c19380	You shall not worship the LORD your God in this way.
c19381	Instead, ... the place
c19382	the LORD your God will choose from among all your tribes
c19383	to establish ... for His Name,
c19384	as a dwelling
c19385	you must seek
c19386	and there you must go.
c19387	To that place you are to bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and heave offerings, your vow offerings and freewill offerings, as well as the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
c19388	There, in the presence of the LORD your God, ... shall eat
c19389	[you and] your households ... and rejoice in all you do,
c19390	because the LORD your God has blessed you.
c19391	You are not to do as
c19392	we are doing here today,
c19393	[where] everyone [does] what
c19394	seems right in his own eyes.
c19395	For you have not yet come to the resting place and the inheritance
c19396	the LORD your God is giving you.
c19397	When you cross the Jordan
c19398	and live in the land
c19399	the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance,
c19400	and He gives you rest from all the enemies around you
c19401	and you live in security,
c19404	then the LORD your God will choose
c19405	a dwelling for His Name. And there
c19406	you are to bring everything
c19407	I command you:
c19408	your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice offerings
c19409	you vow to the LORD.
c19410	And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God— you, your sons and daughters, and your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite
c19411	within your gates,
c19412	since he has no portion or inheritance among you.
c19413	Be careful
c19414	not to offer your burnt offerings in just any place
c19415	you see;
c19416	only in the place
c19417	the LORD will choose in one of your tribal territories,
c19418	you must offer [them] ... and there
c19419	you shall do all
c19420	that I command you.
c19421	But whenever you wish, you may slaughter
c19422	and eat meat ... according to the blessing the LORD your God
c19423	within any of your gates, ... has given you.
c19424	Those who are clean or unclean may eat it, as they would a gazelle or deer,
c19425	but you must not eat the blood;
c19426	pour it on the ground like water.
c19427	you must not
c19428	Within your gates ... eat the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil, the firstborn of your herds or flocks, any of the offerings
c19429	that you have vowed to give,
c19430	or your freewill offerings or special gifts.
c19431	Instead, you must eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place
c19432	the LORD your God will choose—
c19433	you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite
c19434	within your gates.
c19435	Rejoice before the LORD your God in all you do,
c19436	and be careful
c19437	not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.
c19438	When the LORD your God expands your territory
c19439	as He has promised,
c19440	and say,
c19441	“I want to eat meat,”
c19442	and you crave
c19443	meat
c19444	you may eat it whenever you want.
c19445	If the place ... is too far
c19446	where the LORD your God chooses
c19447	to put His Name
c19448	from you, you may slaughter any of the herd or flock
c19449	He has given you, as
c19450	I have commanded you,
c19451	and you may eat it within your gates whenever you want.
c19452	Indeed, you may eat it as ... a gazelle or deer;
c19453	you would eat
c19454	both the clean and the unclean may eat it.
c19455	Only be sure
c19456	not to eat the blood,
c19457	because the blood
c19458	is the life,
c19459	and you must not eat the life with the meat.
c19460	You must not eat [the blood];
c19461	pour it on the ground like water.
c19462	Do not eat it,
c19463	so that it may go well with you and your children after you,
c19464	because you will be doing
c19465	what is right in the eyes of the LORD.
c19466	But ... your holy things
c19468	you are to take ... and your vow offerings
c19469	and go to the place
c19470	the LORD will choose.
c19471	Present the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God.
c19472	The blood of your other sacrifices must be poured out beside the altar of the LORD your God,
c19473	but you may eat the meat.
c19474	Be careful
c19475	to obey all these things
c19476	I command you,
c19477	so that it may always go well with you and your children after you,
c19478	because you will be doing
c19479	what is good
c19480	and right in the eyes of the LORD your God.
c19481	When the LORD your God cuts off ... the nations
c19482	you are entering
c19483	to dispossess,
c19484	before you
c19485	and you drive them out
c19486	and live in their land,
c19487	be careful
c19488	not to be ensnared by their ways
c19489	after they have been destroyed before you.
c19490	Do not inquire about their gods,
c19491	asking,
c19492	“How do these nations serve their gods?
c19493	I will do likewise.”
c19494	You must not [worship] the LORD your God in this way,
c19495	because ... every abomination ... the LORD
c19496	which ... hates.
c19497	they practice for their gods
c19498	They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire [as sacrifices] to their gods.
c19499	everything
c19500	I command you;
c19501	See that you do
c19503	do not add to it
c19504	or subtract from it.
c19505	If a prophet or dreamer of dreams arises among you
c19506	and proclaims a sign or wonder to you,
c19507	and if the sign or wonder ... comes about,
c19508	he has spoken to you
c19509	but he says,
c19510	“Let us follow other gods
c19511	(which you have not known)
c19512	and let us worship them,”
c19513	you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer.
c19514	For the LORD your God is testing you
c19515	to find out
c19516	whether you love [Him] with all your heart and with all your soul.
c19517	You are to follow the LORD your God
c19518	and fear Him.
c19519	Keep His commandments
c19520	and listen to His voice;
c19521	serve Him
c19522	and hold Him fast.
c19523	Such a prophet or dreamer must be put to death,
c19524	because he has advocated rebellion against the LORD your God,
c19525	who brought you out of the land of Egypt
c19526	and redeemed you from the house of slavery,
c19527	in order to turn you from the way
c19528	the LORD your God has commanded you
c19529	to walk.
c19530	So you must purge the evil from among you.
c19531	If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or your closest friend ... entices you,
c19532	(which
c19533	secretly
c19534	saying,
c19535	“Let us go
c19536	and worship other gods”
c19537	neither you nor your fathers have known,
c19538	the gods of the peoples
c19539	around you,
c19540	whether near
c19541	or far, from one end of the earth to the other),
c19542	you must not yield to him
c19543	or listen to him. Show him no
c19544	pity, and do not
c19545	spare
c19546	him or shield him.
c19547	Instead, you must surely kill him.
c19548	Your hand must be the first against him
c19549	to put him to death,
c19550	and then the hands of all the people.
c19551	Stone him
c19552	to death
c19553	for trying
c19554	to turn you away from the LORD your God,
c19555	who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
c19556	Then all Israel will hear
c19557	and be afraid,
c19558	and will never again
c19559	do such a wicked thing among you.
c19560	If, regarding one of the cities ... you hear
c19561	the LORD your God is giving you
c19562	to inhabit,
c19563	it said
c19564	that wicked men have arisen from among you
c19565	and led the people of their city astray,
c19566	saying,
c19567	“Let us go
c19568	and serve other gods”
c19569	(which you have not known),
c19570	then you must inquire,
c19571	investigate,
c19572	and interrogate thoroughly.
c19573	And if it is established with certainty
c19575	that this abomination has been committed among you,
c19576	you must surely strike down the inhabitants of that city with the sword.
c19577	Destroy ... all [its people]
c19579	with the sword ... and livestock.
c19580	And you are to gather all its plunder in the middle of the public square,
c19581	and completely burn the city and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God.
c19582	[The city] must remain a mound of ruins forever,
c19583	never to be rebuilt.
c19584	Nothing set apart for destruction shall be found in your hands,
c19585	so that the LORD will turn from His fierce anger,
c19586	grant you mercy,
c19587	show you compassion,
c19588	and multiply you
c19589	as He swore to your fathers,
c19590	because you obey the LORD your God,
c19591	keeping all His commandments
c19592	I am giving you today,
c19593	doing
c19594	what is right in the eyes of the LORD your God.
c19595	You are sons of the LORD your God;
c19596	do not cut
c19597	yourselves or shave your forehead on behalf of the dead,
c19598	for you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God.
c19599	The LORD has chosen
c19600	you to be His prized possession ... the peoples
c19601	out of all
c19602	on the face of the earth.
c19603	You must not eat any detestable thing.
c19604	These are the animals
c19605	that you may eat:
c19606	The ox, the sheep, the goat,
c19607	the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain sheep.
c19608	any animal
c19609	that has hooves
c19610	divided in two
c19611	and that chews the cud.
c19612	You may eat
c19613	But of those that chew the cud or have divided hooves, you are not to eat
c19614	the camel, the rabbit, [or] the rock badger.
c19615	Although they chew the cud,
c19616	they do not have hooves.
c19617	They are unclean for you,
c19618	as well as the pig;
c19619	though its hooves are divided,
c19620	it does not chew the cud.
c19621	It is unclean for you.
c19622	You must not eat its meat
c19623	or touch its carcass.
c19624	Of all ... you may eat
c19625	[the creatures] in the water,
c19626	anything
c19627	with fins and scales,
c19629	anything
c19630	that does not have fins and scales;
c19631	but you may not eat
c19632	it is unclean for you.
c19633	You may eat any clean bird,
c19634	but these
c19635	you may not eat:
c19636	the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,
c19637	the red kite, the black kite, any kind of falcon,
c19638	any kind of raven,
c19639	the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, any kind of hawk,
c19640	the little owl, the great owl, the white owl,
c19641	the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant,
c19642	the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, or the bat.
c19643	All winged insects that swarm
c19644	are unclean for you;
c19645	they may not be eaten.
c19646	But you may eat any clean bird.
c19647	You are not to eat any carcass;
c19648	it to a temporary resident
c19649	within your gates,
c19650	you may give
c19651	and he may eat it,
c19652	or you may sell it to a foreigner.
c19653	For you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God.
c19654	You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
c19655	You must be sure to set aside a tenth of all the produce
c19656	brought forth each year from your fields.
c19657	And you are to eat ... in the presence of the LORD your God at the place
c19658	where He will choose
c19659	as a dwelling for His Name,
c19660	a tenth of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks,
c19661	so that you may learn
c19662	to fear the LORD your God always.
c19663	But if the distance is too great for
c19664	because
c19665	you to carry
c19666	that with which ... the place ... is too far away,
c19667	where the LORD your God will choose
c19668	to put His Name
c19669	the LORD your God has blessed you,
c19670	then exchange it for money,
c19671	take the money in your hand,
c19672	and go to the place
c19673	where the LORD your God will choose.
c19674	Then you may spend the money on anything
c19675	you desire:
c19676	cattle, sheep, wine, strong drink, or anything
c19677	you wish.
c19678	You are to feast there in the presence of the LORD your God
c19679	and rejoice with your household.
c19680	the Levite
c19681	within your gates,
c19682	And do not neglect
c19683	since he has no portion or inheritance among you.
c19684	At the end of every three years, bring a tenth of all your produce for that year
c19685	and lay [it] up within your gates.
c19686	Then the Levite ... may come
c19687	(because he has no portion or inheritance among you),
c19688	the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow
c19689	within your gates
c19690	and eat
c19691	and be satisfied.
c19692	And the LORD your God will bless you in all the work of your hands.
c19694	At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.
c19695	This is the manner of remission:
c19696	Every creditor shall cancel
c19697	what he has loaned his neighbor.
c19698	He is not to collect anything from his neighbor or brother,
c19699	because the LORD’s time of release has been proclaimed.
c19700	You may collect something from a foreigner,
c19702	whatever your brother owes you.
c19703	but you must forgive
c19704	There will be no poor among you, however,
c19705	because the LORD will surely bless you in the land
c19706	the LORD your God is giving you ... as an inheritance,
c19707	to possess
c19708	only
c19709	if ... you obey the LORD your God
c19710	and are careful
c19711	to follow all these commandments
c19712	I am giving you today.
c19713	When the LORD your God blesses you
c19714	as He has promised,
c19715	you will lend to many nations
c19716	but borrow from none;
c19717	you will rule over many nations,
c19718	but be ruled by none.
c19719	If there is a poor man among your brothers within any of the gates in the land
c19720	that the LORD your God is giving you,
c19721	you are not to harden your heart
c19722	[or] shut your hand from your poor brother.
c19723	Instead, you are to open your hand to him
c19724	and freely loan him whatever he needs.
c19726	Be careful
c19727	not to harbor this wicked thought in your heart,
c19729	“The seventh year, the year of release, is near,”
c19730	so that you look upon your poor brother begrudgingly
c19731	and give him nothing.
c19732	He will cry out to the LORD against you,
c19733	and you will be guilty of sin.
c19734	Give generously to him,
c19735	and do not let your heart be grieved
c19736	[when you do so]
c19737	And because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything to which you put your hand.
c19738	For there will never cease to be poor in the land;
c19739	that is why I am commanding you
c19740	to
c19741	open wide your hand to your brother and to the poor and needy in your land.
c19742	If a fellow Hebrew, a man or a woman, sells himself to you
c19743	and serves you six years,
c19744	in the seventh year you must set him free.
c19746	And when you release him,
c19747	do not send him away empty-handed.
c19748	You are to furnish him liberally from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress.
c19749	as the LORD your God has blessed you.
c19750	You shall give to him
c19751	Remember
c19752	that you were slaves in the land of Egypt,
c19753	and the LORD your God redeemed you;
c19754	that is why I am giving you this command today.
c19756	But if your servant says to you,
c19757	‘I do not want to leave you,’ ... with you,
c19758	because he loves
c19759	you and your household
c19760	and is well off
c19761	take an awl
c19762	and pierce [it] through his ear into the door,
c19763	and he will become your servant for life.
c19764	And treat your maidservant the same way.
c19765	Do not regard it as a hardship
c19766	to set [your servant] free,
c19767	because his six years of service were worth twice the wages of a hired hand.
c19768	And the LORD your God will bless you in all
c19769	you do.
c19770	every firstborn
c19771	produced by your herds and flocks.
c19772	You must set apart to the LORD your God ... male
c19773	You are not to put the firstborn of your oxen to work
c19774	[or] shear the firstborn of your flock.
c19775	Each year ... are to eat it before the LORD your God in the place
c19776	the LORD will choose.
c19777	you and your household
c19778	But if [an animal] has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw,
c19779	you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.
c19780	Eat it within your gates;
c19781	both the unclean person and the clean [may eat it] as if it were a gazelle or deer.
c19782	But you must not eat the blood;
c19783	pour it on the ground like water.
c19784	Observe the month of Abib
c19785	and celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God,
c19786	because in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night.
c19787	You are to offer to the LORD your God the Passover sacrifice from the herd or flock in the place
c19788	where the LORD will choose
c19789	as a dwelling for His Name.
c19790	You must not eat leavened bread with it;
c19791	for seven days you are to eat with it unleavened bread, the bread of affliction,
c19792	because you left the land of Egypt in haste—
c19793	so that you may remember
c19794	you left the land of Egypt.
c19795	for the rest of your life the day
c19796	No yeast is to be found in all your land for seven days,
c19797	and none of the meat ... shall remain
c19798	you sacrifice in the evening of the first day
c19799	until morning.
c19800	You are not
c19801	to sacrifice the Passover animal in any of the towns
c19802	the LORD your God is giving you.
c19803	You must only ... at the place
c19804	where the LORD your God will choose
c19805	as a dwelling for His Name.
c19806	offer the Passover sacrifice ... Do this in the evening
c19807	as the sun sets,
c19808	at the same time
c19809	you departed from Egypt.
c19810	And you shall roast
c19811	and eat it in the place
c19812	the LORD your God will choose,
c19813	and in the morning
c19814	you shall return to your tents.
c19815	For six days you must eat unleavened bread,
c19816	and on the seventh day you shall hold a solemn assembly to the LORD your God,
c19817	and you must not do any work.
c19818	You are to count off seven weeks
c19819	you first put the sickle to the standing grain.
c19821	[from] [the time]
c19822	And you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God with a freewill offering
c19823	that you give
c19824	in proportion to how the LORD your God has blessed you,
c19825	and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God ... you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite
c19826	where ... within your gates,
c19827	as well as the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widows
c19828	among you.
c19829	in the place
c19830	He will choose
c19831	as a dwelling for His Name—
c19832	Remember
c19833	that you were slaves in Egypt,
c19834	and carefully
c19835	follow these statutes.
c19836	You are to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days
c19837	after you have gathered [the produce of] your threshing floor and your winepress.
c19838	And you shall rejoice in your feast— you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite, as well as the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widows
c19839	among you.
c19840	For seven days you shall celebrate a feast for the LORD your God in the place
c19841	He will choose,
c19842	because the LORD your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands,
c19843	so that your joy will be complete.
c19844	Three times a year all your men are to appear before the LORD your God in the place
c19845	He will choose:
c19846	at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles
c19847	No one should appear before the LORD empty-handed.
c19848	Everyone must appear with a gift as he is able, according to the blessing the LORD your God
c19849	has given you.
c19850	You are to appoint judges and officials ... in every town
c19851	for your tribes ... the LORD your God is giving you.
c19852	They are to judge the people with righteous judgment.
c19853	Do not deny justice
c19854	or show partiality. Do not
c19855	accept any bribes,
c19856	for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise
c19857	and twists the words of the righteous.
c19858	Pursue justice, and justice alone,
c19859	so that you may live,
c19860	and you may possess the land
c19861	the LORD your God is giving you.
c19862	You shall not plant any kind of tree as an Asherah pole next to the altar ... for the LORD your God,
c19863	you will build
c19864	and do not set up for yourselves a sacred pillar,
c19865	which the LORD your God hates.
c19866	You shall not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep
c19867	with any defect [or] serious flaw,
c19868	for that is detestable to the LORD your God.
c19869	If ... among you in one of the towns ... is found
c19870	that the LORD your God gives you
c19871	a man or woman
c19872	doing
c19873	evil in the sight of the LORD your God
c19874	by transgressing His covenant
c19875	and going
c19876	to worship other gods,
c19877	bowing down to them or to the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven—
c19878	which I have forbidden—
c19879	and if it is reported
c19880	and you hear about it,
c19881	you must investigate it thoroughly.
c19882	If ... true
c19883	the report
c19884	is ... and such an abomination has happened in Israel,
c19885	you must bring out ... that man or woman
c19886	who has done this evil thing,
c19887	to your gates
c19889	and stone that person
c19890	to death.
c19891	On the testimony of two or three witnesses a man shall be put to death, ... witness.
c19892	but he shall not be executed on the testimony of a lone
c19893	The hands of the witnesses shall be the first
c19894	in putting him to death,
c19895	and after that, the hands of all the people.
c19896	You must purge the evil from among you.
c19897	If a case is too difficult for you to judge, ... is regarding bloodshed, lawsuits, or assaults,
c19898	whether the controversy within your gates
c19900	you must go up to the place
c19901	the LORD your God will choose.
c19902	You are to go to the Levitical priests and to the judge
c19903	who presides at that time.
c19904	Inquire of them,
c19905	and they will give you a verdict in the case.
c19906	You must abide by the verdict
c19907	they give you at the place
c19908	the LORD will choose.
c19909	Be careful
c19910	to do everything
c19911	they instruct you,
c19912	according to the terms of law
c19913	they give
c19914	and the verdict
c19915	they proclaim.
c19917	Do not turn aside ... from the decision
c19918	they declare to you.
c19919	to the right or to the left
c19920	But the man
c19921	who acts presumptuously,
c19922	refusing to listen either to the priest
c19923	who stands
c19924	there to serve the LORD your God,
c19925	or to the judge,
c19926	must be put to death.
c19927	You must purge the evil from Israel.
c19928	Then all the people will hear
c19929	and be afraid,
c19930	and will no longer behave arrogantly.
c19931	When you enter the land
c19932	the LORD your God is giving you
c19933	and have taken possession of it
c19934	and settled it,
c19935	and you say,
c19936	“Let us set a king over us like all the nations
c19937	around us,”
c19938	you are to appoint over yourselves the king ... Appoint
c19939	the LORD your God shall choose. ... who
c19940	a king from among your brothers; ... over yourselves,
c19941	you are not
c19942	to set a foreigner
c19943	or one ... is not of your brothers.
c19944	But [the king] must not acquire many horses for himself
c19945	or send the people back to Egypt ... ‘You are never
c19946	to acquire more horses,
c19947	for the LORD has told you,
c19949	to go back that way again.’
c19950	He must not take many wives for himself,
c19951	lest his heart go astray.
c19952	He must not accumulate for himself great amounts of silver and gold.
c19954	When he is seated on his royal throne,
c19955	he must write for himself a copy of this instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.
c19956	It is to remain with him,
c19957	and he is to read from it all the days of his life,
c19958	so that he may learn
c19959	to fear the LORD his God
c19960	by carefully observing all the words of this instruction and these statutes.
c19962	Then his heart will not be exalted above his countrymen,
c19963	and he will not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or to the left,
c19964	in order that he and his sons may reign many years over his kingdom in Israel.
c19965	The Levitical priests— indeed the whole tribe of Levi— shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel.
c19966	They are to eat the offerings made by fire to the LORD; that is their inheritance.
c19967	Although they have no inheritance among their brothers,
c19968	the LORD
c19969	[is] their inheritance,
c19970	as He promised them.
c19971	This shall be the priests’ share from the people who offer a sacrifice,
c19972	whether a bull
c19973	or a sheep:
c19974	the priests are to be given the shoulder, jowls, and the stomach.
c19975	You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the first wool sheared from your flock.
c19976	For the LORD your God has chosen ... out of all your tribes
c19977	to stand
c19978	and minister in His name
c19979	[Levi] and his sons ... for all time.
c19980	Now if a Levite moves from any town ... Israel
c19981	of residence throughout
c19982	and comes in all earnestness to the place
c19983	the LORD will choose,
c19984	then he shall serve in the name of the LORD his God like all his fellow Levites
c19985	who stand there before the LORD.
c19986	They shall eat equal portions, even though he has received [money] from the sale of his father’s estate.
c19987	When you enter the land
c19988	the LORD your God is giving you,
c19989	do not
c19990	imitate the detestable ways of the nations there.
c19991	Let no one be found among you
c19992	who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire,
c19993	practices divination
c19994	[or] conjury, interprets omens, practices sorcery,
c19995	casts spells,
c19996	consults a medium or familiar spirit,
c19997	or inquires of the dead.
c19998	For whoever ... is detestable to the LORD,
c19999	does these things
c20000	and because of these detestable things the LORD your God is driving out [the nations] before you.
c20001	You must be blameless before the LORD your God.
c20002	Though these nations
c20003	you shall dispossess
c20004	listen to conjurers and diviners,
c20006	the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so.
c20007	The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers.
c20008	You must listen to him.
c20009	This is what
c20010	you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly,
c20011	when you said,
c20012	“Let us not
c20013	hear the voice of the LORD our God
c20014	or see this great fire anymore, so that we will not
c20015	die!”
c20016	Then the LORD said to me,
c20017	well.
c20018	“They have spoken
c20019	I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers.
c20020	I will put My words in his mouth,
c20021	and he will tell them everything
c20022	I command him.
c20024	anyone
c20025	who does not listen to My words
c20026	that [that prophet] speaks in My name.
c20027	And I will hold accountable
c20028	But if any prophet
c20029	dares
c20030	to speak a message in My name
c20031	that I have not commanded
c20032	him to speak,
c20033	[or] to speak in the name of other gods,
c20034	that prophet must be put to death.”
c20035	You may ask in your heart,
c20036	“How can we recognize a message
c20037	that the LORD has not spoken?”
c20038	When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD
c20039	and the message does not come to pass
c20040	or come true, ... has not
c20041	that is a message
c20042	the LORD ... spoken. ... Do not
c20043	The prophet has spoken presumptuously.
c20044	be afraid of him.
c20045	When the LORD your God has cut off the nations
c20046	whose land He is giving you,
c20047	so that you drive them out
c20048	and settle in their cities and houses,
c20049	then you are to set apart for yourselves three cities within the land
c20050	that the LORD your God is giving
c20051	you to possess.
c20052	You are to build roads for yourselves
c20053	and divide into three regions the land
c20054	which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance,
c20056	so that any manslayer can flee to these cities.
c20057	Now this is the situation regarding the manslayer
c20058	who flees [to one of these cities]
c20059	to save his life,
c20060	having killed his neighbor accidentally,
c20061	without intending to harm him:
c20062	If he goes into the forest with his neighbor
c20063	to cut timber
c20064	and swings his ax
c20065	to chop down a tree,
c20066	but the blade flies off the handle
c20067	and strikes ... his neighbor,
c20068	and kills
c20069	he may flee to one of these cities
c20070	to save his life.
c20071	Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the manslayer
c20072	in a rage,
c20073	overtake him
c20074	since the distance is great, ... since
c20075	and strike him dead
c20076	though he did not deserve to die,
c20077	he did not intend any harm.
c20078	This is why I am commanding
c20080	you to set apart three cities for yourselves.
c20081	And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory,
c20082	as He swore to your fathers,
c20083	and gives you all the land
c20084	He promised
c20085	them,
c20086	and if you carefully observe all these commandments
c20088	I am giving you today,
c20089	loving the LORD your God
c20090	and walking in His ways at all times,
c20091	then you are to add three more cities to these three.
c20092	Thus innocent blood will not be shed in the land
c20093	the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance,
c20094	so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed.
c20095	If, however, a man
c20096	hates his neighbor
c20097	and lies in wait,
c20098	attacks him
c20099	and kills him,
c20101	and then flees to one of these cities,
c20102	the elders of his city must send for him,
c20103	bring him back,
c20104	and hand him over to the avenger of blood
c20105	to die.
c20106	You must show him no pity.
c20107	You are to purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood,
c20108	that it may go well with you.
c20109	You must not move your neighbor’s boundary marker,
c20110	which was set up by your ancestors [to mark] the inheritance
c20111	you shall receive in the land
c20112	the LORD your God is giving
c20113	you to possess.
c20114	A lone witness is not sufficient to establish any wrongdoing [or] sin against a man,
c20115	regardless of what offense
c20116	he may have committed.
c20117	A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
c20118	If a false witness ... against someone,
c20119	testifies ... accusing him of a crime,
c20120	both parties ... must stand
c20121	to the dispute ... [in office]
c20122	in the presence of the LORD, before the priests and judges
c20123	who are ... at that time.
c20124	The judges shall investigate thoroughly,
c20125	and if the witness is proven to be a liar
c20126	who has falsely accused his brother,
c20127	you must do
c20128	to him as he intended
c20129	to do to his brother.
c20130	You must purge the evil from among you.
c20131	Then the rest [of the people] will hear
c20132	and be afraid,
c20133	and they will never again
c20134	do anything so evil among you.
c20135	You must show no pity:
c20136	life for life,
c20137	eye for eye,
c20138	tooth for tooth,
c20139	hand for hand,
c20140	[and] foot for foot.
c20141	When you go out to war against your enemies
c20142	and see horses, chariots, and an army
c20143	larger than yours,
c20144	do not be afraid of them;
c20145	for the LORD your God, ... is with you.
c20146	who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
c20147	When you are about to
c20148	go into battle,
c20149	the priest is to come forward
c20150	and address the army,
c20151	saying to them,
c20152	“Hear,
c20153	O Israel,
c20154	today you are going into battle with your enemies.
c20155	Do not be fainthearted
c20156	[or] be afraid;
c20157	do not be alarmed
c20158	or terrified because of them.
c20159	For the LORD your God
c20160	[is] He who goes with you
c20161	to fight for you against your enemies,
c20162	to give you the victory.”
c20163	Furthermore, the officers are to address the army,
c20164	saying,
c20165	“Has any man
c20166	built a new house
c20167	and not dedicated it?
c20168	Let him return
c20169	home,
c20170	or he may die in battle
c20171	and another man dedicate it.
c20172	Has any man
c20173	planted a vineyard
c20174	and not begun to enjoy its fruit?
c20175	Let him return
c20176	home,
c20177	or he may die in battle
c20178	and another man enjoy its fruit.
c20179	Has any man
c20180	become pledged to a woman
c20181	and not married her?
c20182	Let him return
c20183	home,
c20184	or he may die in battle
c20185	and another man marry her.”
c20186	Then the officers ... further
c20187	shall speak ... to the army,
c20188	saying,
c20189	“Is any man afraid or fainthearted?
c20190	Let him return
c20191	home,
c20192	so that the hearts of his brothers will not melt like his own.”
c20194	When the officers have finished
c20195	addressing the army,
c20196	they are to appoint commanders to lead it.
c20197	When you approach a city
c20198	to fight against it,
c20199	you are to make an offer of peace.
c20200	will become
c20201	If they accept your offer of peace
c20202	and open [their gates],
c20204	all the people
c20205	[there]
c20206	forced laborers
c20207	to serve you.
c20208	But if they refuse to make peace with you
c20209	and wage war against you,
c20210	lay siege to [that city].
c20211	When the LORD your God has delivered it into your hands,
c20212	you must strike down every male with the sword.
c20213	But the women, children, livestock, and whatever
c20214	else is in the city—
c20215	all its spoil— you may take as plunder,
c20216	and you shall use the spoil of your enemies
c20217	that the LORD your God gives you.
c20218	This is how you are to treat all the cities
c20219	that are far away from you
c20220	and do not belong to the nations nearby.
c20221	However, in the cities of the nations
c20222	that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance,
c20223	you must not leave alive anything that breathes.
c20224	You must completely destroy them— the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites—
c20225	as the LORD your God has commanded you,
c20226	so that they cannot teach
c20227	you to do all the detestable things
c20228	they do for their gods
c20229	[and] cause you to sin against the LORD your God.
c20230	When you lay siege to a city for an extended time
c20231	while fighting against it
c20232	to capture it,
c20233	you must not destroy its trees
c20234	by putting an ax to them,
c20235	because you can eat their fruit
c20236	.You must not cut them down.
c20237	Are the trees of the field human,
c20238	that you should besiege them?
c20239	But ... the trees
c20240	that you know
c20241	do not produce fruit.
c20242	you may destroy
c20243	[Use them]
c20244	to build siege works against the city
c20245	that is waging war against you,
c20246	until it falls.
c20247	If [one] is found slain, ... in the land
c20248	the LORD your God is giving you
c20249	to possess,
c20250	lying in a field
c20251	and it is not known
c20252	who killed him,
c20253	your elders and judges must come out
c20254	and measure the distance ... to ... cities.
c20255	from the victim ... the neighboring
c20256	Then
c20257	of the city
c20258	nearest the victim
c20259	the elders ... shall take a heifer
c20260	that has never ... or used for work,
c20261	been yoked
c20262	bring the heifer to a valley with running water
c20263	that has not been plowed
c20264	or sown,
c20265	and break its neck there by the stream.
c20266	And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward,
c20267	for the LORD your God has chosen
c20268	them to serve
c20269	Him and pronounce blessings in His name
c20270	and to give a ruling in every dispute and case of assault.
c20271	Then all the elders of the city
c20272	nearest the victim
c20273	shall wash their hands ... over the heifer
c20274	by the stream ... whose neck has been broken,
c20275	and they shall declare,
c20277	“Our hands did not shed this blood,
c20278	nor did our eyes see it.
c20279	Accept this atonement, ... for Your people Israel
c20280	whom You have redeemed,
c20281	O LORD,
c20282	and do not hold the shedding of innocent blood against them.”
c20283	And the bloodshed will be atoned for.
c20284	So you shall purge from among you the guilt of shedding innocent blood,
c20285	since you have done
c20286	what is right in the eyes of the LORD.
c20287	When you go to war against your enemies
c20288	and the LORD your God delivers them into your hands
c20289	and you take them captive,
c20290	if you see a beautiful woman among [them],
c20291	and you desire her
c20292	and want to take her as your wife,
c20293	then you shall bring her into your house.
c20294	She must shave her head,
c20295	trim her nails,
c20296	and put aside the clothes of her captivity.
c20297	she has lived in your house
c20298	a full month and mourned her father and mother,
c20299	After ... you may have relations with her
c20300	and be her husband,
c20301	and she shall be your wife.
c20302	And
c20303	if you are not pleased with her,
c20304	you are to let her go wherever she wishes.
c20305	But you must not sell her for money
c20306	or treat her as a slave,
c20307	since you have dishonored her.
c20308	If a man has two wives,
c20309	one beloved
c20310	and the other unloved,
c20311	and [both] bear him sons,
c20312	but the unloved wife has the firstborn son,
c20314	when
c20315	assigns his inheritance to his sons
c20316	that man
c20317	he must not [appoint]
c20318	the son of the beloved wife as the firstborn over [the son] of the unloved wife.
c20319	Instead, he must acknowledge the firstborn, the son of his unloved wife,
c20320	by giving him a double portion of all
c20321	that he has.
c20322	For [that son] is the firstfruits of his [father’s] strength;
c20323	the right of the firstborn belongs to him.
c20324	If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son
c20325	who does not obey his father and mother,
c20326	when disciplined,
c20327	[or] listen to them
c20328	his father and mother are to lay hold of him
c20329	and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown,
c20330	and say to the elders,
c20331	“This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious;
c20332	he does not obey us.
c20333	He is a glutton and a drunkard.”
c20334	Then all the men of his city will stone
c20335	him to death.
c20336	You must purge the evil from among you,
c20337	and all Israel will hear
c20338	and be afraid.
c20339	If a man has committed a sin worthy of death,
c20340	and he is executed,
c20341	and you hang his body on a tree,
c20342	you must not leave the body on the tree overnight,
c20343	but you must be sure to bury him that day,
c20344	because anyone who is hung on a tree is under God’s curse.
c20345	You must not defile the land
c20346	the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
c20347	If you see your brother’s ox or sheep ... you must not
c20348	straying,
c20349	ignore it;
c20350	be sure to return it to your brother.
c20351	If your brother does not live near you, ... the animal
c20352	or if you do not know who he is,
c20353	you are to take ... home
c20354	to remain with you
c20355	until your brother comes seeking it;
c20356	then you can return it to him.
c20357	And you shall do the same for his donkey,
c20358	his cloak,
c20359	or anything your brother has lost
c20361	and you have found.
c20362	You must not
c20363	ignore it.
c20364	If you see your brother’s donkey or ox ... you must not
c20365	fallen on the road,
c20366	ignore it;
c20367	you must help him lift it up.
c20368	A woman must not wear men’s clothing,
c20369	and a man must not wear women’s clothing,
c20370	for whoever ... is detestable to the LORD your God.
c20371	does these things
c20372	If you come across a bird’s nest with chicks or eggs, either in a tree or on the ground along the road,
c20373	and the mother is sitting on the chicks or eggs, ... along with
c20374	you must not take the mother ... the young.
c20375	but be sure to let the mother go,
c20376	You may take the young,
c20377	so that it may be well with you
c20378	and that you may prolong your days.
c20379	If you build a new house,
c20380	you are to construct a railing around your roof,
c20381	so that you do not bring bloodguilt on your house
c20382	if someone
c20383	falls from it.
c20384	Do not plant your vineyard with two types of seed,
c20385	or the entire harvest will be defiled—
c20386	both the crop
c20387	you plant
c20388	and the fruit of your vineyard.
c20389	Do not plow with an ox and a donkey [yoked] together.
c20390	Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
c20391	You are to make tassels on the four corners of the cloak
c20392	you wear.
c20393	Suppose a man marries a woman,
c20394	has relations with her,
c20395	and comes to hate her,
c20396	and then accuses her of shameful conduct
c20397	and gives her a bad name,
c20398	saying,
c20399	“I married this woman
c20400	and had relations with her,
c20401	but I discovered she was not a virgin.”
c20402	Then the young woman’s father and mother
c20403	shall bring the proof of her virginity to the city elders at the gate
c20404	[and] say to the elders,
c20405	“I gave my daughter in marriage to this man,
c20406	but he has come to hate her.
c20407	And now
c20408	he has accused her of shameful conduct,
c20409	saying,
c20410	‘I discovered your daughter was not a virgin.’
c20411	But here is the proof of [her] virginity.”
c20412	And they shall spread out the cloth before the city elders.
c20413	Then the elders of that city shall take the man
c20414	and punish him.
c20415	They are also to fine him a hundred [shekels] of silver
c20416	and give them to the young woman’s father,
c20417	because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name.
c20418	And she shall remain his wife;
c20419	he must not
c20420	divorce her as long as he lives.
c20421	If, however, this accusation is true,
c20422	and no proof of the young woman’s virginity is found,
c20423	[she] shall be brought to the door of her father’s house,
c20424	and there the men of her city will stone
c20425	her to death.
c20426	For she has committed an outrage in Israel
c20427	by being promiscuous in her father’s house.
c20428	You must purge the evil from among you.
c20429	If a man is found
c20430	lying with another man’s wife,
c20431	must die.
c20432	both the man
c20433	who slept with [her]
c20434	and the woman
c20435	You must purge the evil from Israel.
c20436	If there is a virgin
c20437	pledged in marriage to a man,
c20438	and another man encounters her in the city
c20439	and sleeps with her,
c20440	you must take both of them out to the gate of that city
c20441	and stone
c20442	them to death—
c20443	the young woman because
c20444	she did not cry out in the city,
c20445	and the man because
c20446	he has violated his neighbor’s wife.
c20447	You must purge the evil from among you.
c20448	But if the man encounters a betrothed woman in the open country,
c20449	and he overpowers her
c20450	and rapes her,
c20451	the man ... must die.
c20452	who [has done this]
c20453	only
c20454	Do nothing to the young woman,
c20455	she [has committed] no sin [worthy] of death.
c20456	because
c20457	is just like one in which a man attacks his neighbor
c20458	and murders him.
c20459	This case
c20460	When he found her in the field,
c20461	the betrothed woman cried out,
c20462	but there was no one to rescue her.
c20463	If a man encounters a virgin
c20464	who is not pledged in marriage,
c20465	and he overpowers her
c20466	and rapes her,
c20467	and they are discovered,
c20468	the man ... must pay
c20469	who raped her
c20470	the young woman’s father fifty [shekels] of silver,
c20471	and she must become his wife
c20472	because he has violated her.
c20473	He must not
c20474	divorce her as long as he lives.
c20475	A man is not to marry his father’s wife,
c20476	so that he will not dishonor his father’s marriage bed.
c20477	No man with crushed or severed genitals may enter the assembly of the LORD.
c20478	No one of illegitimate birth may enter the assembly of the LORD,
c20479	nor may any of his descendants, even to the tenth generation.
c20480	No Ammonite or Moabite ... may enter the assembly of the LORD,
c20481	or any of their descendants ... even to the tenth generation.
c20482	For they did not meet you with food and water on your way
c20483	out of Egypt,
c20484	[and] they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram-naharaim
c20485	to curse you.
c20486	Yet the LORD your God would not
c20487	listen to Balaam,
c20488	and the LORD turned the curse into a blessing for you, ... your God
c20489	because the LORD ... loves you.
c20490	You are not to seek peace or prosperity from them as long as you live.
c20491	Do not despise an Edomite,
c20492	for he is your brother.
c20493	Do not despise an Egyptian,
c20494	because you lived as a foreigner in his land.
c20495	of children
c20496	born to them
c20497	The third generation ... may enter the assembly of the LORD.
c20498	When you are encamped against your enemies,
c20499	then you shall keep yourself from every wicked thing.
c20500	If any man among you
c20501	becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission,
c20502	he must leave the camp ... outside.
c20503	[and] stay
c20505	When evening approaches,
c20506	he must wash with water,
c20508	and when the sun sets
c20509	he may return to the camp.
c20510	You must have a place outside the camp
c20511	to go [and] relieve yourself.
c20512	And you must have a digging tool in your equipment
c20513	so that
c20514	when you relieve yourself
c20515	you can dig a hole
c20517	and cover up your excrement.
c20518	For the LORD your God walks throughout your camp
c20519	to protect you
c20520	and deliver your enemies to you.
c20521	Your camp must be holy,
c20522	lest He see anything unclean among you
c20523	and turn away from you.
c20524	Do not return a slave to his master
c20525	if he has taken refuge with you.
c20526	Let him live among you wherever
c20527	he chooses, in the town
c20528	of his pleasing
c20529	Do not oppress him.
c20530	No daughter ... of Israel is to be
c20531	or son ... a cult prostitute.
c20532	You must not bring the wages of a prostitute, whether female or male, into the house of the LORD your God to fulfill any vow,
c20533	because both are detestable to the LORD your God.
c20534	Do not charge your brother interest on money, food, or any other
c20535	type of loan.
c20536	You may charge a foreigner interest,
c20537	but not your brother,
c20538	so that the LORD your God may bless you in everything to which you put your hand in the land
c20539	you are entering
c20540	to possess.
c20541	If you make a vow to the LORD your God,
c20542	do not be slow to keep it,
c20544	because He will surely require it of you,
c20545	and you will be guilty of sin.
c20546	But if you refrain
c20547	from making a vow,
c20548	you will not be guilty of sin.
c20549	Be careful ... on what comes from your lips,
c20550	to follow through
c20551	because you have freely vowed to the LORD your God
c20552	with your own mouth.
c20553	When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard,
c20554	you may eat your fill of grapes,
c20555	but you must not put any in your basket.
c20556	When you enter your neighbor’s grainfield,
c20557	you may pluck the heads of grain with your hand,
c20558	but you must not put a sickle to your neighbor’s grain.
c20559	If a man ... a woman,
c20560	marries
c20562	but she becomes displeasing
c20563	to him because he finds some indecency in her,
c20564	he may write her a certificate of divorce,
c20565	hand it to her,
c20566	and send her away from his house.
c20567	If, after leaving his house,
c20568	she goes
c20569	and becomes another man’s wife,
c20570	and the second man hates her,
c20571	writes her a certificate of divorce,
c20572	hands it to her,
c20573	and sends her away from his house,
c20574	or if he dies,
c20576	the husband ... first may not
c20577	who divorced her
c20578	her again
c20579	marry
c20581	after she has been defiled,
c20582	for that [is] an abomination to the LORD.
c20583	You must not bring sin upon the land
c20584	the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
c20585	If a man is newly married,
c20586	he must not be sent to war
c20587	or be pressed into any duty.
c20588	For one year he is free to stay at home
c20589	and bring joy to the wife
c20590	he has married.
c20591	Do not take a pair of millstones or even an upper millstone as security for a debt,
c20592	because that would be taking one’s livelihood as security.
c20593	If a man is caught
c20594	kidnapping one of his Israelite brothers,
c20595	whether he treats him as a slave
c20596	or sells him,
c20597	the kidnapper must die.
c20598	You must purge the evil from among you.
c20599	In cases of infectious skin diseases, be careful
c20600	to diligently
c20601	follow everything
c20602	the Levitical priests instruct you. ... as
c20603	I have commanded them.
c20604	Be careful
c20605	to do
c20606	Remember
c20607	what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the journey
c20608	after you had left Egypt.
c20609	When you lend anything to your neighbor,
c20610	do not enter his house
c20611	to collect security.
c20612	You are to stand outside
c20613	while the man
c20614	to whom you are lending
c20615	brings the security out to you.
c20616	If he is a poor man,
c20617	you must not go to sleep with the security {in your possession};
c20618	be sure to return [it] to him
c20619	by sunset,
c20620	so that he may sleep in his own cloak
c20621	and bless you,
c20622	and this will be credited to you as righteousness before the LORD your God.
c20623	Do not oppress a hired hand who is poor and needy, [whether] he is a brother or a foreigner residing
c20624	in one of your towns.
c20625	You are to pay his wages each day
c20626	before sunset,
c20627	because he is poor
c20628	and depends
c20629	on them. Otherwise he may cry out to the LORD against you,
c20630	and you will be guilty of sin.
c20631	Fathers shall not be put to death for their children,
c20632	nor children for their fathers;
c20633	each ... for his own sin.
c20634	is to die
c20635	Do not deny justice to the foreigner or the fatherless,
c20636	and do not take a widow’s cloak as security.
c20637	Remember
c20638	that you were slaves in Egypt,
c20639	and the LORD your God redeemed you from that place.
c20640	Therefore I am commanding
c20641	you to do this.
c20642	If you are harvesting in your field
c20643	and forget a sheaf [there],
c20644	do not go back
c20645	to get it.
c20646	It is to be left for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow,
c20647	so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
c20648	When you beat the olives from your trees,
c20649	you must not go over the branches again.
c20650	What remains will be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow.
c20651	When you gather the grapes of your vineyard,
c20652	you must not go over [the vines] again.
c20653	What remains will be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow.
c20654	Remember
c20655	that you were slaves in the land of Egypt.
c20656	Therefore I am commanding
c20657	you to do this.
c20658	If there is a dispute between men,
c20659	they are to go to court
c20660	to be judged,
c20661	so that the innocent may be acquitted
c20662	and the guilty condemned.
c20664	If the guilty man deserves to be beaten,
c20665	the judge shall have him lie down
c20666	and be flogged in his presence with the number of lashes his crime deserves.
c20667	He may receive ... than forty {lashes},
c20668	no more
c20669	lest ... any more
c20670	be beaten
c20671	than that
c20672	your brother ... and be degraded in your sight.
c20673	Do not muzzle an ox
c20674	while it is treading out the grain.
c20675	When brothers dwell together
c20676	and one of them dies
c20677	without a son,
c20678	the widow must not marry outside [the family].
c20679	Her husband’s brother
c20680	is to take her as his wife
c20681	and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law for her.
c20683	The first son
c20684	she bears
c20685	will carry on the name of the dead brother,
c20686	so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
c20687	But if the man does not want
c20688	to marry his brother’s widow,
c20689	she is to go to the elders at the city gate
c20690	and say,
c20691	“My husband’s brother refuses
c20692	to preserve his brother’s name in Israel.
c20693	He is not willing
c20694	to perform the duty of a brother-in-law for me.”
c20695	Then the elders of his city shall summon him
c20696	and speak with him.
c20697	If he persists
c20698	and says,
c20699	“I do not want
c20700	to marry her,”
c20701	his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders,
c20702	remove his sandal,
c20703	spit in his face,
c20705	and declare,
c20706	“This is what is done to the man
c20707	who will not maintain his brother’s line.”
c20708	And his family name in Israel will be called
c20709	“The House of the Unsandaled.”
c20710	If two men are fighting,
c20711	and the wife of one steps in
c20712	to rescue her husband from the one striking him,
c20713	and she reaches out her hand
c20714	and grabs his genitals,
c20715	you are to cut off her hand.
c20716	You must show her no pity.
c20717	You shall not have two differing weights in your bag, one heavy and one light.
c20718	You shall not have two differing measures in your house, a larger and a smaller.
c20719	You must maintain accurate and honest weights
c20720	[and] measures,
c20721	so that you may live long in the land
c20722	the LORD your God is giving you.
c20723	For everyone who behaves dishonestly in regard to these things is detestable to the LORD your God.
c20724	Remember
c20725	what the Amalekites did to you along your way
c20726	from Egypt,
c20727	how they met you on your journey
c20728	and they attacked all
c20729	your stragglers;
c20730	when you were tired and weary,
c20731	they had no fear of God.
c20733	When the LORD your God gives you rest from the enemies all around you in the land
c20734	[He] is giving ... as an inheritance,
c20735	you to possess
c20736	you are to blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.
c20737	Do not forget!
c20739	When you enter the land
c20740	the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance,
c20741	and you take possession of it
c20742	and settle in it,
c20743	you must take some of the firstfruits of all the produce of the ground
c20744	that you bring in from the land
c20745	the LORD your God is giving you ... that
c20746	and put [them] in a basket.
c20747	Then go to the place
c20748	the LORD your God will choose
c20749	as a dwelling for His name,
c20750	go to the priest
c20751	who is serving at that time,
c20752	and say to him,
c20753	“I declare today to the LORD your God
c20754	that I have entered the land
c20755	which the LORD swore to our fathers
c20756	to give us.”
c20757	Then the priest shall take the basket from your hands
c20758	and place it before the altar of the LORD your God,
c20759	and you are to declare
c20760	before the LORD your God,
c20761	“My father was a wandering Aramean,
c20762	and he went down to Egypt
c20763	few in number and lived there
c20764	and became a great nation, mighty and numerous.
c20765	But the Egyptians mistreated us
c20766	and afflicted us,
c20767	putting us to hard labor.
c20768	So we called out to the LORD, the God of our fathers;
c20769	and the LORD heard our voice
c20770	and saw our misery, toil, and oppression.
c20771	Then the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror, signs, and wonders.
c20772	And He brought us to this place
c20773	and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
c20774	And now,
c20775	behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land
c20776	that ... have given me.”
c20777	You, O LORD,
c20778	Then you are to place [the basket] before the LORD your God
c20779	and bow down before Him.
c20780	So you shall rejoice— ... in all the good
c20781	things the LORD your God has given to you and your household.
c20782	you, the Levite, and the foreigner dwelling
c20783	among you—
c20784	When you have finished laying aside
c20785	a tenth of all of your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe,
c20786	you are to give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow,
c20787	that they may eat ... within your gates.
c20788	and be filled
c20789	Then you shall declare in the presence of the LORD your God,
c20790	“I have removed from [my] house the sacred [portion]
c20791	and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all the commandments
c20792	You have given me.
c20793	I have not transgressed ... Your commandments.
c20794	or forgotten
c20795	I have not eaten any of [the sacred portion] while in mourning,
c20796	or removed any of it while unclean,
c20797	or offered any of it for the dead.
c20798	I have obeyed the LORD my God;
c20799	I have done everything
c20800	You commanded me.
c20801	Look down from Your holy habitation, from heaven,
c20802	and bless Your people Israel and the land
c20803	You have given us, as
c20804	You swore to our fathers,
c20805	a land flowing with milk and honey.”
c20806	The LORD your God commands you this day
c20807	to follow these statutes and ordinances.
c20808	You must be careful
c20809	to follow them with all your heart and all your soul.
c20810	Today you have proclaimed that the LORD
c20811	is your God
c20812	and that you will walk in His ways,
c20813	keep His statutes and commandments and ordinances,
c20814	and listen to His voice.
c20815	And today the LORD has proclaimed you
c20816	to be His people, a treasured possession
c20817	as He promised,
c20818	and that you are to keep all His commandments,
c20819	and that He will set you high ... above all the nations
c20820	He has made,
c20821	in praise and name and honor
c20822	and that you will be a holy people to the LORD your God
c20823	as He promised.
c20824	Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people,
c20826	“Keep all the commandments
c20827	I am giving you today.
c20828	And on the day
c20829	you cross the Jordan into the land
c20830	the LORD your God is giving you,
c20831	you are to set up large stones
c20832	and coat them with plaster.
c20833	Write on them all the words of this law
c20834	when you have crossed over
c20835	to enter the land
c20836	the LORD your God is giving you,
c20837	a land flowing with milk and honey,
c20838	just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
c20839	And
c20840	when you have crossed the Jordan,
c20841	you are to set up these stones
c20842	as I am commanding you today,
c20843	on Mount Ebal,
c20844	and you are to coat them with plaster.
c20845	Moreover, you shall build there an altar to the LORD your God,
c20846	an altar of stones.
c20847	You must not use any iron tool on them.
c20848	You shall build the altar of the LORD your God with uncut stones
c20849	and offer upon it burnt offerings to the LORD your God.
c20850	you are to sacrifice [your] peace offerings,
c20851	There ... eating them
c20852	and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God.
c20853	And you shall write ... upon these stones all the words of this law.”
c20854	distinctly
c20855	Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel:
c20857	“Be silent,
c20858	and listen!
c20859	O Israel,
c20860	This day you have become the people of the LORD your God.
c20861	You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God
c20862	and follow His commandments and statutes
c20863	I am giving you today.”
c20864	On that day Moses commanded the people:
c20866	these [tribes] shall stand
c20867	to bless the people:
c20868	on Mount Gerizim
c20869	“When you have crossed the Jordan,
c20870	Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
c20871	And these [tribes] shall stand on Mount Ebal to deliver the curse:
c20872	Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
c20873	Then the Levites
c20874	shall proclaim in a loud voice to every Israelite:
c20875	‘Cursed [is] the man
c20876	who makes a carved idol or molten image— which is detestable to the LORD, the work of the hands of a craftsman—
c20877	and sets it up in secret.’
c20878	And {let} all the people say,
c20880	‘Amen!’
c20881	‘Cursed [is]
c20882	he who dishonors his father or mother.’
c20883	And {let} all the people say,
c20884	‘Amen!’
c20885	‘Cursed [is]
c20886	he who moves his neighbor’s boundary stone.’
c20887	And {let} all the people say,
c20888	‘Amen!’
c20889	‘Cursed is
c20890	he who lets a blind man wander in the road.’
c20891	And {let} all the people say,
c20892	‘Amen!’
c20893	‘Cursed is
c20894	he who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow.’
c20895	And {let} all the people say,
c20896	‘Amen!’
c20897	‘Cursed is
c20898	he who sleeps with his father’s wife,
c20899	for he has violated his father’s marriage bed.’
c20900	And {let} all the people say,
c20901	‘Amen!’
c20902	‘Cursed is
c20903	he who has sexual relations with any animal.’
c20904	And {let} all the people say,
c20905	‘Amen!’
c20906	‘Cursed is
c20907	he who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’
c20908	And {let} all the people say,
c20909	‘Amen!’
c20910	‘Cursed is
c20911	he who sleeps with his mother-in-law.’
c20912	And {let} all the people say,
c20913	‘Amen!’
c20914	‘Cursed is
c20915	he who strikes down his neighbor in secret.’
c20916	And {let} all the people say,
c20917	‘Amen!’
c20918	‘Cursed is
c20919	he who accepts a bribe
c20920	to kill an innocent person.’
c20921	And {let} all the people say,
c20922	‘Amen!’
c20923	‘Cursed is
c20924	he who does not put the words of this law
c20925	into practice.’
c20926	And {let} all the people say,
c20927	‘Amen!’”
c20928	Now
c20929	if you faithfully obey the voice of the LORD your God
c20930	and are careful
c20931	to follow all His commandments
c20932	I am giving you today,
c20933	the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.
c20934	All these blessings will come upon you
c20935	and overtake you,
c20936	if you will obey the voice of the LORD your God:
c20937	You will be blessed in the city
c20938	and blessed in the country.
c20939	The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the produce of your land, the offspring of your livestock, the calves of your herds, and the lambs of your flocks.
c20940	Your basket and kneading bowl will be blessed.
c20941	You will be blessed
c20942	when you come in
c20943	and blessed when you
c20944	go out.
c20945	The LORD will cause the enemies
c20946	who rise up against you
c20947	to be defeated before you.
c20948	They will march out against you in one direction
c20949	but flee from you in seven.
c20950	The LORD will decree a blessing on your barns and on everything to which you put your hand;
c20951	will bless you in the land
c20952	the LORD your God ... He is giving you.
c20953	The LORD will establish you as His holy people,
c20954	just as He has sworn to you,
c20955	if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God
c20956	and walk in His ways.
c20957	Then all the peoples of the earth will see
c20958	that you are called by the name of the LORD,
c20959	and they will stand in awe of you.
c20960	The LORD will make you prosper abundantly in the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land, in the land
c20961	the LORD swore to your fathers
c20962	to give you.
c20963	The LORD will open the heavens, His abundant storehouse,
c20964	to send rain to your land in season
c20965	and to bless all the work of your hands.
c20966	You will lend to many nations,
c20967	but borrow from none.
c20968	The LORD will make you the head
c20969	and not the tail;
c20970	you will only move upward
c20971	and never downward,
c20972	if you hear ... the commandments of the LORD your God,
c20973	which I am giving you today.
c20974	and carefully
c20975	follow
c20976	Do not turn aside ... from any of the words
c20977	I command you today,
c20978	to the right or to the left
c20979	and do not go after other gods
c20980	to serve them.
c20982	If, however, you do not obey the LORD your God
c20983	by carefully
c20984	following all His commandments and statutes
c20985	I am giving you today,
c20986	all these curses will come upon you
c20987	and overtake you:
c20988	You will be cursed in the city
c20989	and cursed in the country.
c20990	Your basket and kneading bowl will be cursed.
c20991	The fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the produce of your land, the calves of your herds, and the lambs of your flocks.
c20992	You will be cursed
c20993	when you come in
c20994	and cursed when you
c20995	go out.
c20996	The LORD will send curses upon you, confusion and rebuke in all to which you put your hand,
c20998	until you are destroyed
c20999	and quickly perish because of the wickedness you have committed
c21000	in forsaking Him.
c21001	The LORD will make the pestilence cling to you
c21002	until He has exterminated you from the land
c21003	you are entering
c21004	to possess.
c21005	The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with severe heat and drought, with blight and mildew;
c21006	these will pursue
c21007	you until you perish.
c21008	The sky ... will be
c21009	over your head
c21010	bronze,
c21011	and the earth
c21012	beneath you
c21013	iron.
c21014	The LORD will turn the rain of your land into dust and powder;
c21015	it will descend on you from the sky
c21016	until you are destroyed.
c21017	The LORD will cause
c21018	you to be defeated before your enemies.
c21019	You will march out against them in one direction
c21020	but flee from them in seven.
c21021	You will be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
c21022	Your corpses will be food for all the birds of the air and beasts of the earth,
c21023	with no one to scare them away.
c21024	The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt, with tumors and scabs and itch,
c21025	from which you cannot
c21026	be cured.
c21027	The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness, and confusion of mind,
c21028	so that at noon you will grope about
c21029	like a blind man in the darkness.
c21030	You will not prosper in your ways.
c21031	Day after day you will be oppressed and plundered,
c21032	with no one to save you.
c21033	You will be pledged in marriage to a woman,
c21034	but another man will violate her.
c21035	You will build a house
c21036	but not live in it.
c21037	You will plant a vineyard
c21038	but not enjoy its fruit.
c21039	Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes,
c21040	but you will not eat any of it.
c21041	Your donkey will be taken away
c21042	and not returned to you.
c21043	Your flock will be given to your enemies,
c21044	and no one will help you.
c21045	Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation,
c21046	while your eyes ... looking
c21047	grow weary ... for them day after day,
c21048	with no power in your hand.
c21049	A people ... will eat the produce of your land and of all your toil.
c21050	you do not know
c21051	All your days you will be oppressed and crushed.
c21052	You will be driven mad by the sights
c21053	you see.
c21054	The LORD will afflict you with painful, ... boils on your knees and thighs,
c21055	incurable
c21057	from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.
c21058	The LORD will bring you and the king
c21059	you appoint
c21060	to a nation
c21061	neither you nor your fathers have known,
c21062	and there you will worship other gods, [gods] of wood and stone.
c21063	You will become an object of horror, scorn, and ridicule among all the nations
c21064	to which the LORD will drive you.
c21065	You will sow much seed in the field
c21066	but harvest little,
c21067	because the locust will consume it.
c21068	You will plant ... vineyards,
c21069	and cultivate
c21070	but will neither drink the wine
c21071	nor gather [the grapes],
c21072	because worms will eat them.
c21073	You will have olive trees throughout your territory,
c21074	but you will never anoint yourself with oil,
c21075	because the olives will drop off.
c21076	You will father sons and daughters,
c21077	but they will not remain yours,
c21078	because they will go into captivity.
c21079	Swarms of locusts will consume all your trees and the produce of your land.
c21080	The foreigner living
c21081	among you
c21082	will rise higher and higher above you,
c21083	while you sink down lower and lower.
c21084	He will lend to you,
c21085	but you will not lend to him.
c21086	He will be the head,
c21087	and you will be the tail.
c21088	All these curses will come upon you.
c21089	They will pursue you
c21090	and overtake you
c21091	until you are destroyed,
c21092	since you did not obey the LORD your God
c21093	and keep the commandments and statutes
c21094	He gave you.
c21095	These curses will be a sign and a wonder upon you
c21096	and your descendants forever.
c21097	Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joy and gladness of heart in all your abundance,
c21098	you will serve your enemies
c21099	the LORD will send against you
c21100	in famine, thirst, nakedness, and destitution.
c21101	He will place an iron yoke on your neck
c21102	until He has destroyed you.
c21103	The LORD will bring a nation from afar, from the ends of the earth, ... upon you
c21104	to swoop down ... like an eagle,
c21105	a nation
c21106	whose language you will not understand,
c21107	a ruthless nation
c21108	with no respect for the old
c21109	and no pity for the young.
c21110	They will eat the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your land
c21111	until you are destroyed.
c21112	They will leave you no grain or new wine or oil, no calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks,
c21113	until they have caused you to perish.
c21114	They will besiege all your cities,
c21115	until the high and fortified walls ... have fallen
c21116	in which you trust
c21117	in all the land.
c21118	They will besiege all your cities throughout the land
c21119	the LORD your God has given you.
c21120	you will eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of your sons and daughters
c21121	the LORD your God has given you.
c21122	During the siege and hardship
c21123	your enemy will impose on you,
c21124	man
c21125	gentle ... among you
c21126	The most ... and refined
c21127	will begrudge his brother, the wife he embraces, and the rest of his children
c21128	who have survived,
c21129	refusing to share with any of them the flesh of his children
c21130	that he will eat
c21131	because he has nothing left in the siege and hardship
c21132	your enemy will impose on all your cities.
c21133	The most gentle and refined woman among you,
c21134	she would not venture ... the sole of her foot
c21135	to set ... on the ground,
c21136	and refined
c21137	so gentle
c21138	will begrudge the husband she embraces and her son and daughter
c21139	the afterbirth
c21140	that comes from between her legs
c21141	and the children
c21142	she bears,
c21143	because she will secretly eat them for lack of anything else in the siege and dire straits
c21144	your enemy will impose on you in all your cities.
c21145	If you are not careful
c21146	to observe all the words of this law
c21147	which are written in this book,
c21148	that you may fear this glorious and awesome name— the LORD your God—
c21149	He {will bring} upon you and your descendants extraordinary disasters, severe and lasting plagues, and terrible and chronic sicknesses.
c21150	He will afflict you again with all the diseases ... in Egypt,
c21151	you dreaded
c21152	and they will cling to you.
c21153	will also ... every sickness and plague
c21154	not recorded in this Book of the Law,
c21155	The LORD ... bring upon you
c21156	until you are destroyed.
c21157	will be left few in number,
c21158	You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky
c21159	because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.
c21161	Just as it pleased the LORD
c21162	to make you prosper
c21163	and to multiply you,
c21164	so also it will please Him
c21165	to exterminate you
c21166	and destroy you.
c21167	And you will be uprooted from the land
c21168	you are entering
c21169	to possess.
c21170	Then the LORD will scatter you among all the nations, from one end of the earth to the other,
c21171	and there you will worship other gods,
c21172	which neither you nor your fathers have known.
c21173	[gods] of wood and stone,
c21174	Among those nations you will find no repose,
c21175	not even a resting place for the sole of your foot.
c21176	There the LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a despairing soul.
c21177	So your life will hang in doubt before you,
c21178	and you will be afraid night and day,
c21179	never certain of survival.
c21180	In the morning you will say,
c21181	‘If only it were evening!’
c21182	and in the evening you will say,
c21183	‘If only it were morning!’—
c21184	because of the dread in your hearts
c21185	of the terrifying
c21186	sights
c21187	you will see.
c21188	The LORD will return you to Egypt in ships by a route
c21189	that I said
c21190	you should never ... again.
c21191	see
c21192	There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves,
c21193	but no one will buy you.”
c21194	These are the words of the covenant
c21195	the LORD commanded Moses
c21196	to make with the Israelites in the land of Moab,
c21197	in addition to the covenant
c21198	He had made with them at Horeb.
c21199	Moses summoned all Israel ... to them,
c21200	and proclaimed
c21201	“You have seen ... everything
c21202	with your own eyes ... the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials, and to all his land.
c21203	the great trials,
c21204	You saw with your own eyes
c21205	and those miraculous signs and wonders.
c21206	the LORD has not given you a mind
c21207	to understand,
c21208	eyes
c21209	to see,
c21210	or ears
c21211	to hear.
c21212	Yet to this day
c21213	During the forty years I led you in the wilderness,
c21214	neither your clothes ... wore out;
c21215	nor the sandals on your feet
c21216	you did not eat bread
c21217	or drink wine or strong drink,
c21218	so that you might know
c21219	that I am the LORD your God.
c21220	When you reached this place,
c21221	Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out
c21222	against us
c21223	in battle,
c21224	but we defeated them.
c21225	We took their land
c21226	and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
c21227	So keep ... the words of this covenant,
c21228	and follow
c21229	that you may prosper in all
c21230	you do.
c21231	All of you are standing today before the LORD your God— you leaders of tribes, elders, officials, and all the men of Israel,
c21232	you children, wives, and the foreigners
c21233	in your camps
c21234	who cut your wood and draw your water—
c21235	so that you may enter into the covenant of the LORD your God, ... and into His oath,
c21236	which He is making with you today,
c21237	and so that He may establish you today as His people,
c21238	and He may be your God
c21239	as He promised you
c21240	and as He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
c21241	I am making this covenant and this oath not only with you,
c21242	but
c21243	also with those who ... here with us
c21244	are standing ... today in the presence of the LORD our God,
c21245	as well as with those who are not here today.
c21246	For you yourselves know
c21247	how we lived in the land of Egypt
c21248	and passed through the nations
c21249	as you traveled.
c21250	You saw the abominations and idols ... made of wood and stone, of silver and gold.
c21251	among them
c21252	Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you
c21253	today whose heart turns away from the LORD our God
c21254	to go
c21255	and worship the gods of those nations.
c21256	Make sure there is no root among you
c21257	that bears such poisonous and bitter fruit,
c21258	‘I will have
c21259	because when such a person hears the words of this oath,
c21260	he may invoke a blessing on himself,
c21261	saying,
c21262	peace,
c21263	even though I walk in the stubbornness of my own heart.’
c21264	This will bring disaster on the watered [land] as well as the dry.
c21265	The LORD will never be willing
c21266	to forgive him.
c21267	Instead, [His] anger and jealousy will burn against that man,
c21268	and every curse ... will fall upon him.
c21269	written in this book
c21270	The LORD will blot out his name from under heaven
c21271	and single him out for disaster from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant
c21272	written in this Book of the Law.
c21273	Then the generation to come— your sons
c21274	who follow you
c21275	and the foreigner
c21276	who comes from a distant land—
c21277	will see the plagues of the land and the sicknesses
c21278	the LORD has inflicted on it.
c21279	of brimstone and salt,
c21280	All its soil will be a burning waste
c21281	unsown
c21282	and unproductive,
c21283	with no plant growing on it,
c21284	just like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim,
c21285	which the LORD overthrew in His fierce anger.
c21286	All the nations will ask,
c21287	‘Why has the LORD done this to this land?
c21288	Why this great outburst of anger?’
c21289	And [the people] will answer,
c21290	‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers,
c21291	which He made with
c21292	them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.
c21293	They went
c21294	and served other gods,
c21295	and they worshiped
c21296	gods
c21297	they had not known—
c21298	gods that [the LORD] had not given to them.
c21299	Therefore the LORD’s anger burned against this land,
c21300	and He brought upon it every curse
c21301	written in this book.
c21302	The LORD uprooted them from their land in His anger, rage, and great wrath,
c21303	and He cast them into another land,
c21304	where they are today.’
c21305	The secret [things belong] to the LORD our God,
c21306	but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever,
c21307	so that we may follow all the words of this law.
c21309	When all these things come upon you— the blessings and curses
c21310	I have set before you— ... to which
c21311	and you call [them] to mind in all the nations
c21312	the LORD your God has banished you,
c21313	return to the LORD your God
c21314	and obey His voice with all
c21315	I am giving you today,
c21316	and when you and your children ... your heart and all your soul according to everything
c21317	then He will restore you from captivity ... your God
c21318	and have compassion on you
c21320	and gather you from all the nations
c21321	to which the LORD ... has scattered you.
c21322	Even if you have been banished to the ends of the earth,
c21323	He will gather you ... from there.
c21324	and return you
c21325	And the LORD your God will bring you into the land
c21326	your fathers possessed,
c21327	and you will take possession of it.
c21328	He will cause you to prosper
c21329	and multiply you more than your fathers.
c21330	The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants,
c21331	and you will love Him with all your heart and all your soul,
c21332	so that you may live.
c21333	Then the LORD your God will put all these curses upon your enemies ... hate you
c21334	who ... and persecute you.
c21335	And you will again
c21336	obey the voice of the LORD
c21337	and follow all His commandments
c21338	I am giving you today.
c21339	So the LORD your God will make you abound in all the work of your hands [and] in the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land. ... your prosperity,
c21340	Indeed, the LORD will again
c21341	delight in
c21342	as He delighted in that of your fathers,
c21343	if you obey the LORD your God
c21344	by keeping His commandments and statutes
c21345	that are written in this book of the law,
c21346	[and] if you turn to Him with all your heart and all your soul.
c21347	For this commandment
c21348	I give you today
c21349	is not too difficult for you
c21350	or beyond your reach.
c21351	It is not in heaven,
c21352	that you would need to ask,
c21353	“Who will ascend into heaven
c21354	to get it for us
c21355	and proclaim it,
c21356	that we may obey it?”
c21357	And it is not beyond the sea,
c21358	that you would need to ask,
c21359	“Who will cross the sea
c21360	to get it for us
c21361	and proclaim it,
c21362	that we may obey it?”
c21363	But the word [is] very near you,
c21364	in your mouth and in your heart,
c21365	so that you may obey it.
c21366	See,
c21367	I have set before you today life and prosperity, as well as death and disaster.
c21368	For I am commanding you today
c21369	to love the LORD your God,
c21370	to walk in His ways,
c21371	and to keep His commandments, statutes, and ordinances,
c21372	so that you may live
c21373	and increase,
c21374	and the LORD your God may bless you in the land
c21375	you are entering
c21376	to possess.
c21377	But if your heart turns away
c21378	and you do not listen,
c21379	but are drawn away
c21380	to bow down to other gods
c21381	and worship them,
c21382	I declare to you today
c21383	that you will surely perish;
c21384	you shall not prolong [your] days in the land
c21385	you are crossing the Jordan
c21387	to possess.
c21388	I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today
c21389	that I have set before you life and death,
c21390	blessing and cursing.
c21391	So choose life,
c21392	so that you and your descendants may live,
c21393	and that you may love the LORD your God,
c21394	obey Him,
c21395	and hold fast to Him.
c21396	For He [is] your life, and He will prolong your life
c21397	in the land
c21398	the LORD swore ... to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
c21399	to give
c21400	Then Moses went out
c21401	and spoke these words to all Israel:
c21403	“I am now a hundred and twenty years old;
c21404	I am no longer
c21405	able to come
c21406	and go,
c21407	and the LORD has said to me,
c21408	‘You shall not cross the Jordan.’
c21409	The LORD your God
c21410	Himself will cross over ahead of you.
c21411	He will destroy these nations before you,
c21412	and you will dispossess them.
c21413	Joshua
c21414	will cross ahead of you,
c21415	as the LORD has said.
c21416	And the LORD will do to them
c21417	as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, ... along with their land.
c21418	when He destroyed them
c21419	The LORD will deliver them over to you,
c21420	and you must do to them exactly as
c21421	I have commanded you.
c21422	Be strong
c21423	and courageous;
c21424	do not be afraid
c21425	or terrified of them,
c21426	for it is the LORD your God
c21427	who
c21428	goes with you;
c21429	He will never leave you
c21430	[nor] forsake you.”
c21431	Then Moses called for Joshua
c21432	and said to him in the presence of all Israel,
c21433	“Be strong
c21434	and courageous,
c21435	for you will go with this people into the land
c21436	the LORD swore to their fathers
c21437	to give them,
c21438	and you shall give it to them as an inheritance.
c21439	The LORD
c21440	Himself
c21441	goes before you;
c21442	He will be with you.
c21443	He will never leave you
c21444	or forsake you. Do not
c21445	be afraid
c21446	or discouraged.”
c21447	So Moses wrote down this law
c21448	and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi,
c21449	who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
c21450	and to all the elders of Israel.
c21451	Then Moses commanded them,
c21453	“At the end of [every] seven years, at the appointed time in the year of remission [of debt], during the Feast of Tabernacles,
c21454	when all Israel comes
c21455	before of the LORD your God at the place
c21456	He will choose,
c21457	you are to read this law in the hearing of all Israel.
c21458	Assemble the people— men, women, children, and the foreigners
c21459	within your gates—
c21460	so that they may listen
c21461	and learn
c21462	to fear the LORD your God
c21463	carefully
c21464	and follow ... all the words of this law.
c21465	Then their children
c21466	who do not know [the law]
c21467	will listen
c21468	and learn
c21469	to fear the LORD your God, as
c21470	long as you live in the land
c21471	you are crossing the Jordan
c21472	to possess.”
c21473	Then the LORD said to Moses,
c21474	“Behold, the time ... is near.
c21475	of your death
c21476	Call Joshua
c21477	and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting,
c21478	so that I may commission him.”
c21479	So Moses and Joshua went
c21480	and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting.
c21481	Then the LORD appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud,
c21482	and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent.
c21483	And the LORD said to Moses,
c21484	“You will soon rest with your fathers,
c21485	and these people will rise up
c21486	and prostitute themselves with the foreign gods of the land
c21487	they are entering.
c21488	They will forsake
c21489	Me and break the covenant
c21490	I have made with them.
c21491	On that day My anger will burn against them,
c21492	and I will abandon them
c21493	and hide My face from them,
c21494	so that they will be
c21495	consumed,
c21496	and many troubles and afflictions will befall them.
c21497	On that day they will say,
c21498	‘Have not
c21499	because our God is no longer with us?’
c21500	these disasters come upon us
c21501	And on that day I will surely hide My face because of all the evil
c21502	they have done
c21503	by turning to other gods.
c21504	Now therefore,
c21505	write down for yourselves this song
c21506	and teach it to the Israelites;
c21507	have them recite it,
c21508	so that [it] may be a witness for Me against [them].
c21509	When I have brought them into the land
c21510	I swore to give their fathers,
c21511	a land flowing with milk and honey,
c21512	they will eat
c21513	their fill
c21514	and prosper.
c21515	Then they will turn to other gods
c21516	and worship them,
c21517	and they will reject Me
c21518	and break My covenant.
c21520	And when many troubles and afflictions have come upon them,
c21521	this song will testify against them,
c21522	because it will not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants.
c21523	For I know their inclination,
c21525	even before I bring them into the land
c21526	I swore to give them.”
c21527	So that very day Moses wrote down this song
c21528	and taught it to the Israelites.
c21529	Then the LORD commissioned Joshua son of Nun
c21530	and said,
c21531	“Be strong
c21532	and courageous,
c21533	for you will bring the Israelites into the land
c21534	I swore to give them,
c21535	and I will be with you.”
c21537	When Moses had finished
c21538	writing in a book the words of this law
c21539	from beginning to end,
c21540	he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD:
c21542	“Take this Book of the Law
c21543	and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God,
c21544	so that it may remain there as a witness against you.
c21545	For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are.
c21547	against ... while I am still alive,
c21548	If you are already rebelling ... the LORD
c21549	how much more will you rebel after my death!
c21550	Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and [all] your officers
c21551	so that I may speak these words in their hearing
c21552	and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
c21553	For I know ... after my death
c21554	that ... you will become utterly corrupt
c21555	and turn from the path
c21556	I have commanded you.
c21557	And in the days {to come}, disaster will befall you
c21558	because you will do
c21559	evil in the sight of the LORD
c21560	to provoke Him to anger by the work of your hands.”
c21561	Then Moses recited aloud to the whole assembly of Israel the words of this song
c21562	[from beginning] to end:
c21563	“Give ear,
c21564	O heavens,
c21565	and I will speak;
c21566	hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
c21567	Let my teaching fall like rain
c21568	and my speech settle like dew,
c21569	like gentle rain on new grass,
c21570	like showers on tender plants.
c21571	For I will proclaim the name of the LORD.
c21572	Ascribe greatness to our God!
c21573	[He is] the Rock,
c21574	His work is perfect;
c21575	all His ways are just.
c21576	A God of faithfulness without injustice,
c21577	righteous and upright [is] He.
c21578	[His people] have acted corruptly toward Him;
c21579	their spot [is] not that of His children,
c21580	but of a perverse and crooked generation.
c21581	Is this how you repay the LORD,
c21582	O foolish and senseless people?
c21583	Is He not your Father
c21584	and Creator?
c21585	Has He not made you
c21586	and established you?
c21587	Remember the days of old;
c21588	consider the years long past.
c21589	Ask your father,
c21590	and he will tell you,
c21591	your elders,
c21592	and they will inform you.
c21593	When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,
c21594	when He divided the sons of man,
c21595	He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God.
c21596	But the LORD’s portion is His people,
c21597	Jacob His allotted inheritance.
c21598	He found him in a desolate land, in a barren, howling wilderness;
c21599	He surrounded him,
c21600	He instructed him,
c21601	He guarded him as the apple of His eye.
c21602	As an eagle
c21603	stirs up its nest
c21604	and hovers over its young,
c21605	He spread His wings
c21606	to catch them;
c21607	He carried them on His pinions.
c21608	The LORD alone led him,
c21609	and no foreign god [was] with him.
c21610	He made him ride on the heights of the land
c21611	and fed him the produce of the field.
c21612	He nourished him with honey from the rock
c21613	and oil from the flinty crag,
c21614	with curds from the herd and milk from the flock, with the fat of lambs,
c21615	with rams from Bashan, and goats, with the choicest grains of wheat.
c21616	From the juice of the finest grapes you drank the wine.
c21617	But Jeshurun grew fat
c21618	and kicked—
c21619	becoming fat,
c21620	bloated,
c21621	and gorged.
c21622	He abandoned the God
c21623	who made him
c21624	and scorned the Rock of his salvation.
c21625	They provoked His jealousy with foreign gods;
c21626	they enraged Him with abominations.
c21627	They sacrificed to demons,
c21628	not to God,
c21629	to gods
c21630	they had not known,
c21631	to newly arrived [gods],
c21633	which your fathers did not fear.
c21634	the Rock
c21635	who brought you forth;
c21636	You ignored
c21637	you forgot the God
c21638	who gave you birth.
c21639	When the LORD saw this,
c21640	He rejected [them], provoked to anger by His sons and daughters.
c21641	He said:
c21642	I will hide My face from them; ... they
c21643	I will see
c21644	what [will be] their end.
c21645	For ... are a perverse generation—
c21646	children
c21647	of unfaithfulness.
c21648	They have provoked My jealousy by [that which is] not God;
c21649	they have enraged Me with their worthless idols.
c21650	So I will make them jealous by those who are not a people;
c21651	I will make them angry by a nation without understanding.
c21652	For a fire has been kindled by My anger,
c21653	and it burns to the depths of Sheol;
c21654	it consumes the earth and its produce,
c21655	and scorches the foundations of the mountains.
c21656	I will heap disasters upon them;
c21657	I will spend My arrows against them.
c21658	They will be wasted from hunger,
c21659	ravaged by pestilence and bitter plague;
c21660	I will send the fangs of wild beasts against them, with the venom of vipers that slither in the dust.
c21661	Outside, the sword will take their children,
c21662	and inside, terror will strike
c21663	the young man and the young woman,
c21664	the infant and the gray-haired man.
c21665	I would have said
c21666	I will cut them to pieces
c21667	and blot out their memory from mankind,
c21668	if I had not dreaded the taunt of the enemy,
c21669	their adversaries misunderstand
c21670	lest ... and say:
c21671	‘Our own hand has prevailed;
c21672	it was not the LORD who did all this.’
c21673	Israel is a nation devoid of counsel
c21674	with no understanding among them.
c21675	If only they were wise,
c21676	they would understand it;
c21677	they would comprehend their fate.
c21678	How could one man pursue a thousand,
c21679	or two put ten thousand to flight,
c21680	unless
c21681	their Rock had sold them,
c21682	unless the LORD had given them up?
c21683	For their rock is not like our Rock,
c21684	even our enemies concede.
c21685	But their vine [is] from the vine of Sodom
c21686	and from the fields of Gomorrah.
c21687	Their grapes are poisonous;
c21688	Their clusters [are] bitter.
c21689	Their wine is the venom of serpents,
c21690	the deadly poison of cobras.
c21691	Have I not stored up these things, ... within My
c21692	sealed up ... vaults?
c21693	Vengeance is Mine; I will repay. In due time
c21694	their foot will slip;
c21695	for their day of disaster is near,
c21696	is coming quickly.
c21697	and their doom
c21698	For the LORD will judge His people
c21699	and have compassion on His servants
c21700	when He sees
c21701	that their strength is gone
c21702	and no one [remains], slave or free.
c21703	He will say:
c21704	Where are their gods,
c21705	the rock
c21706	in which they took refuge,
c21707	which ate the fat of their sacrifices
c21708	and drank the wine of their drink offerings?
c21709	Let them rise up
c21710	and help you;
c21711	let them give you shelter!
c21712	See now
c21713	that I
c21714	am He; ... I
c21715	there is no God besides Me.
c21716	bring death ... and I
c21717	and I give life;
c21718	I wound
c21719	heal,
c21720	and [there is] no one who can deliver from My hand.
c21721	For I lift up My hand to heaven
c21722	and declare:
c21723	As surely as I live forever,
c21724	when I sharpen My flashing sword,
c21725	and My hand grasps it in judgment,
c21726	I will take vengeance on My adversaries
c21727	and repay those who hate Me.
c21728	I will make My arrows drunk with blood,
c21729	while My sword devours flesh— the blood of the slain and captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.
c21730	Rejoice, [O heavens, with Him, <p class=|indent2|>and let all God’s angels worship Him.]
c21731	[Rejoice,] O Gentiles,
c21732	[with] His people;
c21733	for He will avenge the blood of His children.
c21734	He will take vengeance on His adversaries<p class=|indent2|> [and repay those who hate Him];
c21735	He will cleanse His land [and] His people.”
c21736	Then Moses came
c21737	with Joshua son of Nun and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.
c21738	When Moses had finished
c21739	reciting all these words to all Israel,
c21740	he said to them,
c21741	“Take to heart all these words
c21742	I testify among you today, so that
c21743	you may command your children
c21744	to carefully
c21745	follow all the words of this law.
c21746	For they are not idle words to you,
c21747	because they are your life,
c21748	and by them you will live long in the land
c21749	you are crossing the Jordan
c21750	to possess.”
c21751	On that same day the LORD said to Moses,
c21753	“Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo,
c21754	in the land of Moab
c21755	across from Jericho,
c21756	and view the land of Canaan,
c21757	which I am giving to the Israelites as their own possession.
c21758	on the mountain ... you will die
c21759	And there ... that you climb,
c21760	and be gathered to your people,
c21761	just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor
c21762	and was gathered to his people.
c21763	For at the waters of Meribah-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you broke faith with Me among the Israelites
c21764	by failing to treat Me as holy in their presence.
c21765	Although you shall see from a distance the land
c21766	you shall not enter [it].”
c21767	that I am giving the Israelites,
c21768	This is the blessing
c21769	that Moses, the man of God, pronounced upon the Israelites before his death.
c21770	He said:
c21771	“The LORD came from Sinai
c21772	and dawned upon us from Seir;
c21773	He shone forth from Mount Paran
c21774	and came with myriads of holy ones,
c21775	with flaming fire at His right hand.
c21776	Surely You love the people;
c21777	all the holy ones [are] in Your hand,
c21778	and they sit down at Your feet;
c21779	each receives Your words—
c21780	the law that Moses gave us,
c21781	the possession of the congregation of Jacob.
c21782	So [the LORD] became King in Jeshurun
c21783	when the leaders of the people gathered, together with the tribes of Israel.
c21784	Let Reuben live
c21785	and not die,
c21786	nor his men be few.”
c21787	And concerning Judah
c21788	he said:
c21789	hear
c21790	“O LORD,
c21791	the cry of Judah
c21792	and bring him to his people.
c21793	With his own hands he defends his cause,
c21794	but may You be a help against his foes.”
c21795	Concerning Levi he said:
c21796	“[Give] Your Thummim [to Levi] and Your Urim to Your godly one,
c21797	whom You tested at Massah
c21798	and contested at the waters of Meribah.
c21799	He said of his father and mother,
c21800	‘I do not consider them.’
c21801	He disregarded his brothers
c21802	and did not know his own sons,
c21803	for they kept Your word
c21804	and maintained Your covenant.
c21805	They will teach Your ordinances to Jacob
c21806	and Your law to Israel;
c21807	they will set incense before You
c21808	and whole burnt offerings on Your altar.
c21809	Bless
c21810	O LORD,
c21811	his substance,
c21812	and accept the work of his hands.
c21813	Smash the loins of those who rise against him, and of his foes
c21814	so they can rise [no more].”
c21815	Concerning Benjamin he said:
c21816	“May the beloved of the LORD
c21817	rest secure in Him;
c21818	[God] shields him all day long,
c21819	and upon His shoulders he rests.”
c21820	Concerning Joseph he said:
c21821	“May his land be blessed by the LORD with the dew of heaven’s bounty and the watery depths
c21822	that lie beneath,
c21823	with the bountiful harvest from the sun
c21824	and the abundant yield of the seasons,
c21825	with the best of the ancient mountains
c21826	and the bounty of the everlasting hills,
c21827	with the choice gifts of the land and everything in it,
c21828	and with the favor of Him who dwelt in the burning bush.
c21829	May these rest on the head of Joseph and crown the brow of the prince of his brothers.
c21830	a firstborn bull
c21831	His majesty [is like]
c21832	and his horns like those of a wild ox.
c21833	With them he will gore the nations, even to the ends of the earth.
c21834	Such are the myriads of Ephraim,
c21835	and such are the thousands of Manasseh.”
c21836	Concerning Zebulun he said:
c21837	“Rejoice,
c21838	Zebulun,
c21839	in your journeys,
c21841	and Issachar,
c21842	in your tents.
c21843	They will call the peoples to a mountain;
c21844	there they will offer sacrifices of righteousness.
c21845	For they will feast on the abundance of the seas
c21846	and the hidden treasures of the sand.”
c21847	Concerning Gad he said:
c21848	“Blessed [is] he who enlarges [the domain of] Gad!
c21849	He lies down like a lion
c21850	and tears off an arm
c21851	or a head.
c21852	He chose the best [land] for himself,
c21853	because a ruler’s portion was reserved for him there.
c21854	He came with the leaders of the people;
c21855	he administered the justice of the LORD
c21856	and His ordinances for Israel.”
c21857	Concerning Dan he said:
c21858	“Dan [is] a lion’s cub,
c21859	leaping out of Bashan.”
c21860	Concerning Naphtali he said:
c21861	“Naphtali is abounding with favor,
c21862	full of the blessing of the LORD;
c21863	he shall take possession of the Sea and the south.”
c21864	Concerning Asher he said:
c21865	“May Asher be the most blessed of sons;
c21866	may he be the most favored among his brothers
c21867	and dip his foot in oil.
c21868	May the bolts of your gate be iron and bronze,
c21869	and your strength match your days.
c21870	There is none like the God
c21871	of Jeshurun,
c21872	who rides the heavens to your aid,
c21873	and the clouds in His majesty.
c21874	The eternal God is your dwelling place,
c21875	and underneath are the everlasting arms.
c21876	He drives out the enemy before you,
c21877	giving the command,
c21878	‘Destroy [him]!’
c21879	So Israel dwells securely;
c21880	the fountain of Jacob lives untroubled in a land of grain and new wine,
c21881	where even the heavens drip with dew.
c21882	Blessed [are] you, O Israel!
c21883	Who is like you,
c21884	a people
c21885	saved by the LORD? He is the shield that protects you,
c21886	the sword in which you boast.
c21887	Your enemies will cower before you,
c21888	and you shall trample their high places.”
c21889	Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,
c21890	which faces Jericho.
c21891	And the LORD showed him the whole land— from Gilead as far as Dan,
c21892	all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,
c21893	the Negev and the region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, [and] all the way to Zoar.
c21894	And the LORD said to him,
c21895	“This is the land
c21896	I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
c21897	when I said,
c21898	‘I will give it to your descendants.’
c21899	I have let you see it with your own eyes,
c21900	but you will not cross into it.”
c21901	So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had said.
c21902	And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab facing Beth-peor,
c21903	and no one to this day knows the location of his grave.
c21904	Moses [was] a hundred and twenty years old when he died,
c21905	yet his eyes were not weak,
c21906	and his vitality had not diminished.
c21907	The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days,
c21908	until the time of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.
c21909	Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom
c21910	because Moses had laid his hands on him.
c21911	So the Israelites obeyed him
c21912	and did
c21913	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c21914	Since that time, no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses,
c21915	whom the LORD knew face to face
c21916	in all the signs and wonders
c21917	the LORD sent
c21918	him to do against the land of Egypt— to Pharaoh and all his officials and all his land—
c21919	and in all the mighty acts of power and terrifying deeds ... of all
c21920	that Moses performed in the sight ... Israel.
c21921	Now after the death of His servant Moses,
c21922	the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' assistant,
c21923	saying,
c21924	“Moses My servant is dead.
c21925	Now therefore
c21926	arise,
c21927	you and all these people, [and] cross over the Jordan into the land
c21928	I am giving to the children of Israel.
c21929	every place
c21930	where the sole of your foot will tread,
c21931	I have given you
c21932	just as I promised to Moses.
c21933	Your territory shall extend from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great River Euphrates— all the land of the Hittites— and west as far as the Great Sea.
c21934	No one shall stand against you all the days of your life.
c21935	As ... Moses, so I will be with you;
c21936	I was with
c21937	I will never leave you
c21938	[or] forsake you.
c21939	Be strong
c21940	and courageous,
c21941	for you shall give these people the inheritance of the land
c21942	I swore to their fathers
c21943	I would give them.
c21944	Above all, be strong
c21945	and very courageous.
c21946	Be careful
c21947	to observe all the law
c21948	My servant Moses commanded you.
c21949	Do not turn from it to the right or to the left,
c21950	so that you may prosper wherever
c21951	you go.
c21952	This book of the Law must not depart from your mouth;
c21953	you are to recite it day and night,
c21954	so that you may carefully
c21955	observe everything
c21956	written in it.
c21957	For then you will prosper ... in all you do.
c21958	and succeed
c21959	Have I not commanded you
c21960	to be strong
c21961	and courageous?
c21962	Do not be afraid
c21963	or discouraged,
c21964	for the LORD your God is with you wherever
c21965	you go.”
c21966	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people:
c21968	“Go through the camp
c21969	and tell the people,
c21971	‘Prepare your provisions,
c21972	for within three days you will cross the Jordan
c21973	to go in
c21974	and take possession of the land
c21975	the LORD your God is giving you
c21976	for your own.’”
c21977	But to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
c21979	“Remember
c21980	what Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you
c21981	when he said,
c21982	‘The LORD your God will give you rest,
c21983	and He will give you this land.’
c21984	Your wives, your young children, and your livestock may remain in the land
c21985	Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan.
c21986	But your fighting men must be armed for battle to cross over ahead of your brothers
c21987	and help them,
c21988	until the LORD gives [them] rest as He has done for you
c21989	and [your brothers] also possess the land
c21990	the LORD your God is giving them. ... that which
c21991	Then you may return to the land of your inheritance
c21992	and take possession of
c21993	Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the east side of the Jordan.”
c21994	So they answered Joshua,
c21996	“Everything
c21997	you have commanded
c21998	us we will do,
c21999	and everywhere
c22000	you send
c22001	us we will go.
c22002	in all things,
c22003	Just as ... Moses ... so we will obey you.
c22004	we obeyed
c22005	And may the LORD your God be with you,
c22006	as He was with Moses.
c22007	Anyone
c22008	who rebels against your order
c22009	and does not obey your words, all
c22010	that you command him,
c22011	will be put to death.
c22012	Above all, be strong
c22013	and courageous!”
c22014	Then Joshua son of Nun ... sent two ... from Acacia Grove,
c22015	secretly ... spies
c22016	saying,
c22017	“Go,
c22018	inspect the land, especially Jericho.”
c22019	So they went
c22020	and entered the house of a prostitute
c22021	named Rahab
c22022	and stayed there.
c22023	And it was reported to the king of Jericho:
c22025	“Behold,
c22026	some men of Israel have come here tonight
c22027	to spy out the land.”
c22028	So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab
c22029	and said,
c22030	“Bring out the men
c22031	who came to
c22032	you and entered your house,
c22033	for
c22034	to spy out the whole land.”
c22035	they have come
c22036	But the woman had taken the two men
c22037	and hidden them.
c22038	So she said,
c22039	“Yes, the men did come to me,
c22040	but I did not know
c22041	where they had come from.
c22042	was
c22043	when the gate
c22044	At dusk, ... about to close,
c22045	the men went out,
c22046	and I do not know
c22047	which way they went.
c22048	Pursue them quickly,
c22049	and you may catch them!”
c22050	(But [Rahab] had taken them up to the roof
c22051	and hidden them among the stalks of flax
c22052	that she had laid out [there].)
c22053	So the [king's] men set out in pursuit [of the spies] along the road to the fords of the Jordan,
c22054	the gate was shut.
c22055	and as soon as they
c22056	had gone out,
c22057	[the spies]
c22058	Before ... lay down for the night,
c22059	[Rahab] went up on the roof
c22060	and said to them,
c22061	“I know
c22062	that the LORD has given you this land
c22063	and that the fear of you has fallen on us,
c22064	so that all the inhabitants of the land are melting in fear of you.
c22065	For we have heard
c22066	how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you
c22067	when you came out of Egypt,
c22068	and what you did ... the two kings of the Amorites
c22069	across the Jordan, whom
c22070	to Sihon and Og,
c22071	you completely destroyed.
c22072	When we heard this,
c22073	our hearts melted
c22074	and everyone’s courage failed because of you,
c22075	for the LORD your God
c22076	is God in the heavens above and on the earth below.
c22077	Now therefore,
c22078	please swear to me by the LORD
c22079	show kindness to ... because
c22080	that you will indeed ... my family ... I showed kindness to you.
c22081	Give me a sure sign
c22082	that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all
c22083	who belong to them,
c22084	and that you will deliver us from death.”
c22085	the men agreed.
c22086	“Our lives for your
c22087	lives!”
c22088	“If you do not report our mission,
c22090	when the LORD gives us the land.”
c22091	we will show you kindness and faithfulness
c22092	Then [Rahab] let them down by a rope through the window,
c22093	since the house ... was built into the wall of the city.
c22094	where she lived
c22095	she said,
c22096	“Go to the hill country,”
c22097	“so that your pursuers will not find you.
c22098	Hide yourselves there for three days
c22099	until they have returned;
c22100	then go on your way.”
c22101	The men said to her,
c22102	“We will not be bound by this oath
c22103	you made us swear
c22104	unless, when we enter the land,
c22105	you have tied this scarlet cord in the window
c22106	through which you let us down,
c22107	and unless you have brought your father and mother and brothers and all your family into your house.
c22108	will be
c22109	If anyone
c22110	goes out the doors of your house into the street,
c22111	his blood ... on his own head,
c22112	and we will be innocent.
c22113	on anyone
c22114	with you in the house,
c22115	his blood will be on our heads.
c22116	But if a hand is laid
c22117	And if you report our mission,
c22118	we will be released from the oath
c22119	you made us swear.”
c22120	she replied,
c22121	be as you say,”
c22122	“Let it
c22123	and sent them away.
c22124	And when they had gone,
c22125	she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
c22127	So the [spies] went out into the hill country
c22128	and stayed there three days,
c22129	until their pursuers had returned
c22130	having searched all along the road.
c22131	without finding them,
c22132	Then the [two] men started back,
c22133	came down from the hill country
c22134	and crossed [the river].
c22135	So they came to Joshua son of Nun
c22136	and reported all
c22137	that had happened to them.
c22138	they said to Joshua.
c22139	“The LORD has surely delivered the entire land into our hands,”
c22140	“Indeed, all the inhabitants of the land are melting in fear of us.”
c22141	Early the next morning Joshua got up
c22142	and left Acacia Grove
c22143	with all the Israelites. They went as far as the Jordan,
c22144	where they camped
c22145	before crossing over.
c22146	After three days
c22147	the officers went through the camp
c22148	and commanded the people:
c22150	“When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God ... by the Levitical priests,
c22151	being carried
c22152	you are to set out from your positions
c22153	and follow it.
c22154	But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits between yourselves and the ark.
c22155	Do not go near it,
c22156	so that you can see the way
c22157	to go,
c22158	since you have never traveled this way before.”
c22159	Then Joshua told the people,
c22160	“Consecrate yourselves,
c22161	for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.”
c22162	And [he] said to the priests,
c22164	“Take the ark of the covenant
c22165	and go on ahead of the people.”
c22166	So they carried the ark of the covenant
c22167	and went ahead of them.
c22168	Now the LORD said to Joshua,
c22169	“Today I will begin
c22170	to exalt you in the sight of all Israel,
c22171	so they may know
c22172	that
c22173	I am with you, just as ... Moses.
c22174	I was with
c22175	Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant:
c22177	‘When you reach the edge of the waters,
c22178	stand in the Jordan.’”
c22179	So Joshua told the Israelites,
c22180	“Come here
c22181	and listen to the words of the LORD your God.”
c22182	He continued,
c22183	“This is how you will know
c22184	that the living God [is] among you
c22185	and that He will surely drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.
c22186	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go ahead of you into the Jordan.
c22187	Now
c22188	choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel,
c22189	one from each tribe.
c22191	When the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD— the Lord of all the earth— touch down in the waters of the Jordan,
c22192	its ... waters will be cut off
c22193	[and]
c22194	flowing
c22195	stand up in a heap.”
c22196	So
c22197	when the people broke camp
c22198	to cross the Jordan,
c22199	the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of [them].
c22200	Now the Jordan ... carrying the ark reached
c22201	But as soon as the priests ... [and] their feet touched the water's edge,
c22202	overflows its banks throughout the harvest season. ... the Jordan
c22203	water stood still.
c22204	the flowing
c22205	It backed up as far upstream as Adam, a city
c22206	in the area of Zarethan,
c22208	while the water flowing toward the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea)
c22209	was completely
c22210	cut off.
c22211	So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
c22212	The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan,
c22213	while all Israel crossed over the dry ground,
c22214	until the entire nation
c22215	had crossed the Jordan.
c22217	When the whole nation had finished
c22218	crossing the Jordan,
c22219	the LORD said to Joshua,
c22221	“Choose twelve ... from among the people,
c22222	men ... one from each tribe,
c22223	and command them:
c22225	‘Take up for yourselves ... from the middle of the Jordan where the priests
c22226	were standing,
c22227	twelve stones
c22228	carry them with you,
c22229	and set them down in the place
c22230	where you spend the night.’”
c22231	So Joshua summoned the twelve men
c22232	he had appointed
c22233	from the Israelites, one from [each] tribe,
c22234	and said to them,
c22235	“Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan.
c22236	of you is to take
c22237	Each ... a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of Israel,
c22238	to serve as a sign among you.
c22239	In the future, when your children ask,
c22241	‘What do these stones mean to you?’
c22242	you are to tell them,
c22243	‘The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
c22244	When it crossed the Jordan,
c22245	[its] waters were cut off.’
c22246	Therefore these stones will be a memorial to the Israelites forever.”
c22247	Thus the Israelites did
c22248	as Joshua had commanded them.
c22249	They took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan,
c22250	just as the LORD had told Joshua; ... to
c22251	one for each tribe of Israel,
c22252	and they carried them ... the camp,
c22253	where they set them down.
c22254	Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing.
c22255	And [the stones] are there to this day.
c22256	Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan
c22257	until ... had completed everything
c22258	the LORD had commanded Joshua
c22259	the people ... to tell them, just as
c22260	Moses had directed Joshua.
c22261	The people hurried
c22262	across,
c22264	and after everyone had finished
c22265	crossing,
c22266	the priests with the ark of the LORD crossed in the sight of the people.
c22267	The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over before the Israelites, armed for battle
c22268	as Moses had instructed them.
c22269	About 40,000 troops armed for battle crossed over before the LORD into the plains of Jericho.
c22270	On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel,
c22271	and they revered him
c22272	all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses.
c22273	Then the LORD said to Joshua,
c22275	“Command the priests who carry the ark of the Testimony
c22276	to come up from the Jordan.”
c22277	So Joshua commanded the priests,
c22279	“Come up from the Jordan.”
c22281	When the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up out of the Jordan
c22282	and their feet touched the dry land,
c22283	the waters of the Jordan returned to their course
c22284	and overflowed all the banks as before.
c22285	On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan
c22286	and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
c22287	And ... the twelve stones
c22288	they had taken from the Jordan.
c22289	there at Gilgal Joshua set up
c22290	Then [Joshua] said to the Israelites,
c22292	“In the future, when your children ask their fathers,
c22294	‘What is the meaning of these stones?’
c22295	you are to tell [them],
c22297	‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’
c22298	For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you
c22299	until you had crossed over,
c22300	just as [He] did to the Red Sea,
c22301	which He dried up before us
c22302	until we had crossed over.
c22303	{He did this] so that all the peoples of the earth may know ... the hand of the LORD
c22304	that ... is mighty,
c22305	and so that you may always fear the LORD your God.”
c22306	Now
c22307	when all the Amorite kings ... heard
c22308	west of the Jordan ... how
c22309	and all the Canaanite kings
c22310	along the coast
c22311	the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites
c22312	until they had crossed over,
c22313	their hearts melted
c22314	and their spirit failed for fear of the Israelites.
c22315	At that time the LORD said to Joshua,
c22316	“Make flint knives
c22317	once again.”
c22318	and circumcise the sons of Israel
c22319	So Joshua made flint knives
c22320	and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
c22321	Now this is why
c22322	Joshua circumcised them:
c22323	All those
c22324	who came out of Egypt—
c22326	all the men of war— had died on the journey in the wilderness
c22327	after they had left Egypt.
c22328	Though all ... were circumcised,
c22329	who had come out
c22330	none of those
c22331	born in the wilderness on the journey
c22332	from Egypt
c22333	had been circumcised.
c22334	For the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness forty years,
c22335	until all the nation’s men of war ... had died,
c22336	who had come out of Egypt
c22337	since they did not obey the LORD.
c22338	So the LORD vowed
c22339	never to let them see the land
c22340	He had sworn to their fathers
c22341	to give us,
c22342	a land flowing with milk and honey.
c22343	And ... raised up their sons in their place,
c22344	Joshua ... and these were the ones he circumcised.
c22345	[Until this time] they were still uncircumcised, since
c22346	they had not been circumcised on the way.
c22347	And
c22348	after all the nation
c22349	had been circumcised,
c22350	they stayed there in the camp
c22351	until they were healed.
c22352	Then the LORD said to Joshua,
c22353	“Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.”
c22354	So that place has been called Gilgal to this day.
c22355	while the Israelites were camped at Gilgal
c22356	On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, ... on the plains of Jericho, they kept the Passover.
c22357	The day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land.
c22358	And the day ... the manna ceased.
c22359	after they had eaten from the produce of the land,
c22360	There was no more manna for the Israelites,
c22361	so that year they began to eat the crops of the land of Canaan.
c22362	was
c22363	Now when Joshua ... near Jericho,
c22364	he looked up
c22365	and saw
c22366	a man standing in front of
c22367	him with a drawn sword in His hand.
c22368	Joshua approached Him
c22369	and asked,
c22370	“Are You
c22371	for us or for our enemies?”
c22372	He replied.
c22373	“Neither,”
c22374	“I ... as commander of the LORD’s army.”
c22375	have now come
c22376	Then Joshua fell facedown
c22377	in reverence
c22378	and asked Him,
c22379	“What does my Lord have to say to His servant?”
c22380	The commander of the LORD’s army replied,
c22381	“Take off your sandals,
c22382	for the place
c22383	where you are standing
c22384	is holy.”
c22385	And Joshua did so.
c22386	Now Jericho was tightly shut up
c22387	because of the Israelites—
c22388	no one went out
c22389	and no one came in.
c22390	And the LORD said to Joshua,
c22391	“Behold,
c22392	I have delivered Jericho and its king and fighting men into your hands.
c22393	March around the city
c22394	with all the men of war, circling the city one time.
c22395	Do this for six days.
c22396	Have seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark.
c22397	Then on the seventh day, march around the city seven times,
c22398	while the priests blow the trumpets.
c22399	And when
c22400	there is a long blast of the ram's horn
c22401	and you hear [its] sound,
c22402	have all the people give a mighty shout.
c22403	Then the wall of the city will collapse,
c22404	and the people will go up,
c22405	each man straight ahead.”
c22406	So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests
c22407	and said,
c22408	“Take up the ark of the covenant
c22409	and have seven priests carry seven trumpets in front of the ark of the LORD.”
c22410	And he told the people,
c22411	“Advance
c22412	and march around the city,
c22413	with the armed troops going ahead of the ark of the LORD.”
c22415	After Joshua had spoken to the people,
c22416	seven priests
c22417	carrying seven trumpets before the LORD
c22418	advanced
c22419	and blew the trumpets,
c22420	and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
c22421	While the trumpets continued to sound, the armed troops marched ahead of the priests
c22422	and the rear guard followed the ark.
c22424	who blew the trumpets,
c22425	But Joshua had commanded the people:
c22427	“Do not give a battle cry
c22428	or let your voice be heard; do not
c22429	let one word come out of your mouth until the day
c22430	I tell you
c22431	to shout.
c22432	Then you are to shout!”
c22433	So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city,
c22434	circling it once.
c22435	And [the people] returned to the camp
c22436	and spent the night there.
c22437	Joshua got up early the next morning,
c22438	and the priests took the ark of the LORD.
c22439	And the seven priests
c22440	carrying seven trumpets ... ahead of the ark of the LORD
c22441	kept marching
c22443	and sounding the trumpets.
c22444	The armed troops went in front of them,
c22445	and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD,
c22446	while [the priests] kept
c22447	sounding the trumpets.
c22448	So on the second day they marched around the city once
c22449	and returned to the camp.
c22450	They did this for six days.
c22451	Then on the seventh day,
c22452	they got up
c22453	at dawn
c22454	and marched around the city seven times in the same manner.
c22455	That was the only day they circled the city seven times.
c22456	After the seventh time around,
c22457	the priests blew the trumpets,
c22458	and Joshua commanded the people,
c22459	“Shout!
c22460	For the LORD has given you the city!
c22461	Now the city and everything ... must be devoted
c22462	in it
c22463	to the LORD.
c22464	Only Rahab the prostitute and all those ... will live,
c22465	with her in her house
c22466	because she hid the spies
c22467	we sent.
c22468	But keep away from the devoted things,
c22469	lest you yourself be set apart for destruction.
c22470	If you take any of [these],
c22471	you will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction
c22472	and bring disaster upon it.
c22473	For all the silver and gold and all the articles of bronze and iron
c22474	are holy to the LORD;
c22475	they must go into [His] treasury.”
c22476	the people shouted.
c22477	So when the trumpets sounded,
c22479	When they heard the blast of the trumpet,
c22480	the people gave a great shout,
c22481	and the wall collapsed.
c22482	The people charged into the city,
c22483	each man straight ahead,
c22484	and captured the city.
c22485	they utterly destroyed everything
c22486	in the city—
c22487	At the edge of the sword ... man and woman, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys.
c22488	the two men
c22489	who had spied out the land,
c22490	Meanwhile, Joshua told
c22491	“Go into the house of the prostitute ... the woman
c22492	and bring out ... and all
c22493	who are with her,
c22494	just as you promised her.”
c22495	So the young spies went in
c22496	and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers, and all
c22497	who belonged to her.
c22498	They brought out her whole family
c22499	and settled them outside the camp of Israel.
c22500	Then [the Israelites] burned up the city and everything in it.
c22502	However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD’s house.
c22503	And ... Rahab the prostitute, with her father’s household and all
c22504	who belonged to her,
c22505	Joshua spared
c22506	So she has lived among the Israelites to this day.
c22507	because she hid the men
c22508	Joshua had sent
c22509	to spy out Jericho.
c22510	At that time Joshua invoked this solemn oath:
c22512	“Cursed before the LORD is the man
c22513	who rises up
c22514	and rebuilds this city, Jericho;
c22515	at the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundations;
c22516	at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.”
c22517	So the LORD was with Joshua,
c22518	and his fame spread throughout the land.
c22519	The Israelites, however, acted unfaithfully regarding the devoted things.
c22520	Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of what was set apart.
c22521	So the LORD’s anger burned against the Israelites.
c22522	Meanwhile, Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai,
c22523	which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel,
c22524	and told them,
c22526	“Go up
c22527	and spy out the land.”
c22528	So the men went up
c22529	and spied out Ai.
c22530	On returning to Joshua,
c22531	they reported,
c22532	“There is no need to send all the people;
c22533	two or three thousand men [are enough] to go up
c22534	and attack Ai.
c22535	you need not wear out all our people there.”
c22536	Since the people of Ai are so few,
c22537	So about three thousand men went up,
c22538	but they were put to flight before the men of Ai.
c22539	And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of them
c22540	and chased them from the gate as far as the quarries,
c22541	striking them down on the slopes.
c22542	So the hearts of the people melted
c22543	and became like water.
c22544	Then Joshua tore his clothes
c22545	and fell facedown before the ark of the LORD until evening, as did the elders of Israel; ... on
c22546	and they all sprinkled dust ... their heads.
c22547	Joshua said,
c22548	“O, Lord GOD,”
c22549	“why did You ever bring these people across the Jordan
c22550	to hand us over to the Amorites
c22551	to be destroyed?
c22552	If only we had been content
c22553	to stay on the other side of the Jordan!
c22554	O Lord,
c22555	what can I say,
c22556	now that Israel has turned its back and run from its enemies?
c22557	When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this,
c22558	they will surround us
c22559	and wipe out our name from the earth.
c22560	Then what will You do for Your great name?”
c22561	But the LORD said to Joshua,
c22562	“Stand up!
c22563	Why have you fallen on your face?
c22564	Israel has sinned;
c22565	they have transgressed My covenant
c22566	that I commanded them,
c22567	and they have taken some of what was devoted.
c22568	Indeed, they have stolen
c22569	and lied about it,
c22570	and they have put [these things] with their own possessions.
c22571	This is why the Israelites cannot
c22572	stand against their enemies.
c22573	They will turn their backs and run from their enemies,
c22574	because they have been set apart for destruction.
c22575	I will no longer
c22576	be with
c22577	you unless you remove from among you whatever is devoted to destruction.
c22578	Get up
c22579	and consecrate the people,
c22580	saying,
c22581	‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow,
c22582	for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c22583	That which is devoted is among you,
c22584	O Israel.
c22585	You cannot
c22586	stand against your enemies
c22587	until you remove [it].
c22588	In the morning you must present yourselves tribe by tribe.
c22589	The tribe
c22590	that the LORD selects
c22591	shall come forward clan by clan,
c22592	and the clan
c22593	that the LORD selects
c22594	shall come forward family by family,
c22595	and the family
c22596	that the LORD selects
c22597	shall come forward man by man.
c22599	The one who is caught with the devoted things
c22600	must be burned,
c22601	along with all that belongs to him,
c22603	because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD
c22604	[and] committed an outrage in Israel.”
c22605	So Joshua arose early the next morning
c22606	and had Israel come forward tribe by tribe,
c22607	and the tribe of Judah was selected.
c22608	He had the clans of Judah come forward,
c22609	and the clan of the Zerahites was selected.
c22610	He had the Zerahite clan come forward by families,
c22611	and Zabdi was selected.
c22612	And he had Zabdi’s family come forward man by man,
c22613	and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.
c22614	So Joshua said to Achan,
c22615	“My son,
c22616	give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, ... I urge you
c22617	and make a confession to Him.
c22618	to tell me
c22619	what you have done;
c22620	do not hide [it] from me.”
c22621	Achan replied,
c22623	“It is true,” ... “I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel.
c22624	This is what I did:
c22625	When I saw among the spoils a beautiful cloak from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold
c22626	weighing fifty shekels,
c22627	I coveted
c22628	them and took them.
c22629	They are hidden in the ground inside my tent,
c22630	with the silver underneath.”
c22631	So Joshua sent messengers
c22632	who ran to the tent,
c22633	and there was [the cloak], hidden in his tent,
c22634	with the silver underneath.
c22635	They took the things from inside the tent,
c22636	brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites,
c22637	and spread them out before the LORD.
c22638	Then Joshua, ... took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the cloak, and the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen, donkeys, and sheep, his tent, and everything [else]
c22639	he owned,
c22640	together with all Israel,
c22641	and brought them to the Valley of Achor.
c22642	said Joshua.
c22643	“Why have you brought this trouble upon us?”
c22644	“Today the LORD will bring trouble upon you!”
c22645	And all Israel stoned him to death.
c22646	and burned their bodies.
c22647	Then they stoned [the others]
c22648	And they heaped over [Achan] a large pile of rocks that remains to this day.
c22649	So the LORD turned from His burning anger.
c22650	Therefore that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day.
c22651	Then the LORD said to Joshua,
c22652	“Do not be afraid
c22653	or discouraged.
c22654	Take the whole army with you,
c22655	and go up
c22656	and attack Ai.
c22657	See,
c22658	I have handed over to you the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.
c22659	And you shall do to Ai and its king
c22660	as you did to Jericho and its king,
c22661	except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves.
c22662	Set
c22663	an ambush ... the city.”
c22664	behind
c22665	So Joshua and the whole army set out
c22666	to attack Ai.
c22667	Joshua chose 30,000 valiant warriors
c22668	and sent them out at night
c22669	with these orders:
c22671	“Pay attention.
c22672	You are to lie in ambush ... the city, ... from it.
c22673	behind ... not too far
c22674	All of you must be ready.
c22675	Then I and all the troops
c22676	with me
c22677	will advance on the city.
c22679	When they come out
c22680	against us
c22681	as they did the first time,
c22682	we will flee from them.
c22683	They will pursue
c22684	us until we have drawn them away from the city,
c22685	for they will say,
c22686	‘[The Israelites] are running away from us
c22687	as they did before.’
c22688	So as we flee from them,
c22689	you are to rise from the ambush
c22690	and seize the city,
c22691	for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hands.
c22693	After you have taken the city,
c22694	set it on fire.
c22695	Do as the LORD has commanded!
c22696	See,
c22697	I have given you orders.”
c22698	So Joshua sent them out,
c22699	and they went to the place of ambush
c22700	and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai.
c22701	But [Joshua] spent that night among the people.
c22702	Joshua rose early the next morning
c22703	and mobilized [his men],
c22704	and he and the elders of Israel marched before [them] up to Ai.
c22705	Then all the troops
c22706	who [were] with him
c22707	marched up
c22708	and approached
c22709	the city. They arrived in front [of Ai]
c22710	and camped to the north of it,
c22711	with the valley between them and the city.
c22712	Now Joshua had taken about five thousand men
c22713	and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
c22714	So the forces were stationed with the main camp
c22715	to the north of the city
c22716	and the rear guard to the west of the city.
c22717	And that night Joshua went into the valley.
c22719	When the king of Ai saw [the Israelites],
c22720	he hurried
c22721	early in the morning
c22722	out ... with the men of the city
c22723	to engage [them] in battle
c22724	at an appointed place overlooking the Arabah.
c22725	But he did not know
c22726	that an ambush had been set against him behind the city.
c22727	Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten back before them,
c22728	and they fled toward the wilderness.
c22729	Then all the men [of Ai] were summoned
c22730	the city.
c22731	to pursue them,
c22732	and they followed Joshua
c22733	and were drawn away from
c22734	Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel
c22735	who did not go out after Israel,
c22736	leaving the city wide open
c22737	while they pursued Israel.
c22738	Then the LORD said to Joshua,
c22739	“Hold out your battle lance
c22741	toward Ai,
c22742	for into your hand I will deliver [the city].”
c22743	So Joshua held out his battle lance
c22745	toward [Ai],
c22746	the men in ambush rose quickly from their position.
c22747	They rushed forward,
c22748	and as soon as he did so,
c22749	entered the city,
c22750	captured it,
c22751	and immediately
c22752	set it on fire.
c22753	When the men of Ai turned ... back,
c22754	and looked
c22755	the smoke of the city was rising to the sky.
c22756	They could not
c22757	escape in any direction,
c22758	and the troops
c22759	who had fled to the wilderness
c22760	now became the pursuers.
c22761	When Joshua and all Israel saw
c22762	that the men in ambush had captured the city
c22763	and that smoke was rising from [it],
c22764	they turned around
c22765	and struck down the men of Ai.
c22766	Meanwhile, those in the ambush came out of the city
c22767	against them,
c22768	and the men of Ai were trapped between the Israelite
c22769	forces on
c22770	both sides.
c22771	So [Israel] struck them down
c22772	until no survivor or fugitive remained.
c22773	But they took the king of Ai alive
c22774	and brought him to Joshua.
c22776	When Israel had finished
c22777	killing all the men of Ai ... into the field and wilderness,
c22778	who had pursued them
c22779	and when every last one of them had fallen by the sword,
c22781	all the Israelites returned to Ai
c22782	and struck it down with the sword.
c22783	A total
c22784	fell that day—
c22785	of twelve thousand men and women ... all the people of Ai.
c22786	Joshua did not draw back his hand
c22787	that held his battle lance
c22788	until all the inhabitants of Ai were completely destroyed.
c22789	Israel took for themselves only the cattle and plunder of that city, as the LORD
c22790	had commanded Joshua.
c22791	So Joshua burned Ai
c22792	and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolation to this day.
c22793	He hung the body of the king of Ai on a tree until evening,
c22795	and at sunset
c22796	Joshua commanded
c22797	that they take down the body from the tree
c22798	and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate.
c22799	And over it they raised a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day.
c22800	At that time Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal to the LORD, the God of Israel,
c22801	just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites.
c22802	He built it according to what is written in the book of the Law of Moses:
c22803	an altar of uncut stones
c22804	on which no iron tool had been used.
c22805	And on it they offered burnt offerings to the LORD,
c22806	and they sacrificed peace offerings.
c22807	And there ... [Joshua] inscribed on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses,
c22808	in the presence of the Israelites, ... which he had written.
c22809	All Israel, foreigners and citizens alike, with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD facing the Levitical priests who carried [it].
c22810	Half [of the people stood] in front of Mount Gerizim
c22811	and half of them in front of Mount Ebal,
c22812	as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded
c22813	to bless the people of Israel.
c22814	earlier
c22815	Afterward, Joshua read aloud all the words of the law— the blessings and the curses— according to all
c22816	that is written in the book of the law.
c22817	There was not a word of all
c22818	that Moses had commanded
c22819	that Joshua failed to read before the whole assembly of Israel, including the women, the little ones, and the foreigners
c22820	who lived among them.
c22821	Now when
c22822	news of this reached all the kings
c22823	west of the Jordan— those in the hill country, the foothills, and all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon
c22824	(the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)—
c22825	they came together
c22826	to wage war against Joshua and Israel.
c22827	But the people of Gibeon, having heard
c22828	what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
c22829	acted deceptively
c22830	and set out
c22831	as envoys,
c22832	carrying on their donkeys worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended.
c22833	They put worn, patched sandals on their feet
c22834	and threadbare clothing on [their bodies],
c22835	and their whole supply of bread was dry
c22836	[and] moldy.
c22837	They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal
c22838	and said to him and the men of Israel,
c22839	“We have come from a distant land;
c22840	please make a treaty with us.”
c22841	But the men of Israel said to the Hivites,
c22842	“Perhaps you dwell near us.
c22843	How can we make a treaty with you?”
c22844	they said to Joshua.
c22845	“We are your servants,”
c22846	Then Joshua asked them,
c22847	“Who are you
c22848	and from where have you come?”
c22849	they replied,
c22850	“Your servants have come from a very distant land,” ... “because of the fame of the LORD your God.
c22851	For we have heard the reports of Him
c22852	and all
c22853	that He did in Egypt,
c22854	as well as all
c22855	that He did to the two kings of the Amorites
c22856	beyond the Jordan— ... who
c22857	Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan,
c22858	reigned in Ashtaroth.
c22859	So the elders and inhabitants of our land told us,
c22861	‘Take provisions for your journey;
c22862	go
c22863	to meet them
c22864	and say to them:
c22865	We are your servants.
c22866	Please make a treaty with us.’
c22867	This bread
c22868	of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day
c22869	we left
c22870	to come to you.
c22871	But take a look, it is now dry
c22872	and moldy.
c22873	These wineskins
c22874	when we filled them,
c22875	were new
c22876	but look, they are cracked.
c22877	And these clothes and sandals
c22878	are worn out from our very long journey.”
c22879	Then the men of Israel sampled their provisions,
c22880	but did not seek the counsel of the LORD.
c22881	And Joshua made ... of peace with them
c22882	a treaty
c22883	to let them live,
c22884	and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.
c22885	Three days
c22886	after they had made the treaty with [the Gibeonites],
c22887	[the Israelites learned
c22888	that they [were] neighbors,
c22889	living among them.
c22890	So the Israelites set out
c22891	and on the third day arrived at their cities—
c22892	Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
c22893	But the Israelites did not attack them,
c22894	because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel.
c22895	And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders.
c22896	All the leaders answered,
c22897	“We have sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel,
c22898	and now we cannot
c22899	touch them.
c22900	This is how we will treat them:
c22901	We will let them live,
c22902	so that no wrath will fall on us because of the oath
c22903	we swore to them.”
c22904	They continued,
c22905	“Let them live,
c22906	but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the whole congregation.”
c22907	So the leaders kept their promise.
c22908	Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites
c22909	and said,
c22910	by telling
c22911	“Why did you deceive us
c22913	us you live far away from us,
c22914	when in fact you live among us?
c22915	Now therefore you are under a curse
c22916	and will perpetually serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
c22917	The Gibeonites answered,
c22919	“Your servants were told clearly
c22920	that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses
c22921	to give you all the land
c22922	and wipe out all its inhabitants before you.
c22923	So we greatly feared for our lives because of you,
c22924	and that is why we have done this.
c22925	Now we are in your hands.
c22926	as it seems good and right [to you].”
c22927	to us
c22928	Do
c22929	So Joshua did this
c22930	and delivered them from the hands of the Israelites,
c22931	and they did not kill [the Gibeonites].
c22932	On that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers, as they are to this day, for the congregation of the LORD and for the altar at the place
c22933	He would choose.
c22934	Now
c22935	Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard
c22936	that Joshua had captured Ai
c22937	and completely destroyed it,
c22938	doing to ... and its king as ... Jericho
c22939	Ai ... he had done to ... and its king,
c22940	and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel
c22941	and were living among them.
c22942	So [Adoni-zedek and his people] were greatly alarmed,
c22943	because Gibeon [was] a great city, like one of the royal cities;
c22944	it was larger than Ai,
c22945	and all its men were warriors.
c22946	Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon,
c22947	saying,
c22948	“Come up
c22949	and help me.
c22950	We will attack Gibeon,
c22951	because they have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”
c22952	joined forces
c22953	So the five kings of the Amorites— the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon— ... and advanced with all their armies.
c22954	They camped before Gibeon
c22955	and made war against it.
c22956	Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal:
c22958	“Do not abandon your servants.
c22959	Come quickly ... against us.”
c22960	and save us!
c22961	Help us,
c22962	because all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country have joined forces
c22963	So Joshua and his whole army, including all the mighty warriors, came from Gilgal.
c22964	The LORD said to Joshua,
c22965	“Do not be afraid of them,
c22966	for I have given them into your hands.
c22967	Not one of them shall stand against you.”
c22968	Joshua caught them by surprise.
c22969	After marching all night from Gilgal,
c22970	The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel,
c22971	who defeated them in a great slaughter at Gibeon,
c22972	pursued them through the ascent to Beth-horon,
c22973	and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
c22975	As they fled before Israel
c22976	along the descent from Beth-horon
c22977	to Azekah, the LORD cast down on them large hailstones from the sky,
c22979	and more
c22980	of them were killed by the hailstones
c22981	than by the swords of the Israelites.
c22982	On the day the LORD ... Joshua spoke
c22983	gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, ... to the LORD
c22984	in the presence of Israel:
c22985	“O sun,
c22986	stand still over Gibeon,
c22988	O moon,
c22989	over the Valley of Aijalon.”
c22990	So the sun stood still
c22991	and the moon stopped
c22992	until the nation took vengeance upon its enemies.
c22993	Is this not written in the Book of Jashar?
c22994	“So the sun stopped in the middle of the sky
c22995	and delayed
c22996	going down almost a full day.”
c22997	There has been no day like it before or since,
c22998	when the LORD listened to the voice of a man,
c22999	because the LORD fought for Israel.
c23000	Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
c23001	Now the five kings had fled
c23002	and hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
c23003	And Joshua was informed:
c23005	“The five kings have been found;
c23006	they are hiding in the cave at Makkedah.”
c23007	So Joshua said,
c23008	“Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave,
c23009	and post men there
c23010	to guard them.
c23011	But you, do not stop there.
c23012	Pursue your enemies
c23013	and attack them from behind.
c23014	Do not let them
c23015	reach their cities,
c23016	for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.”
c23018	So Joshua and the Israelites finished
c23019	inflicting a terrible slaughter
c23020	until they had finished them off,
c23021	and the remaining survivors
c23022	retreated to the fortified cities.
c23023	The whole army returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah;
c23024	no one dared to utter a word against the Israelites.
c23025	Then Joshua said,
c23026	“Open the mouth of the cave,
c23027	and bring those five kings out to me.”
c23028	So [they]
c23029	brought the five kings out of the cave— the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.
c23031	When they had brought the kings to Joshua,
c23032	[he] summoned all the men of Israel ... to
c23033	and said ... the army commanders
c23034	who had accompanied him,
c23035	“Come
c23036	here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.”
c23037	So the commanders came forward
c23038	and put their feet on their necks.
c23039	Joshua said.
c23040	“Do not be afraid
c23041	or discouraged,”
c23042	“Be strong
c23043	and courageous,
c23044	for the LORD will do this to all the enemies
c23045	you fight.”
c23046	After this, Joshua struck down
c23047	and killed [the kings],
c23048	and he hung their bodies on five trees
c23049	and left them
c23050	there
c23051	until evening.
c23053	At sunset
c23054	Joshua ordered
c23055	that they be taken down from the trees
c23056	and thrown into the cave
c23057	in which they had hidden.
c23058	Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave, and the stones are there to this day.
c23059	On that day Joshua captured Makkedah
c23060	and struck it down with the sword,
c23061	along with its king. He completely destroyed it and everyone in it,
c23062	as
c23063	leaving no survivors.
c23064	So he did to the king of Makkedah
c23065	he had done to the king of Jericho.
c23066	Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah
c23067	and fought against Libnah.
c23068	And the LORD also delivered [that city] and its king into the hands of Israel, and
c23069	[Joshua] struck down ... with the sword,
c23070	all the people
c23071	as
c23072	leaving no survivors.
c23073	And he did to the king [of Libnah]
c23074	he had done to the king of Jericho.
c23075	And Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish.
c23076	They laid siege to it
c23077	and fought against it.
c23078	And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel,
c23079	and Joshua captured it on the second day.
c23080	He struck down ... with the sword,
c23081	all the people
c23083	just as
c23084	he had done to Libnah.
c23085	At that time Horam king of Gezer went
c23086	to help Lachish,
c23087	but Joshua struck him down
c23088	along with his people,
c23089	leaving no survivors.
c23090	So Joshua moved on from Lachish to Eglon, and all Israel with him.
c23091	They laid siege to it
c23092	and fought against it.
c23093	That same day they captured [Eglon]
c23094	and struck down ... with the sword.
c23095	all the people
c23097	[Joshua] completely destroyed it that day, just as
c23098	he had done to Lachish.
c23099	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron
c23100	and fought against it.
c23101	They captured it
c23102	and struck down with the sword
c23103	its king, all its villages, and all the people.
c23105	[Joshua] left no survivors, just as
c23106	he had done at Eglon;
c23107	he completely destroyed [Hebron] and everyone
c23108	in it.
c23109	Finally Joshua and all Israel with him turned toward Debir
c23110	and fought against it.
c23111	And they captured [the city]
c23112	and its king and all its villages.
c23113	They struck them down with the sword
c23114	and completely destroyed all the people,
c23116	leaving no survivors.
c23117	[Joshua] did to ... to Hebron
c23118	Debir and its king ... he had done ... and as
c23119	as ... he had done to Libnah and its king.
c23120	So Joshua conquered the whole region— the hill country, the Negev, the foothills, and the slopes, together with all their kings—
c23121	leaving no survivors.
c23122	He completely destroyed all that breathed,
c23123	just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.
c23124	Joshua conquered the area from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza,
c23125	and the whole region of Goshen as far as Gibeon.
c23126	Joshua captured all these kings and their land in one campaign.
c23127	And because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel,
c23128	Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
c23129	Now when
c23130	Jabin king of Hazor heard of this,
c23131	he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph,
c23132	to the kings
c23133	of the north in the mountains,
c23134	in the Arabah south of Chinnereth,
c23135	in the foothills,
c23136	and on the slopes of Dor to the west,
c23137	to the Canaanites in the east and west,
c23138	to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the hill country,
c23139	and to the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
c23140	So [these kings] came out with all their armies, a multitude as numerous as the sand
c23141	on the seashore,
c23143	along with a great number of horses and chariots.
c23144	All these kings joined forces
c23146	and encamped at the waters of Merom
c23147	to fight against Israel.
c23148	The LORD said to Joshua,
c23149	“Do not be afraid of them,
c23150	for by this time tomorrow I will deliver all of them slain before Israel.
c23151	You shall hamstring their horses
c23152	and burn up their chariots.”
c23153	So by the waters of Merom Joshua and his whole army came upon them suddenly
c23154	and attacked them,
c23155	and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel,
c23156	who struck them down
c23157	and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh.
c23158	They struck them down,
c23159	leaving no survivors.
c23160	Joshua treated
c23161	them as the LORD had told him;
c23162	he hamstrung their horses
c23163	and burned up their chariots.
c23164	At that time Joshua turned back
c23165	and captured Hazor
c23166	and struck down its king with the sword,
c23167	because Hazor
c23168	was formerly the head of all these kingdoms.
c23169	[The Israelites] struck down everyone
c23170	in [Hazor]
c23171	with the sword,
c23172	utterly destroying [them].
c23173	Nothing that breathed remained,
c23174	and [Joshua] burned down Hazor itself.
c23175	Joshua captured all these kings and their cities
c23176	and struck them down with the sword.
c23177	He utterly destroyed them,
c23178	as Moses the LORD’s servant had commanded.
c23179	Yet ... any of the cities
c23180	built on their mounds,
c23181	Israel did not burn
c23182	except Hazor, which Joshua burned.
c23183	The Israelites took for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities,
c23184	but they struck down all the people with the sword
c23185	until they had completely destroyed them,
c23186	not sparing anyone who breathed.
c23187	As the LORD had commanded His servant Moses,
c23188	so Moses commanded Joshua. That is what
c23189	Joshua did,
c23190	leaving nothing undone of all
c23191	that the LORD had commanded Moses.
c23192	So Joshua took this entire region: the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah, and the mountains of Israel and their foothills,
c23193	from Mount Halak,
c23194	which rises toward Seir,
c23195	as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon.
c23196	He captured all their kings
c23197	and struck them down,
c23198	putting them to death.
c23199	Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long period of time.
c23200	No city
c23201	made peace with the Israelites
c23202	except the Hivites living in Gibeon;
c23203	all others were taken in battle.
c23204	For it was of the LORD
c23205	to harden their hearts
c23206	to engage Israel in battle,
c23207	that they would be completely destroyed
c23208	without mercy
c23209	and be annihilated
c23210	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c23211	At that time Joshua proceeded
c23212	to eliminate the Anakim from the hill country of Hebron, Debir, [and] Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah and of Israel.
c23213	Joshua completely destroyed them with their cities.
c23214	No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites;
c23215	only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did any survive.
c23216	So Joshua took the entire land, in keeping with all
c23217	that the LORD had spoken to Moses.
c23218	And Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to the allotments to their tribes.
c23219	Then the land had rest from war.
c23220	Now these [are] the kings of the land
c23221	whom the Israelites struck down and whose
c23222	lands they took beyond the Jordan to the east, from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon, including all the Arabah eastward:
c23223	Sihon king of the Amorites,
c23224	who lived in Heshbon.
c23225	He ruled from Aroer
c23226	on the rim of the Arnon Valley,
c23227	along the middle of the valley, up to the Jabbok River (the border of the Ammonites), that is, half of Gilead,
c23228	as well as the Arabah east of the Sea of Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Salt Sea), eastward through Beth-jeshimoth and southward below the slopes of Pisgah.
c23229	Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim,
c23230	who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
c23231	He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, all of Bashan up to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
c23232	Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the Israelites had struck them down
c23233	[and] given their land as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
c23234	And these [are] the kings of the land
c23235	that Joshua and the Israelites conquered beyond the Jordan to the west, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak,
c23236	which rises toward Seir.
c23237	(Joshua gave their land as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel according to their allotments—
c23238	the hill country, the foothills, the Arabah, the slopes, the wilderness, and the Negev— [the lands of] the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites):
c23239	the king of Jericho, one;
c23240	the king of Ai,
c23241	which [is] near Bethel,
c23242	one;
c23243	the king of Jerusalem, one;
c23244	the king of Hebron, one;
c23245	the king of Jarmuth, one;
c23246	the king of Lachish, one;
c23247	the king of Eglon, one;
c23248	the king of Gezer, one;
c23249	the king of Debir, one;
c23250	the king of Geder, one;
c23251	the king of Hormah, one;
c23252	the king of Arad, one;
c23253	the king of Libnah, one;
c23254	the king of Adullam, one;
c23255	the king of Makkedah, one;
c23256	the king of Bethel, one;
c23257	the king of Tappuah, one;
c23258	the king of Hepher, one;
c23259	the king of Aphek, one;
c23260	the king of Lasharon, one;
c23261	the king of Madon, one;
c23262	the king of Hazor, one;
c23263	the king of Shimron-meron, one;
c23264	the king of Achshaph, one;
c23265	the king of Taanach, one;
c23266	the king of Megiddo, one;
c23267	the king of Kedesh, one;
c23268	the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
c23269	the king of Dor in Naphath-dor, one;
c23270	the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;
c23271	the king of Tirzah, one.
c23272	[So there were] thirty-one kings in all.
c23273	Now Joshua was old
c23274	[and] advanced in years,
c23275	and the LORD said to him,
c23276	“You have become old
c23277	[and] advanced in years,
c23278	but very much of the land remains
c23279	to be possessed.
c23280	This is the land
c23281	that remains:
c23282	All the territory of the Philistines and the Geshurites,
c23283	from the Shihor
c23284	east of Egypt
c23285	to the territory of Ekron on the north (considered to be Canaanite [territory])— that of the five Philistine rulers of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, as well as the Avvites;
c23286	to the south, all the land of the Canaanites, from Mearah
c23287	of the Sidonians
c23288	to Aphek, as far as the border of the Amorites;
c23289	the land of the Gebalites; and all Lebanon east from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon
c23290	to Lebo-hamath.
c23291	All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim— all the Sidonians—
c23292	I Myself will drive out before the Israelites.
c23293	Be sure to divide it by lot as an inheritance to Israel,
c23294	as I have commanded you.
c23295	Now therefore divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”
c23296	The other [half of Manasseh], along with the Reubenites and Gadites, had received the inheritance
c23297	Moses had given them ... just as
c23298	beyond the Jordan to the east,
c23299	Moses the servant of the LORD had assigned to them:
c23300	[The area] from Aroer
c23301	on the rim of the Arnon Valley,
c23302	along with the city
c23303	in the middle of the valley,
c23304	the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon,
c23305	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites
c23306	who reigned in Heshbon,
c23307	as far as the border of the Ammonites;
c23308	also Gilead and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, all of Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah—
c23309	the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan,
c23310	who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei
c23311	and had remained as a remnant of the Rephaim.
c23312	Moses struck them down
c23313	and dispossessed them,
c23314	but the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites.
c23315	So Geshur and Maacath dwell among the Israelites to this day.
c23316	To the tribe of Levi, however, [Moses] had given no inheritance.
c23317	The offerings made by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel,
c23318	are their inheritance,
c23319	as He promised them.
c23320	[This is what] Moses had given to the clans of the tribe of Reuben:
c23321	The territory from Aroer
c23322	on the rim of the Arnon Valley,
c23323	along with the city
c23324	in the middle of the valley,
c23325	to the whole plateau beyond Medeba,
c23326	with Heshbon and all its cities
c23327	on the plateau—
c23328	Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon,
c23329	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
c23330	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill in the valley,
c23331	Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth—
c23332	all the cities of the plateau and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,
c23333	who reigned in Heshbon
c23334	[until] Moses killed him and the chiefs of Midian— Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba— the princes of Sihon who lived in the land.
c23335	The Israelites also killed the diviner Balaam son of Beor [along with the others] they put to the sword.
c23336	And the border of the Reubenites was the bank of the Jordan.
c23337	This was the inheritance of the clans of the Reubenites, including the cities and villages.
c23338	[This is what] Moses had given to the clans of the tribe of Gad:
c23339	The territory of Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer,
c23340	near Rabbah;
c23341	from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim,
c23342	and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;
c23343	and in the valley, Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, with the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon (the territory on the east side of the Jordan up to the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth).
c23344	This was the inheritance of the clans of the Gadites, including the cities and villages.
c23345	[This is what] Moses had given ... of the half-tribe of Manasseh,
c23346	to the clans ... that is, to half the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh:
c23347	The territory from Mahanaim through all Bashan— all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, including all the towns of Jair
c23348	that are in Bashan,
c23349	sixty cities,
c23350	half of Gilead, also Ashtaroth and Edrei the royal cities of Og in Bashan. ... of the descendants of Machir son of Manasseh,
c23351	[All this was] for the clans ... that is, half the descendants of Machir.
c23352	These
c23353	{were the portions} Moses had given them on the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho.
c23354	To the tribe of Levi, however, [Moses] had given no inheritance.
c23355	The LORD, the God of Israel,
c23356	is their inheritance,
c23357	just as He had promised them.
c23358	Now these [are the portions]
c23359	that the Israelites inherited in the land of Canaan,
c23360	as distributed by Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes of Israel.
c23361	Their inheritance was assigned by lot
c23362	as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
c23363	for the nine and a half tribes,
c23364	For Moses had given the inheritance east of the Jordan to the [other] two and a half tribes.
c23365	But he granted no inheritance among them to the Levites.
c23366	The descendants of Joseph became two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim.
c23367	And no portion of the land was given to the Levites,
c23368	except for cities
c23369	in which to live,
c23370	along with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.
c23371	as the LORD had commanded Moses,
c23372	So the Israelites did
c23373	and they divided the land.
c23374	Then the sons of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, ... to him,
c23375	and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said
c23376	“You know
c23377	what the LORD said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh-barnea about you and me.
c23378	I [was] forty years old
c23379	when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea
c23380	to spy out the land,
c23381	and I brought back to him ... report.
c23382	an honest
c23383	Although my brothers
c23384	who went with me
c23385	{made} the hearts of the people melt with fear,
c23386	I remained loyal to the LORD my God.
c23387	On that day Moses swore to me,
c23388	saying,
c23389	‘Surely the land
c23390	on which you have set foot
c23391	will be an inheritance to you
c23392	and your children forever,
c23393	because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.’
c23394	Now
c23395	behold, ... [He] has kept me alive
c23396	as [the LORD] promised,
c23397	these forty-five years
c23398	since [He] spoke this word to Moses,
c23399	while Israel wandered in the wilderness.
c23400	So
c23401	here I am today, eighty-five years old,
c23402	still as strong today
c23403	as I was the day
c23404	Moses sent me out.
c23405	As my strength was then,
c23406	so [it] is now for war,
c23407	for going out,
c23408	and for coming in.
c23409	Now therefore
c23410	give me this hill country
c23411	that the LORD promised me on that day,
c23412	for you yourself heard then
c23413	that the Anakim were there,
c23414	with great [and] fortified cities.
c23415	Perhaps with the LORD's help
c23416	I will drive them out,
c23417	as the LORD has spoken.”
c23418	Then Joshua blessed
c23419	Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.
c23420	Therefore Hebron belongs to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite as an inheritance to this day,
c23421	because he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel.
c23422	(Hebron used to be called Kiriath-arba,
c23423	after Arba, the greatest man among the Anakim.)
c23424	Then the land had rest from war.
c23425	Now the allotment for the clans of the tribe of Judah extended to the border of Edom, to the Wilderness of Zin at the extreme southern boundary:
c23426	Their southern border started at the bay on ... tip of the Salt Sea,
c23427	the southern
c23428	proceeded to the south of the Ascent of Akrabbim,
c23429	continued on to Zin,
c23430	went over to the south of Kadesh-barnea,
c23431	ran past Hezron
c23432	up to Addar,
c23433	and curved toward Karka.
c23434	It proceeded to Azmon,
c23435	joined the Brook of Egypt,
c23436	and ended at the Sea.
c23437	This was their southern border.
c23438	The eastern border was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan.
c23439	The northern border [started] from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan,
c23440	went up to Beth-hoglah,
c23441	proceeded north of Beth-arabah,
c23442	and went up to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
c23443	Then [the border] went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor,
c23444	turning north to Gilgal,
c23445	which faces the Ascent of Adummim
c23446	south of the ravine.
c23447	[It] continued along the waters of En-shemesh
c23448	and came out at En-rogel.
c23449	From there the border went up the Valley of Hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusites
c23450	(that is, Jerusalem)
c23451	and ascended to the top of the hill
c23452	that faces the Valley of Hinnom on the west,
c23453	at the northern end of the Valley of the Rephaim.
c23454	From the hilltop the border curved to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah,
c23455	proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron,
c23456	and then bent around toward Baalah
c23457	(that is, Kiriath-jearim).
c23458	The border curled westward from Baalah to Mount Seir,
c23459	ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim
c23460	(that is, Chesalon),
c23461	went down to Beth-shemesh,
c23462	and crossed to Timnah.
c23463	Then [it] went out to the northern slope of Ekron,
c23464	curved toward Shikkeron,
c23465	proceeded to Mount Baalah,
c23466	went on to Jabneel,
c23467	and ended at the Sea.
c23468	And the western border ... of the Great Sea.
c23469	was the coastline
c23470	These are the boundaries around the clans of the descendants of Judah.
c23471	According to the LORD’s command to [him], [Joshua] gave Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah— Kiriath-arba, ... (Arba was the forefather of Anak.)
c23472	that [is], Hebron.
c23473	And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak— the descendants of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
c23474	From there he marched against the inhabitants of Debir
c23475	(formerly known as Kiriath-sepher).
c23476	And Caleb said,
c23477	to the one who strikes down ... Kiriath-sepher.”
c23478	and captures
c23479	“I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage
c23480	So Othniel son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz took it,
c23481	and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
c23482	Later,
c23483	[Acsah] came [to Othniel]
c23484	and urged him
c23485	to ask her father for a field.
c23486	When she got off her donkey,
c23487	Caleb asked her,
c23488	“What would you like?”
c23489	she replied.
c23490	“Give me a blessing,”
c23491	“Since you have given me land in the Negev,
c23492	give me also springs of water.”
c23493	So [Caleb] gave her the upper and lower springs.
c23494	This is the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Judah.
c23495	These were the southernmost cities of the tribe of Judah in the Negev toward the border of Edom: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
c23496	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
c23497	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
c23498	Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
c23499	Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron
c23500	(that is, Hazor),
c23501	Amam, Shema, Moladah,
c23502	Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet,
c23503	Hazar-shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah,
c23504	Baalah, Iim, Ezem,
c23505	Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah,
c23506	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
c23507	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon—
c23508	twenty-nine cities in all, along with their villages.
c23509	[These were] in the foothills: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,
c23510	Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam,
c23511	Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,
c23512	Shaaraim, Adithaim, and Gederah (or Gederothaim)— fourteen cities, along with their villages.
c23513	Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad,
c23514	Dilan, Mizpeh, Joktheel,
c23515	Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,
c23516	Cabbon, Lahmas, Chitlish,
c23517	Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah— sixteen cities, along with their villages.
c23518	Libnah, Ether, Ashan,
c23519	Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
c23520	Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah— nine cities, along with their villages.
c23521	Ekron, with its towns and villages;
c23522	from Ekron to the sea, all
c23523	the cities near Ashdod, along with their villages;
c23524	Ashdod, with its towns and villages;
c23525	Gaza, with its towns and villages, as far as the Brook of Egypt and the coastline of the Great Sea.
c23526	[These were] in the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
c23527	Dannah, Kiriath-sannah
c23528	(that is, Debir),
c23529	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
c23530	Goshen, Holon, and Giloh— eleven cities, along with their villages.
c23531	Arab, Dumah, Eshan,
c23532	Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah,
c23533	Humtah, Kiriath-arba
c23534	(that is, Hebron),
c23535	and Zior— nine cities, along with their villages.
c23536	Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,
c23537	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,
c23538	Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah— ten cities, along with their villages.
c23539	Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor,
c23540	Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon— six cities, along with their villages.
c23541	Kiriath-baal
c23542	(that is, Kiriath-jearim),
c23543	and Rabbah— two cities, along with their villages.
c23544	[These were] in the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah,
c23545	Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi— six cities, along with their villages.
c23546	But the descendants of Judah could not ... the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem. ... among
c23547	drive out
c23548	So to this day the Jebusites live [there] ... the descendants of Judah.
c23549	The allotment for the descendants of Joseph extended from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east, through the wilderness
c23550	that goes up from Jericho into the hill country of Bethel.
c23551	It went on from Bethel ([that is,] Luz)
c23552	and proceeded to the border of the Archites in Ataroth.
c23553	Then it descended westward to the border of the Japhletites as far as the border of lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer,
c23554	and ended at the Sea.
c23555	So Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, received their inheritance.
c23556	This was the territory of the descendants of Ephraim by their clans:
c23557	The border of their inheritance went from Ataroth-addar in the east to Upper Beth-horon
c23558	and out toward the Sea. From Michmethath on the north
c23559	it turned eastward toward Taanath-shiloh
c23560	and passed by it to Janoah on the east.
c23561	From Janoah it went down to Ataroth
c23562	and Naarah,
c23563	and then reached Jericho
c23564	and came out at the Jordan.
c23565	From Tappuah the border went westward to the Brook of Kanah
c23566	and ended at the Sea.
c23567	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Ephraim,
c23568	[along] with all the cities and villages set apart for the descendants of Ephraim within the inheritance of Manasseh.
c23569	But they did not drive out the Canaanites
c23570	who lived in Gezer.
c23571	So the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day,
c23572	but they are forced laborers.
c23573	Now this was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh
c23574	as Joseph’s firstborn son,
c23575	[namely] for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh and father of the Gileadites,
c23576	because [Machir] was a man of war.
c23577	who had received Gilead and Bashan
c23578	So this allotment was for the rest of the descendants of Manasseh— the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida.
c23579	These are the other male descendants of the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph.
c23580	But Zelophehad son of Hepher (the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh)
c23581	had no sons
c23582	but only daughters.
c23583	These are the names of his daughters:
c23584	Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
c23585	They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders,
c23586	and said,
c23587	“The LORD commanded Moses
c23588	to give us an inheritance among our brothers.”
c23589	So [Joshua] gave them an inheritance among their father's brothers, in keeping with the command of the LORD.
c23590	Thus ten shares fell to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan
c23591	beyond the Jordan,
c23592	because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons.
c23593	And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
c23594	Now the border of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethath
c23595	near Shechem,
c23596	then southward to include the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
c23597	The region of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh,
c23598	but Tappuah itself, on the border of Manasseh, belonged to Ephraim.
c23599	From there the border continued southward to the Brook of Kanah.
c23600	There were cities belonging to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh,
c23601	but the border of Manasseh [was] on the north side of the brook
c23602	and ended at the Sea.
c23603	Ephraim’s [territory] was to the south,
c23604	and Manasseh’s ... to the north,
c23605	was ... having the Sea as its border
c23606	and adjoining Asher on the north
c23607	and Issachar on the east.
c23608	Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh was assigned Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor (that is, Naphath), Endor, Taanach, [and] Megiddo, each with their surrounding settlements.
c23609	But the descendants of Manasseh were unable
c23610	to occupy these cities,
c23611	because the Canaanites were determined
c23612	to stay in this land.
c23613	However,
c23614	when the Israelites grew stronger,
c23615	they put the Canaanites to forced labor;
c23616	but they failed to drive them out completely.
c23617	Then the sons of Joseph said to Joshua,
c23619	“Why have you given us [only] one portion as an inheritance?
c23620	We have many people,
c23621	because the LORD has blessed us abundantly.”
c23622	Joshua answered them,
c23623	“If you have so many people
c23624	go to the forest
c23625	and clear for yourself an area in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim.”
c23626	that the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you,
c23627	[they] replied,
c23628	“The hill country is not enough for us,”
c23629	“and all the Canaanites ... have iron chariots,
c23630	who live in the valley
c23631	both in Beth-shean with its towns
c23632	and in the valley of Jezreel.”
c23633	So Joshua said to the house of Joseph— to Ephraim and Manasseh—
c23635	“You have many people
c23636	and great strength.
c23637	You shall not have just one allotment,
c23638	because the hill country will be yours as well.
c23639	It is a forest;
c23640	clear it,
c23641	and its farthest limits will be yours.
c23642	Although ... drive them out.”
c23643	[the Canaanites] have iron chariots, and although
c23644	they are strong, you can
c23645	Then the whole congregation of Israel assembled at Shiloh
c23646	and set up the Tent of Meeting there.
c23647	And though the land was subdued before them,
c23648	there were still ... of Israel
c23649	who had not yet received their inheritance.
c23650	seven tribes
c23651	So Joshua said to the Israelites,
c23652	“How long will you neglect
c23653	to go out
c23654	and possess the land
c23655	that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?
c23656	Appoint three men from each tribe,
c23657	and I will send them out
c23659	to survey the land
c23660	and map it out, according to the inheritance of each.
c23661	Then they will return to me
c23662	and divide [the land] into seven portions.
c23663	Judah shall remain in their territory in the south
c23664	and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory in the north.
c23665	When you have mapped out the seven portions of land
c23666	and brought it to me,
c23667	I will cast lots for you here in the presence of the LORD our God.
c23668	The Levites, however, have no portion among you,
c23669	because their inheritance is the priesthood of the LORD.
c23670	And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received the inheritance ... beyond the Jordan to the east.”
c23671	that Moses the servant of the LORD gave them
c23672	As the men got up
c23673	to go out,
c23674	Joshua commanded them
c23675	to map out of the land,
c23676	saying,
c23677	“Go
c23678	and survey the land,
c23679	map it out,
c23680	and return to me.
c23681	Then I will cast lots for you here in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD.”
c23682	So the men departed
c23683	and went throughout the land,
c23684	mapping it city by city into seven portions. ... with the document
c23685	Then they returned ... to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh.
c23686	And Joshua cast lots for them in the presence of the LORD at Shiloh,
c23687	where he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their divisions.
c23688	The [first] lot came up for the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.
c23689	Their allotted territory lay between the [tribes] of Judah and Joseph:
c23690	On the north side their border began at the Jordan,
c23691	went up past the northern slope of Jericho,
c23692	headed west through the hill country,
c23693	and came out at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
c23694	From there the border crossed over to the southern slope of Luz
c23695	(that is, Bethel)
c23696	and went down to Ataroth-addar on the hill
c23697	south of Lower Beth-horon.
c23698	the border curved
c23699	On the west side ... southward from the hill
c23700	facing Beth-horon on the south
c23701	and came out at Kiriath-baal
c23702	(that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah.
c23703	This was the western side.
c23704	On the south side ... began at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim
c23705	the border ... and extended westward
c23706	to the spring at the Waters of Nephtoah.
c23707	Then [it] went down to the foot of the hill
c23708	that faces the Valley of Hinnom
c23709	at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim
c23710	and ran down the Valley of Hinnom toward the southern slope of the Jebusites
c23711	and downward to En-rogel.
c23712	From there it curved northward
c23713	and proceeded to En-shemesh
c23714	and on to Geliloth
c23715	facing the Ascent of Adummim,
c23716	and continued down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
c23717	Then it went on to the northern slope of Beth-arabah
c23718	and went down into the valley.
c23719	The border continued to the northern slope of Beth-hoglah
c23720	and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan. ... border.
c23721	This was the southern
c23722	On the east side the border was the Jordan.
c23723	These [were the] borders around the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.
c23724	These were the cities of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin: Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz,
c23725	Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
c23726	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
c23727	Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba— twelve cities, along with their villages.
c23728	Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
c23729	Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,
c23730	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
c23731	Zelah Haeleph, Jebus
c23732	(that is, Jerusalem),
c23733	Gibeah, and Kiriath-jearim— fourteen cities, along with their villages.
c23734	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.
c23735	The second lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Simeon:
c23736	Their inheritance lay within the territory of Judah
c23737	and included Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah,
c23738	Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem,
c23739	Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
c23740	Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah,
c23741	Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen— thirteen cities, along with their villages.
c23742	Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan— four cities, along with their villages,
c23743	and all the villages
c23744	surrounding these cities
c23745	as far as Baalath-beer (Ramah of the Negev).
c23746	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Simeon.
c23747	The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from the territory of Judah,
c23748	because the share for Judah’s descendants was too large for them.
c23749	So the Simeonites received an inheritance within Judah’s portion.
c23750	The third lot came up for the clans of the tribe of Zebulun:
c23751	The border of their inheritance stretched as far as Sarid.
c23752	[It] went up westward to Maralah,
c23753	reached Dabbesheth,
c23754	and met the brook
c23755	east of Jokneam.
c23756	From Sarid it turned eastward along the border of Chisloth-tabor
c23757	and went on to Daberath
c23758	and up to Japhia.
c23759	From there it crossed eastward to Gath-hepher and to Eth-kazin;
c23760	it extended to Rimmon
c23761	and curved around toward Neah.
c23762	Then the border circled around the north side [of Neah] to Hannathon
c23763	and ended at the Valley of Iphtah-el.
c23764	It also included Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem. There were twelve cities, along with their villages.
c23765	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Zebulun, including these cities and their villages.
c23766	The fourth lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Issachar:
c23767	Their territory included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem,
c23768	Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,
c23769	Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,
c23770	Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez.
c23771	The border reached Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh,
c23772	and ended at the Jordan. There were sixteen cities, along with their villages.
c23773	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Issachar, including the cities and their villages.
c23774	The fifth lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Asher:
c23775	Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph,
c23776	Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal.
c23777	On the west [the border] touched Carmel
c23778	and Shihor-libnath,
c23779	then turned eastward toward Beth-dagon,
c23780	touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah-el, and went north to Beth-emek and Neiel,
c23781	passing Cabul on the left.
c23782	[It went on] to Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon.
c23783	The border then turned back toward Ramah as far as the fortified city of Tyre,
c23784	turned toward Hosah,
c23785	and came out at the Sea in the region of Achzib,
c23786	Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob. [There were] twenty-two cities, along with their villages.
c23787	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Asher, including these cities and their villages.
c23788	The sixth lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Naphtali:
c23789	Their border started at Heleph and the great tree of Zaanannim, passing Adami-nekeb and Jabneel as far as Lakkum
c23790	and ending at the Jordan.
c23791	Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor
c23792	and ran from there to Hukkok,
c23793	touching Zebulun on the south side,
c23794	Asher on the west,
c23795	and Judah at the Jordan on the east.
c23796	The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,
c23797	Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
c23798	Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor,
c23799	Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh. [There were] nineteen cities, along with their villages.
c23800	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Naphtali, including the cities and villages.
c23801	The seventh lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Dan:
c23802	The territory of their inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh,
c23803	Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,
c23804	Elon, Timnah, Ekron,
c23805	Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
c23806	Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon,
c23807	Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, including the territory across from Joppa.
c23808	(Later, when the territory of the Danites was lost
c23809	[to them], they went up
c23810	and fought against Leshem,
c23811	captured it,
c23812	and struck it down with the sword.
c23813	So they took possession of [Leshem],
c23814	settled [there],
c23815	and renamed [it] after their father Dan.)
c23816	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Dan, including these cities and villages.
c23817	When they had finished
c23818	distributing the land into its territories,
c23819	the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them,
c23820	as the LORD had commanded. They gave him the city
c23821	as he requested.
c23822	of Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim,
c23823	He rebuilt the city
c23824	and settled there.
c23825	These [were] the inheritances
c23826	that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families distributed by lot to the tribes of Israel at Shiloh before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c23827	So they finished
c23828	dividing up the land.
c23829	Then the LORD said to Joshua,
c23831	“Tell the Israelites
c23833	to designate the cities of refuge,
c23834	as I instructed you through Moses,
c23835	so that anyone who kills another unintentionally or accidentally may flee there.
c23836	These will be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
c23837	When someone flees to one of these cities,
c23838	stands at the entrance of the gate of the city,
c23839	and states his case before [its] elders,
c23840	they are to bring him into the city
c23841	and give him a place
c23842	to live among them.
c23843	Now if the avenger of blood pursues him,
c23844	they must not deliver the manslayer into his hands,
c23845	because [that man] killed his neighbor accidentally
c23846	without prior malice.
c23847	He is to stay in that city
c23848	until he stands trial before the assembly
c23849	and until the death of the high priest
c23850	serving at that time. ... from which
c23851	Then the manslayer may return
c23852	to his own home in the city
c23853	he fled.”
c23854	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba
c23855	(that is, Hebron)
c23856	in the hill country of Judah.
c23857	And beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho, they designated Bezer on the wilderness plateau from the tribe of Reuben,
c23858	Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad,
c23859	and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.
c23860	These are the cities appointed for all the Israelites and foreigners
c23861	among them,
c23862	so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there
c23863	and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood
c23864	prior to standing [trial] before the assembly.
c23865	Now the family heads of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the [other] tribes of Israel
c23866	at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying,
c23868	“The LORD commanded through Moses
c23869	that we be given cities
c23870	in which to live,
c23871	along with pasturelands for our livestock.”
c23872	So by the command of the LORD, the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pasturelands out of their own inheritance:
c23873	The [first] lot came out for the Kohathite clans.
c23874	The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.
c23875	The remaining descendants of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
c23876	The descendants of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
c23877	The descendants of Merari received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
c23878	So the Israelites allotted to the Levites these cities along with their pasturelands,
c23879	as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
c23881	From the tribes of Judah and Simeon, they designated these cities
c23882	by name
c23883	to the descendants of Aaron from the Kohathite clans of the Levites,
c23884	because the first lot fell to them:
c23885	They gave them Kiriath-arba ... (Arba was the father of Anak.)
c23886	(that is, Hebron), ... in the hill country of Judah.
c23887	with its surrounding pasturelands,
c23888	But they had given the fields and villages around the city to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
c23889	So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave [these cities] with their pasturelands: Hebron, a city of refuge for the manslayer,
c23890	Libnah,
c23891	Jattir, Eshtemoa,
c23892	Holon, Debir,
c23893	Ain, Juttah, and Beth-shemesh— nine cities from these two tribes, along with their pasturelands.
c23894	And from the tribe of Benjamin they gave them Gibeon, Geba,
c23895	Anathoth, and Almon— four cities, along with their pasturelands.
c23896	Altogether thirteen cities with their pasturelands [were given] to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
c23897	clans
c23898	The remaining Kohathite ... of the Levites
c23899	were allotted these cities: From the tribe of Ephraim
c23900	they were given Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim (a city of refuge for the manslayer),
c23901	Gezer,
c23902	Kibzaim, and Beth-horon— four cities, along with their pasturelands.
c23903	From the tribe of Dan [they were given] Elteke, Gibbethon,
c23904	Aijalon, and Gath-rimmon— four cities, along with their pasturelands.
c23905	And from the half-tribe of Manasseh [they were given] Taanach and Gath-rimmon— two cities, along with their pasturelands.
c23906	Altogether ten cities with their pasturelands [were given] to the rest of the Kohathite clans.
c23907	[This is what] the Levite clans of the Gershonites [were given]: From the half-tribe of Manasseh [they received] Golan in Bashan, a city of refuge for the manslayer,
c23908	and Beeshterah— two cities, along with their pasturelands.
c23909	From the tribe of Issachar [they received] Kishion, Daberath,
c23910	Jarmuth, and En-gannim— four cities, along with their pasturelands.
c23911	From the tribe of Asher they received Mishal, Abdon,
c23912	Helkath, and Rehob— four cities, along with their pasturelands.
c23913	And from the tribe of Naphtali [they received] Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for the manslayer),
c23914	Hammoth-dor, and Kartan— three cities, along with their pasturelands.
c23915	Altogether thirteen cities with their pasturelands [were given] to the Gershonite clans.
c23916	[This is what] the Merarite clan (the rest of the Levites) were given: From the tribe of Zebulun [they received] Jokneam, Kartah,
c23917	Dimnah, and Nahalal— four cities, along with their pasturelands.
c23918	From the tribe of Reuben [they received] Bezer, Jahaz,
c23919	Kedemoth, and Mephaath— four cities, along with their pasturelands.
c23920	And from the tribe of Gad [they received] Ramoth in Gilead, a city of refuge for the manslayer,
c23921	Mahanaim,
c23922	Heshbon, and Jazer— four cities in all, along with their pasturelands.
c23923	Altogether ... cities ... to the clans of Merari,
c23924	the remaining Levite clans.
c23925	twelve ... were allotted
c23926	So in all there were forty-eight cities for the Levites, along with their pasturelands, within the territory of the Israelites.
c23927	Each of these cities had
c23928	its own surrounding pasturelands;
c23929	this was true for all the cities.
c23930	Thus the LORD gave Israel all the land
c23931	He had sworn
c23932	to give their fathers,
c23933	and they took possession of
c23934	it and settled there.
c23935	And the LORD gave them rest on every side, just as
c23936	He had sworn to their fathers.
c23937	None of their enemies could stand against them, ... all
c23938	for the LORD delivered ... their enemies into their hand.
c23939	Not one of all ... good promises ... failed;
c23940	the LORD's ... to the house of Israel
c23941	everything was fulfilled.
c23942	Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh
c23943	and told them,
c23944	“You have done all
c23945	that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you,
c23946	and you have obeyed my voice in all
c23947	that I commanded you.
c23948	All this time you have not deserted your brothers, up to this very day,
c23949	but have kept the charge given you by the LORD your God.
c23950	And now that the LORD your God has given your brothers rest
c23951	as He promised them,
c23953	you may return
c23954	to your homes in the land
c23955	that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you across the Jordan.
c23956	But be very careful
c23957	to observe the commandment and the law
c23958	that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you:
c23959	to love the LORD your God,
c23960	to walk in all His ways,
c23961	to keep His commandments,
c23962	to hold fast to Him,
c23963	and to serve Him with all your heart and all your soul.”
c23964	So Joshua blessed them
c23965	and sent them on their way,
c23966	and they went to their homes.
c23967	(To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan,
c23968	and to the other half Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan among their brothers.)
c23969	When Joshua sent them to their homes
c23970	he blessed them,
c23971	saying, ... to
c23973	“Return ... your homes with your great wealth, with immense herds of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and very many clothes.
c23974	Divide with your brothers the spoil of your enemies.”
c23976	So the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh
c23977	in the land of Canaan ... which
c23978	to return to their own land of Gilead,
c23979	they had acquired according to the command of the LORD through Moses.
c23980	And when they came to Geliloth near the Jordan
c23981	in the land of Canaan,
c23982	the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built ... altar there by the Jordan.
c23983	an imposing
c23984	Then the Israelites received
c23985	the report:
c23986	“Behold, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the border of the land of Canaan, at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side.”
c23987	And when [they] heard this,
c23988	the whole congregation of Israel assembled at Shiloh
c23989	to go to war against them.
c23990	The Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the land of Gilead, to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
c23991	With him [they sent] ten chiefs—
c23992	one family leader from each tribe of Israel,
c23993	each
c23994	the head of a family among the clans of Israel.
c23995	They went to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead
c23996	and said to them,
c23998	“This is what the whole congregation of the LORD says:
c23999	‘What is this ... you have committed
c24000	breach of faith ... against the God of Israel
c24001	today ... by turning away from the LORD
c24002	and building for yourselves an altar,
c24003	that you might rebel against the LORD this day?
c24004	Was not the sin of Peor enough for us,
c24005	from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day?
c24006	It even brought a plague upon the congregation of the LORD.
c24007	And now, would you turn away from the LORD?
c24009	If you rebel today against the LORD,
c24010	tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
c24011	If indeed the land of your inheritance is unclean,
c24012	[then] cross over to the land of the LORD's possession,
c24013	where the LORD’s tabernacle stands,
c24014	and take possession of it among us.
c24015	But do not rebel against the LORD
c24017	or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God.
c24018	Was not Achan son of Zerah unfaithful regarding what was set apart for destruction,
c24019	bringing wrath upon the whole congregation of Israel?
c24020	only [Achan]
c24021	Yet it was not ... who perished because of his sin!’”
c24022	Then the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered
c24023	the leaders of the clans of Israel,
c24024	“The LORD, the Mighty One, [is] God! The LORD, The Mighty One, [is] God!
c24025	He knows,
c24026	and may Israel
c24027	also know.
c24028	If [this] was in rebellion
c24029	or breach of faith against the LORD,
c24030	do not spare us today.
c24031	If we have built for ourselves an altar
c24032	to turn away from Him
c24033	and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings on it,
c24034	or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it,
c24035	may the LORD
c24036	Himself hold us accountable.
c24037	But in fact we have done this for fear
c24038	might say
c24039	that in the future your descendants ... to ours,
c24041	‘What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?
c24042	For the LORD has made ... a border between us and you—
c24043	you Reubenites and Gadites. ... So your descendants
c24044	the Jordan
c24045	You have no share in the LORD!’
c24046	could cause ours to stop
c24047	fearing the LORD.
c24048	That is why we said,
c24049	‘Let us take action
c24050	and build an altar for ourselves,
c24051	but not for burnt offerings
c24052	or sacrifices.
c24053	Rather, let it be a witness between us and you and the generations to come,
c24054	that we will worship the LORD in His presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings.’
c24055	Then in the future, your descendants cannot say to ours,
c24056	‘You have no share in the LORD!’
c24057	Therefore we said,
c24059	‘If they ever say [this] to us or to our descendants,
c24060	we will answer:
c24061	Here is the copy of the altar of the LORD
c24062	that our fathers made,
c24063	not for burnt offerings
c24064	or sacrifices,
c24065	but as a witness between us and you.’
c24066	Far be it from us
c24067	to rebel against the LORD
c24068	and turn away from Him today
c24069	by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, other than the altar of the LORD our God,
c24070	which [stands] before His tabernacle.”
c24071	When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation— the heads of Israel’s clans ... heard
c24072	who were with him—
c24074	what the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh had to say,
c24075	they were satisfied.
c24076	Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, ... the Israelites
c24077	“Today we know
c24078	that the LORD is among us,
c24079	because you have not committed this breach of faith against Him.
c24080	Consequently, you have delivered ... from the hand of the LORD.”
c24081	Then Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned to the Israelites in the land of Canaan ... the Reubenites and Gadites in the land of Gilead.
c24082	and brought back a report regarding
c24083	The Israelites were satisfied with the report,
c24084	and they praised God
c24085	and spoke no
c24086	more about going to war against them
c24087	to destroy the land
c24088	where the Reubenites and Gadites lived.
c24089	So the Reubenites and Gadites named the altar [Witness],
c24090	[saying], “It is a witness between us
c24091	that the LORD is God.”
c24092	A long time
c24093	after the LORD had given Israel rest from all the enemies around them,
c24094	when Joshua was old
c24095	[and] advanced in years,
c24096	[he] summoned all Israel, including its elders, leaders, judges, and officers.
c24097	he said,
c24098	“I am old
c24099	[and] advanced in years,”
c24100	“and you have seen everything
c24101	that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake,
c24102	because ... was the LORD your God
c24103	it
c24104	who fought for you.
c24105	See,
c24106	I have allotted as an inheritance to your tribes these remaining nations, ... from the Jordan
c24107	including all the nations
c24108	I have already cut off,
c24109	westward to the Great Sea.
c24110	The LORD your God
c24111	will push them out of your way
c24112	and drive them out before you,
c24113	so that you can take possession of their land,
c24114	as the LORD your God promised you.
c24115	Be very strong, then,
c24116	so that you can keep
c24117	and obey all
c24118	that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses,
c24119	not turning aside from it to the right or to the left.
c24120	So you are not to associate with these nations remaining among you.
c24121	Do not call on the names of their gods
c24122	or swear by them, and you must not
c24123	serve them
c24124	[or] bow down to them.
c24125	Instead, you shall hold fast to the LORD your God,
c24126	as you have done to this day.
c24127	The LORD has driven out great and powerful nations before you,
c24129	and to this day no one can stand against you.
c24130	One of you can put a thousand {to flight},
c24131	because the LORD your God
c24133	fights for you,
c24134	just as He promised.
c24135	Therefore watch yourselves carefully,
c24136	that you love the LORD your God.
c24137	For
c24138	if you turn away
c24139	and cling to the rest of these nations that remain among you,
c24140	and if you intermarry
c24141	and associate
c24142	with them,
c24143	know for sure
c24144	that the LORD your God will no longer
c24145	drive out these nations before you.
c24146	Instead, they will become for you a snare and a trap, a scourge for your sides and thorns in your eyes,
c24147	until you perish from this good land
c24148	that the LORD your God has given you.
c24149	Now behold,
c24150	today I am going the way of all the earth,
c24151	and you know with all your heart [and] soul
c24152	that not one ... the good promises ... has failed. Everything ... promise
c24153	the LORD your God made to you
c24154	was fulfilled for you;
c24155	of ... not one ... has failed.
c24157	But just as every good thing ... has come to pass,
c24158	the LORD your God promised you
c24159	likewise the LORD will bring upon you the calamity He has threatened,
c24160	until He has destroyed you from this good land
c24161	[He] has given you.
c24162	If you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God,
c24163	which He commanded you,
c24164	and go
c24165	and serve other gods
c24166	and bow down to them,
c24167	the LORD’s anger will burn against you,
c24168	and you will quickly perish from this good land
c24169	He has given you.”
c24170	Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem.
c24171	He summoned the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel,
c24172	and they presented themselves before God.
c24173	And Joshua said to all the people,
c24174	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c24175	‘Long ago your fathers, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates
c24176	and worshiped other gods.
c24177	But I took your father Abraham from beyond the Euphrates
c24178	and led him through all the land of Canaan,
c24179	and I multiplied his descendants.
c24180	I gave him Isaac,
c24181	and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau.
c24182	I apportioned to Esau the hill country of Seir,
c24184	but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
c24185	Then I sent Moses and Aaron,
c24186	and I afflicted the Egyptians
c24187	by what I did there,
c24188	and afterward I brought you out.
c24189	When I brought your fathers out of Egypt
c24190	and you reached the Red Sea,
c24191	the Egyptians pursued [them] with chariots and horsemen as far as the Red Sea.
c24192	So [your fathers] cried out to the LORD,
c24193	and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians,
c24194	over whom He brought the sea
c24195	and engulfed them.
c24196	Your very eyes saw
c24197	what I did to the Egyptians.
c24198	Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time.
c24199	Later, I brought you to the land of the Amorites
c24200	who lived beyond the Jordan.
c24201	They fought against you,
c24202	but I gave them into your hands,
c24203	that you should possess their land
c24204	when I destroyed them before you.
c24205	Then Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, set out
c24206	to fight against Israel.
c24207	He sent
c24208	for Balaam son of Beor
c24209	to curse you,
c24210	but I would not
c24211	listen to Balaam.
c24212	So he blessed you again and again,
c24213	and I delivered you from his hand.
c24214	After this, you crossed the Jordan
c24215	and came to Jericho.
c24216	The people of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites,
c24217	and I delivered them into your hands.
c24218	I sent the hornet ahead of you,
c24219	and it drove out the two Amorite kings before you,
c24220	[but] not by your own sword
c24221	or bow.
c24222	So I gave you a land
c24223	on which you did not toil
c24224	and cities
c24225	that you did not build,
c24226	and now you live in them
c24227	from vineyards and olive groves
c24228	that you did not plant.’
c24229	and eat
c24230	Now, therefore,
c24231	fear the LORD
c24232	and serve Him in sincerity and truth;
c24233	cast aside the gods
c24234	your fathers served beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt,
c24235	and serve the LORD.
c24236	But if it is unpleasing in your sight
c24237	to serve the LORD,
c24238	choose for yourselves this day
c24239	whom you will serve,
c24240	whether the gods
c24241	your fathers served ... in whose
c24242	beyond the Euphrates,
c24243	or the gods of the Amorites
c24244	land you are living.
c24245	As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD!”
c24246	The people replied,
c24248	“Far be it from us
c24249	to forsake the LORD
c24250	to serve other gods!
c24251	For the LORD our God
c24253	brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,
c24254	and performed these great signs before our eyes. ... through which
c24255	He also protected us all throughout our journey
c24257	and among all the nations
c24258	we traveled.
c24259	And the LORD drove out ... all the nations, including the Amorites
c24260	who lived in the land.
c24261	before us
c24262	We too will serve the LORD,
c24263	because He is our God!”
c24264	But Joshua said to the people,
c24265	“You are not able
c24266	to serve the LORD,
c24267	for He is a holy God;
c24268	He is a jealous God;
c24269	He will not forgive your rebellion or your sins.
c24270	If you forsake the LORD
c24271	and serve foreign gods,
c24272	He will turn
c24273	and bring disaster on you
c24274	and consume you,
c24275	even after He has been good to you.”
c24276	replied the people.
c24277	“No!”
c24278	“We will serve the LORD!”
c24279	Then Joshua told [them],
c24280	“You are witnesses against yourselves
c24281	that you have chosen ... the LORD.”
c24282	to serve
c24283	they said.
c24284	“We are witnesses!”
c24285	“Now, therefore,” [he said],
c24286	“get rid of the foreign gods
c24287	among you
c24288	and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.”
c24289	So the people said to Joshua,
c24290	“We will serve the LORD our God
c24291	and obey His voice.”
c24292	On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people,
c24293	and there at Shechem he established for them a statute and ordinance.
c24294	Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God.
c24295	Then he took a large stone
c24296	and set it up there under the oak
c24297	that [was] near the sanctuary of the LORD.
c24298	And Joshua said to all the people,
c24299	“You see this stone. It will be a witness against us,
c24300	for it has heard all the words the LORD
c24301	has spoken to us,
c24302	and it will be a witness against you
c24303	if you ever deny your God.”
c24304	Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.
c24305	Some time later,
c24306	Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110.
c24307	And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath-serah
c24308	in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.
c24309	Israel had served the LORD through all the days of Joshua [and] of the elders
c24310	who outlived [him]
c24311	and had experienced all the works the LORD
c24312	had done for Israel.
c24313	Also, the bones of Joseph,
c24314	which the Israelites had brought up out of Egypt,
c24315	were buried at Shechem in the plot of land
c24316	that Jacob had purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver.
c24317	So it became an inheritance for Joseph’s descendants.
c24318	And Eleazar son of Aaron died,
c24319	and they buried him at Gibeah, ... to his son Phinehas
c24320	which had been given ... in the hill country of Ephraim.
c24321	After the death of Joshua,
c24322	the Israelites inquired of the LORD,
c24324	“Who will be the first to go up ... against the Canaanites?”
c24325	and fight for us
c24326	The LORD answered,
c24327	“Judah shall go up.
c24328	Indeed, I have delivered the land into their hands.”
c24329	Then the men of Judah said to their brothers the Simeonites,
c24330	“Come up with us to our allotted territory,
c24331	and let us fight against the Canaanites.
c24332	And we likewise will go with you to your territory.”
c24333	So the Simeonites went with them.
c24334	When Judah attacked,
c24335	the LORD delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands,
c24336	and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.
c24337	And [there] they found Adoni-bezek
c24338	and fought against him,
c24339	striking down the Canaanites and Perizzites.
c24340	As Adoni-bezek fled,
c24341	they pursued him,
c24342	seized him,
c24343	and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
c24344	Then Adoni-bezek said,
c24345	“Seventy kings
c24346	with their thumbs and big toes cut off
c24347	have gathered [the scraps] under my table.
c24348	As I have done,
c24349	so God has repaid me.”
c24350	And they brought him to Jerusalem,
c24351	where he died.
c24352	Then the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem
c24353	and captured it.
c24354	They put [the city] to the sword
c24355	and set it on fire.
c24356	Afterward, the men of Judah marched down
c24357	to fight against the Canaanites
c24358	living in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the foothills.
c24359	Judah also marched against the Canaanites
c24360	who were living in Hebron
c24361	(formerly known as Kiriath-arba),
c24362	and they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
c24363	From there they marched against the residents of Debir
c24364	(formerly known as Kiriath-sepher).
c24365	And Caleb said,
c24366	“To the man who strikes down Kiriath-sepher
c24367	and captures it,
c24368	I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.”
c24369	So Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s ... brother, captured it,
c24370	younger
c24371	and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
c24372	One day
c24373	[Acsah] came [to Othniel]
c24374	and urged him
c24375	to ask her father for a field.
c24376	When she got off her donkey,
c24377	Caleb asked her,
c24378	“What do you desire?”
c24379	she answered.
c24380	“Give me a blessing,”
c24381	“Since you have given me land in the Negev,
c24382	give me springs of water [as well].”
c24383	So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs.
c24384	Now the descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went up with the men of Judah from the City of Palms to the Wilderness of Judah
c24385	in the Negev near Arad.
c24386	They went
c24387	to live among the people.
c24388	Then the men of Judah went with their brothers the Simeonites,
c24389	struck the Canaanites
c24390	who were living in Zephath,
c24391	and completely destroyed [the city].
c24392	So [it] was called Hormah.
c24393	And Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron— each with its territory.
c24394	The LORD was with Judah,
c24395	and they took possession of the hill country;
c24396	but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plains,
c24397	because they had chariots of iron.
c24398	Judah gave Hebron to Caleb,
c24399	Just as Moses had promised,
c24400	who drove out [the descendants of] the three sons of Anak.
c24401	however, ... the Jebusites
c24402	living in Jerusalem.
c24403	The Benjamites, ... failed to drive out
c24404	And to this day the Jebusites dwell among the Benjamites in Jerusalem.
c24405	The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel,
c24406	and the LORD was with them.
c24407	They sent spies to Bethel
c24408	(formerly known as Luz),
c24409	and when the spies saw
c24410	a man coming out of the city,
c24411	they said to him,
c24412	“Please show us how to get into the city,
c24413	and we will treat you kindly.”
c24414	So [the man] showed them the entrance to the city,
c24415	and they put the city to the sword
c24416	but released that man and all his family.
c24417	And the man went to the land of the Hittites,
c24418	built a city,
c24419	and called it Luz,
c24420	which is its name to this day.
c24421	At that time Manasseh failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, [and] Megiddo, or any of their villages;
c24422	for the Canaanites were determined
c24423	to dwell in this land.
c24425	When Israel became stronger,
c24426	they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor,
c24427	but they never drove them out completely.
c24428	Ephraim also failed to drive out the Canaanites
c24429	living in Gezer;
c24430	so the Canaanites continued to dwell among them in Gezer.
c24431	Zebulun failed to drive out the inhabitants of Kitron [and] Nahalol;
c24432	so the Canaanites lived among them
c24433	and served as forced laborers.
c24434	Asher failed to drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob.
c24435	So the Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land,
c24436	because they did not drive them out.
c24437	Naphtali failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath.
c24438	So [the Naphtalites] also lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land,
c24439	but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath served them as forced laborers.
c24440	The Amorites forced the Danites into the hill country
c24441	and did not allow
c24442	them to come down into the plain.
c24443	And the Amorites were determined
c24444	to dwell in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim.
c24445	But when the house of Joseph grew in strength,
c24446	they pressed the Amorites into forced labor.
c24447	And the border of the Amorites [extended] from the Ascent of Akrabbim to Sela and beyond.
c24448	Now the Angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim
c24449	and said,
c24450	“I brought you up out of Egypt
c24451	and led you into the land
c24452	I had promised to your fathers,
c24453	and I said,
c24454	‘I will never break My covenant with you,
c24455	and you
c24456	are not to make a covenant with the people of this land,
c24457	but you shall tear down their altars.’
c24458	Yet you have not obeyed Me.
c24459	What is this you have done?
c24460	So now I tell you
c24461	that I will not drive out [these people] before you;
c24462	they will be [thorns] in your sides,
c24463	and their gods will be a snare to you.”
c24465	When the Angel of the LORD had spoken these words to all the Israelites,
c24466	the people lifted up their voices
c24467	and wept.
c24468	So they called that place Bochim
c24469	and offered sacrifices there to the LORD.
c24470	After Joshua had dismissed the people,
c24471	the Israelites went out
c24472	each to his own inheritance.
c24473	to take possession of the land,
c24474	And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua [and] of the elders
c24475	who outlived [him]
c24476	[and] had seen all the great works the LORD
c24477	had done for Israel.
c24478	And Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110.
c24479	They buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath-heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
c24480	that whole generation had also been gathered to their fathers,
c24481	After ... another generation rose up,
c24482	who did not know the LORD
c24483	or the works
c24484	He had done for Israel.
c24485	And the Israelites did
c24486	evil in the sight of the LORD
c24487	and served the Baals.
c24488	Thus they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers,
c24489	who had brought them out of the land of Egypt,
c24490	and they followed after various gods of the people
c24491	all around them.
c24492	They bowed down to them
c24493	and provoked the LORD {to anger},
c24494	for they forsook Him
c24495	and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
c24496	Then the anger of the LORD burned against Israel,
c24497	and He handed them over to raiders
c24498	who plundered them.
c24499	He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around,
c24500	whom they were no longer
c24501	able to resist.
c24502	Wherever
c24503	[Israel] marched out,
c24504	the hand of the LORD was against them to bring calamity,
c24505	just as He
c24506	had sworn to them.
c24507	So they were greatly distressed.
c24508	Then the LORD raised up judges,
c24509	who delivered them from the hands of these raiders.
c24510	[Israel,] however, did not listen to their judges.
c24511	Instead, they prostituted themselves with other gods
c24512	and bowed down to them.
c24513	They quickly turned from the way
c24514	of their fathers, who had walked
c24515	in obedience to the LORD’s commandments;
c24516	they did not do as their fathers [had done].
c24517	Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for the Israelites,
c24518	[He] was with that judge
c24519	and delivered them from the hands of their enemies while the judge was still alive;
c24520	for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them.
c24521	But when the judge died,
c24523	the Israelites became even more corrupt than their fathers,
c24524	going after other gods
c24525	to serve them
c24526	and bow down to them.
c24527	They would not turn from their evil practices and stubborn ways.
c24528	So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel,
c24529	and He said,
c24530	“Because this nation has transgressed the covenant
c24531	I laid down for their fathers
c24532	and has not heeded My voice,
c24533	I will no longer
c24534	drive out before them any of the nations
c24535	Joshua left
c24536	when he died.
c24537	In this way I will test ... Israel
c24538	will keep the way of the LORD
c24539	by walking in it
c24540	as their fathers did.”
c24541	whether
c24542	That is why the LORD had left those nations in place
c24543	and had not driven them out immediately
c24544	by delivering them into the hand of Joshua.
c24545	These are the nations
c24546	the LORD left
c24547	to test all the Israelites
c24548	who had not known any of the wars in Canaan,
c24549	if only ... to the subsequent generations of Israel,
c24550	to teach warfare
c24551	especially to those who had not known it formerly:
c24552	the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites
c24553	who lived in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon
c24554	to Lebo-hamath.
c24555	[These nations] were [left]
c24556	to test the Israelites,
c24557	to find out
c24558	whether they would keep the commandments of the LORD,
c24559	which He had given their fathers through Moses.
c24560	Thus the Israelites continued to live among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
c24561	And they took the daughters [of these people] in marriage,
c24562	gave their own daughters to their sons,
c24563	and served their gods.
c24564	So the Israelites did
c24565	evil in the sight of the LORD;
c24566	they forgot the LORD their God
c24567	and served the Baals and the Asherahs.
c24568	Then the anger of the LORD burned against Israel,
c24569	and He sold them into the hands of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia,
c24570	and the Israelites served him eight years.
c24571	But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD,
c24572	[He] raised up ... son ... as a deliverer
c24573	to save
c24574	Othniel ... of Kenaz, Caleb’s ... brother, ... [them].
c24575	youngest
c24576	The Spirit of the LORD came upon him,
c24577	and he became Israel's judge
c24578	and went out to war.
c24579	And the LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into the hands [of Othniel],
c24580	who prevailed against him.
c24581	So the land had rest for forty years,
c24582	until Othniel son of Kenaz died.
c24583	Once again the Israelites
c24584	did
c24585	evil in the sight of the LORD.
c24586	So He gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel,
c24587	because they had done
c24588	evil in the sight of the LORD.
c24589	After enlisting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join forces with him,
c24590	[Eglon] attacked
c24591	and defeated Israel,
c24592	taking possession of the City of Palms.
c24593	The Israelites served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.
c24594	And again [they] cried out to the LORD,
c24595	and He raised up Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed ... as their deliverer.
c24596	Benjamite, ... So [they] sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.
c24597	Now Ehud had made for himself ... sword
c24598	a double-edged
c24599	a cubit long.
c24600	He strapped it to his right thigh under his cloak
c24601	and brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab,
c24602	who was an obese man.
c24604	After Ehud had finished
c24605	presenting the tribute,
c24606	he ushered out those who had carried it.
c24607	But upon reaching the idols ... he himself turned back
c24608	near Gilgal,
c24609	and said,
c24610	“I have a secret message for you,
c24611	O king.”
c24612	said the king,
c24613	“Silence,”
c24614	and all ... left him.
c24615	his attendants
c24616	Then Ehud approached
c24617	him while he was sitting ... in the coolness of his upper room.
c24618	alone
c24619	Ehud said,
c24620	“I have a word from God for you,”
c24621	and the king rose from [his] seat.
c24622	And Ehud reached with his left hand,
c24623	pulled the sword from his right thigh,
c24624	and plunged it into Eglon’s belly.
c24625	Even the handle sank in after the blade,
c24626	and Eglon’s fat closed in over it,
c24627	so that Ehud did not withdraw the sword from his belly.
c24628	And Eglon’s bowels emptied.
c24629	Then Ehud went out through the porch,
c24630	closing ... the doors of the upper room behind him.
c24631	and locking
c24632	After Ehud was gone,
c24633	Eglon’s servants came in
c24635	and found
c24636	the doors of the upstairs room locked.
c24637	they said.
c24638	“He must be relieving himself in the cool room,”
c24639	So they waited
c24640	until they became worried
c24641	and saw
c24642	that he had still not opened the doors of the upper room.
c24643	Then they took the key
c24644	and opened [the doors]—
c24645	and there
c24646	was their lord lying ... on the floor.
c24647	dead
c24648	Ehud, however, had escaped
c24649	while the servants waited.
c24650	He passed by the idols
c24651	and escaped to Seirah.
c24653	On arriving [in Seirah],
c24654	he blew the trumpet throughout the hill country of Ephraim.
c24655	The Israelites came down with him from the hills,
c24656	and he became their leader.
c24657	he told them,
c24658	“Follow me,”
c24659	“for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hands.”
c24660	So they followed him down
c24661	and seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab,
c24662	and did not allow anyone
c24663	to cross over.
c24664	At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men. ... one
c24665	Not ... of them escaped.
c24666	So Moab was subdued under the hand of Israel that day,
c24667	and the land had rest for eighty years.
c24668	After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath.
c24669	striking down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad.
c24670	And he too delivered Israel,
c24671	the Israelites again
c24672	did
c24673	evil in the sight of the LORD.
c24674	After Ehud died,
c24675	So the LORD sold them into the hands of Jabin king of Canaan,
c24676	who reigned in Hazor.
c24677	The commander of his forces was Sisera,
c24678	who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim.
c24679	Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD,
c24680	because Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron,
c24681	and he had harshly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years.
c24682	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth,
c24683	was judging Israel at that time.
c24684	And she would sit under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim,
c24685	where the Israelites would go up to her for judgment.
c24686	She summoned
c24687	Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali
c24688	and said to him,
c24689	“Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you:
c24690	‘Go,
c24691	and march to Mount Tabor,
c24692	taking with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun?
c24693	And I will draw out Sisera the commander of Jabin’s army, his chariots, and his troops to the River Kishon,
c24694	and I will deliver him into your hands.’”
c24695	Barak said to her,
c24696	“If you will go with me,
c24697	I will go;
c24698	but if you will not go with me,
c24699	I will not go.”
c24700	Deborah replied,
c24701	“I will certainly go with you,”
c24702	“but the road ... will bring you no honor,
c24703	you [are taking] ... and went
c24704	because the LORD will be selling Sisera into the hand of a woman.”
c24705	So Deborah got up
c24706	with Barak to Kedesh,
c24707	where he summoned Zebulun and Naphtali;
c24708	ten thousand men followed him,
c24709	and Deborah also went with him.
c24710	Now Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses,
c24711	and had pitched his tent by the great tree of Zaanannim,
c24712	which was near Kedesh.
c24713	When it was reported to Sisera
c24714	that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up Mount Tabor,
c24715	[he] summoned all nine hundred of his iron chariots and all the men
c24716	with him,
c24717	from Harosheth-hagoyim to the River Kishon.
c24718	Then Deborah said to Barak,
c24719	“Arise,
c24720	for this is the day
c24721	the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hands.
c24722	Has not the LORD gone before you?”
c24723	So Barak came down from Mount Tabor
c24724	with ten thousand men following him.
c24725	And in front of [him] the LORD routed with the sword Sisera, all his charioteers, and all his army.
c24726	Sisera abandoned his chariot
c24727	and fled on foot.
c24728	Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim,
c24729	and the whole army of Sisera fell by the sword;
c24730	not a single man was left.
c24731	Meanwhile, Sisera had fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite,
c24732	because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
c24733	Jael went out to greet
c24734	Sisera
c24735	and said to him,
c24736	“Come in,
c24737	my lord.
c24738	Come in with me.
c24739	Do not be afraid.”
c24740	So he went into her tent,
c24741	and she covered him with a blanket.
c24742	[Sisera] said to her,
c24743	“Please give me a little water to drink,
c24744	for I am thirsty.”
c24745	So she opened a container of milk,
c24746	gave him a drink,
c24747	and covered him again.
c24748	he said,
c24749	“Stand at the entrance to the tent,”
c24750	“and
c24751	if anyone comes
c24752	and asks you,
c24753	say,
c24754	‘Is there a man here?’
c24756	‘No.’”
c24757	Heber’s wife Jael took a tent peg,
c24758	grabbed a hammer,
c24759	and went silently to Sisera.
c24760	She drove the peg through his temple
c24761	[and] into the ground,
c24762	But as he lay sleeping
c24763	from exhaustion,
c24764	and he died.
c24765	and there
c24766	When Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera,
c24767	Jael went out
c24768	to greet him
c24769	and said to him,
c24770	“Come,
c24771	and I will show you the man
c24772	you are seeking.”
c24773	So he went in with her,
c24775	lay Sisera
c24776	dead,
c24777	with a tent peg through his temple.
c24778	On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites.
c24779	And the hand of the Israelites grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan
c24780	until they destroyed him.
c24781	On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:
c24783	“When the princes lead in Israel,
c24784	when the people volunteer,
c24785	bless the LORD.
c24786	Listen,
c24787	O kings!
c24788	Give ear,
c24789	O princes!
c24790	I
c24791	will sing to the LORD;
c24792	I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.
c24793	O LORD,
c24794	when You went out from Seir,
c24795	when You marched from the land of Edom,
c24796	the earth trembled,
c24797	the heavens poured [out rain],
c24798	and the clouds poured down water.
c24799	The mountains quaked before the LORD,
c24800	the One of Sinai,
c24801	before the LORD, the God of Israel.
c24802	In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were deserted
c24803	and the travelers took the byways.
c24804	Life in the villages ceased, ... in Israel,
c24805	it ended
c24806	until ... arose,
c24807	I, Deborah,
c24809	a mother in Israel.
c24810	When they chose new gods,
c24811	then war came to their gates.
c24812	a shield
c24813	Not ... was found
c24814	or spear
c24815	among forty thousand in Israel.
c24816	My heart is with the princes of Israel,
c24817	with the volunteers among the people.
c24818	Bless the LORD!
c24819	You who ride white donkeys,
c24820	who sit on saddle blankets,
c24821	and you who travel the road,
c24822	ponder
c24823	the voices of the singers at the watering places. There they shall recount the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous deeds of His warriors in Israel.
c24824	Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates:
c24825	‘Awake,
c24826	awake,
c24827	O Deborah!
c24828	Awake,
c24829	awake,
c24830	sing a song!
c24831	Arise,
c24832	O Barak,
c24833	and take hold of your captives,
c24834	O son of Abinoam!’
c24835	Then the survivors came down to the nobles; the people
c24836	of the LORD came down to me as warriors.
c24837	Some came from Ephraim, with their roots in Amalek;
c24838	after you.
c24839	Benjamin
c24840	came with your people
c24841	The commanders came down from Machir,
c24842	the bearers of the marshal’s staff from Zebulun.
c24843	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah,
c24844	and Issachar
c24845	was with Barak,
c24846	rushing into the valley at his heels.
c24847	In the clans of Reuben was great indecision.
c24848	Why did you sit among the sheepfolds
c24849	to hear the whistling for the flocks?
c24850	In the clans of Reuben was great indecision.
c24851	Gilead remained beyond the Jordan.
c24852	Dan,
c24853	why did you linger by the ships?
c24854	Asher stayed at the coast
c24855	and remained in his harbors.
c24856	Zebulun was a people
c24857	who risked their lives;
c24859	Naphtali, too, on the heights of the battlefield.
c24860	Kings came
c24861	and fought;
c24862	then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo,
c24863	but they took no plunder of silver.
c24864	From the heavens ... fought;
c24865	the stars ... from their courses they fought against Sisera.
c24866	The River Kishon swept them away, the ancient river, the River Kishon.
c24867	March on,
c24868	O my soul,
c24869	in strength!
c24870	Then the hooves of horses thundered— the mad galloping of his stallions.
c24871	‘Curse Meroz,’
c24872	says the angel of the LORD.
c24873	‘Bitterly curse her inhabitants;
c24874	for they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.’
c24875	Most blessed among women [is] Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite,
c24876	most blessed of tent-dwelling women.
c24877	He asked for water,
c24878	[and] she gave him milk.
c24879	In a magnificent bowl she brought him curdled milk.
c24880	She reached for the tent peg, ... hand
c24881	her right ... for the workman's hammer.
c24882	She struck Sisera
c24883	and crushed his skull;
c24884	she shattered
c24885	and pierced his temple.
c24886	At her feet he collapsed,
c24887	he fell,
c24888	there he lay still;
c24889	at her feet he collapsed,
c24890	he fell;
c24891	where he collapsed,
c24892	there he fell dead.
c24893	looked through the window;
c24894	Sisera’s mother ... she peered through the lattice and lamented:
c24895	‘Why is his chariot so long
c24896	in coming?
c24897	What has delayed the clatter of his chariots?’
c24898	Her wisest ladies answer;
c24899	indeed she keeps telling herself,
c24900	‘Are they not finding
c24901	and dividing the spoil—
c24902	a girl [or] two for each warrior,
c24903	a plunder of dyed garments for Sisera, the spoil of embroidered garments
c24904	for the neck of the looter?’
c24905	So may all your enemies perish,
c24906	O LORD,
c24907	But may those who love You
c24908	shine like the sun at its brightest.
c24909	And the land had rest for forty years.
c24910	Again the Israelites did
c24911	evil in the sight of the LORD;
c24912	so He handed them over to Midian for seven years,
c24913	and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel.
c24914	Because of the Midianites, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves
c24915	in the mountains,
c24916	caves, and strongholds.
c24918	Whenever the Israelites would plant their crops,
c24919	the Midianites, Amalekites, and other people of the East would come up
c24920	and invade them,
c24921	encamping against them
c24922	and destroying the produce of the land.
c24923	as far as Gaza
c24924	They left Israel with no sustenance,
c24925	neither sheep nor oxen nor donkeys.
c24926	For the Midianites ... with their livestock
c24927	and their tents
c24928	came ... like a great swarm of locusts.
c24929	They and their camels were innumerable,
c24930	and they entered the land
c24931	to ravage it.
c24932	Israel was greatly impoverished by Midian,
c24933	and the Israelites cried out to the LORD.
c24934	Now
c24935	when the Israelites cried out to the LORD because of Midian,
c24936	[He] sent them a prophet
c24937	who said,
c24938	“This is what the LORD God of Israel says:
c24939	I brought you up out of Egypt,
c24940	out of the house of slavery.
c24941	I delivered you out of the hands of Egypt [and] all your oppressors.
c24942	I drove them out before you
c24943	and gave you their land.
c24944	And I said to you:
c24945	‘I am the LORD your God.
c24946	You must not worship the gods of the Amorites,
c24947	in whose land you dwell.’
c24948	But you did not obey Me.”
c24949	Then the Angel of the LORD came
c24950	and sat down under the oak
c24951	in Ophrah
c24952	that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite,
c24953	where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress
c24954	to hide it from the Midianites.
c24955	And the Angel of the LORD appeared to [Gideon]
c24956	and said,
c24957	“The LORD is with you,
c24958	mighty warrior.”
c24959	Gideon replied,
c24960	“Pardon me, Sir,”
c24961	“but if the LORD is with us,
c24962	why has all this happened to us?
c24963	And where are all His wonders
c24964	about which our fathers told us,
c24965	saying,
c24966	‘Has not the LORD brought us up out of Egypt?’
c24967	But now the LORD has forsaken us
c24968	and delivered us into the hand of Midian.”
c24969	The LORD turned to him
c24970	and said,
c24971	“Go in the strength you have
c24972	and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian.
c24973	Am I not sending you?”
c24974	[Gideon] asked,
c24975	“Please, Lord,”
c24976	“how can I deliver Israel?
c24977	Indeed, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh,
c24978	and I am the youngest in my father’s house.”
c24979	the LORD replied,
c24980	“Surely I will be with you,”
c24981	“and you will strike down [all] the Midianites as one man.”
c24982	Gideon answered,
c24983	“If I have found favor in Your sight,
c24984	give me a sign
c24985	that [it is] You speaking with me.
c24986	Please do not depart from this [place]
c24987	until I return to You.
c24988	Let me bring my gift
c24989	and set [it] before You.”
c24990	And [the LORD] said,
c24991	“I will stay
c24992	until you return.”
c24993	So Gideon went in
c24994	and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread and an ephah of flour.
c24995	He placed the meat in a basket
c24996	and the broth in a pot
c24997	and brought them out ... to Him under the oak.
c24998	to present
c24999	And the Angel of God said to him,
c25000	“Take the meat and the unleavened bread,
c25001	lay [them] on this rock,
c25002	and pour out the broth.”
c25003	And [Gideon] did so.
c25004	Then the Angel of the LORD extended the tip of the staff
c25005	that was in His hand
c25006	and touched the meat and the unleavened bread.
c25007	And fire flared from the rock
c25008	and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread.
c25009	Then the Angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.
c25010	When Gideon realized
c25011	that it [was] the Angel of the LORD,
c25012	he said,
c25013	“Oh no, Lord GOD!
c25015	I have seen the Angel of the LORD face to face!”
c25016	But the LORD said to him,
c25017	“Peace [be] with you.
c25018	Do not be afraid,
c25019	for you will not die.”
c25020	So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there
c25021	and called it
c25022	The LORD is Peace.
c25023	To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
c25024	On that very night
c25025	the LORD said to [Gideon],
c25026	“Take ... young bull
c25027	your father’s
c25028	and a second bull seven years old,
c25029	tear down ... altar to Baal,
c25030	your father's
c25031	the Asherah pole
c25032	beside it.
c25033	and cut down
c25034	Then build a proper altar to the LORD your God on the top of this stronghold.
c25035	take the second bull
c25036	And with the wood of the Asherah pole ... and offer it as a burnt offering.”
c25037	you cut down,
c25038	So Gideon took ten of his servants
c25039	and did
c25040	as the LORD had told him.
c25042	But because he was too afraid of his father’s household and the men of the city,
c25043	[rather than] in the daytime.
c25044	he did [it] by night
c25045	When the men of the city got up in the morning,
c25046	they found
c25047	Baal’s altar torn down,
c25048	the Asherah pole
c25049	beside
c25050	it cut down,
c25051	and the second bull offered up on ... altar.
c25052	the newly built
c25053	they said
c25054	to one another.
c25055	“Who did this?”
c25056	And after they had investigated thoroughly,
c25058	they were told,
c25059	“Gideon son of Joash did it.”
c25060	Then the men of the city said to Joash,
c25061	“Bring out your son.
c25062	He must die,
c25063	because he has torn down Baal’s altar
c25064	and cut down the Asherah pole
c25065	beside it.”
c25066	But Joash said to all
c25067	who stood against him,
c25068	“Are you contending for Baal?
c25069	Are you trying to save him? ... If
c25070	Whoever pleads his case
c25071	will be put to death by morning!
c25072	[Baal] is a god,
c25073	let him contend for himself
c25074	if someone has torn down his altar.”
c25075	So on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal,
c25076	that is to say,
c25077	“Let Baal contend with him,”
c25078	because he had torn down his altar.
c25079	Then all the Midianites, Amalekites, and other people of the East gathered together,
c25080	crossed over [the Jordan],
c25081	and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.
c25082	So the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon,
c25083	and he blew the trumpet
c25084	and rallied the Abiezrites behind him.
c25085	[Gideon] sent messengers throughout Manasseh,
c25086	Calling them to arms, ... as well as
c25087	Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali,
c25088	so that they came up
c25089	to meet him.
c25090	Then Gideon said to God,
c25091	“If You will deliver Israel by my hand,
c25092	as You have said,
c25093	then behold, I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor.
c25094	If there is dew only on the fleece
c25095	and all the ground is dry,
c25096	then I will know
c25097	that You will deliver Israel by my hand,
c25098	as You have said.”
c25099	And that is what happened.
c25100	When [Gideon] arose the next morning,
c25101	he squeezed the fleece
c25102	and wrung out the dew—
c25103	a bowlful of water.
c25104	Then Gideon said to God,
c25105	“Do not be angry with me;
c25106	let me speak one more time.
c25107	Please allow me one more test with the fleece.
c25108	This time let it be dry,
c25109	and the ground be covered with dew.”
c25110	And that night God did so.
c25111	Only the fleece was dry,
c25112	and dew covered the ground.
c25113	Early in the morning Jerubbaal
c25114	(that is, Gideon)
c25115	and all the men
c25116	with him
c25117	camped beside the spring of Harod.
c25118	And the camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.
c25119	The LORD said to Gideon,
c25120	too many people
c25121	“You have
c25122	for Me to deliver Midian into their hands,
c25123	lest Israel glorify themselves over Me,
c25124	saying,
c25125	‘My own hand has delivered me.’
c25126	Now, therefore,
c25127	proclaim in the hearing of the people:
c25129	‘Whoever is fearful and trembling
c25130	may turn back
c25131	and leave Mount Gilead.’”
c25132	So twenty-two thousand [of them] turned back,
c25133	but ten thousand remained.
c25134	the LORD said to Gideon,
c25135	“There are still too many people.
c25136	Take them down to the water,
c25137	and I will sift them for you there.
c25139	If I say to you,
c25140	‘This [one] shall go with you,’
c25141	Then ... he shall go.
c25143	But if I say,
c25144	‘This [one] shall not go with you,’
c25145	he shall not go.”
c25146	So [Gideon] brought the people down to the water,
c25147	and the LORD said to [him],
c25148	those
c25149	who lap the water with their tongues
c25150	like a dog
c25151	“Separate
c25152	from those
c25153	who kneel
c25154	to drink.”
c25155	And the number ... was
c25156	of those who lapped [the water] with their hands to their mouths
c25157	three hundred men;
c25158	all the others knelt
c25159	to drink.
c25160	Then the LORD said to Gideon,
c25161	“With the three hundred men
c25162	who lapped [the water]
c25163	I will save you
c25164	and deliver the Midianites into your hands.
c25165	But all the others are to go
c25166	home.”
c25167	who took charge of the provisions and trumpets of the others.
c25168	So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents ... And
c25169	but kept the three hundred men,
c25170	the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.
c25171	That night
c25172	the LORD said to [Gideon],
c25173	“Get up
c25174	[and] go down against the camp,
c25175	for I have given it into your hands.
c25176	But if you are afraid
c25177	to [do so],
c25178	then go down to the camp with your servant Purah
c25179	and listen
c25180	to what they are saying.
c25181	Then your hands will be strengthened
c25182	to attack the camp.”
c25183	So he went with Purah his servant to the outposts where armed men
c25184	were [guarding] the camp.
c25185	Now the Midianites, Amalekites, and all the other people of the East had settled in the valley like a swarm of locusts,
c25186	and their camels were as innumerable as the sand
c25187	on the seashore.
c25189	And as Gideon arrived,
c25191	a man was telling his friend about a dream.
c25192	he said,
c25193	“Behold, I had a dream,”
c25194	“and I saw a loaf of barley bread ... tumbling into the Midianite camp.
c25195	come ... the tent
c25196	It struck
c25197	so hard that
c25198	overturned
c25199	the tent ... and collapsed.”
c25200	His friend replied:
c25202	“This is nothing
c25203	less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite.
c25204	God has delivered Midian and the whole camp into his hands.”
c25206	When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation,
c25207	he bowed in worship.
c25208	He returned to the camp of Israel
c25209	and said,
c25210	“Get up,
c25211	for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian into your hands.”
c25212	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies
c25213	and gave each man a trumpet in one hand and a large jar [in the other],
c25214	containing a torch.
c25215	[Gideon] said.
c25216	“Watch me
c25217	and do as I do,”
c25218	“When I come to the outskirts of the camp,
c25220	do exactly as
c25221	I do.
c25222	When I and all ... blow our trumpets,
c25223	who [are] with me
c25224	then you are also to blow your trumpets from all around the camp
c25225	and shout,
c25226	‘For the LORD and for Gideon!’”
c25227	Gideon and the hundred men ... reached
c25228	with him
c25229	the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch,
c25230	just after the changing of the guard.
c25231	They blew their trumpets
c25232	and broke the jars
c25233	that [were] in their hands.
c25234	The three companies blew their trumpets
c25235	and shattered their jars.
c25236	Holding the torches in their left hands
c25237	and the trumpets in their right hands,
c25239	they shouted,
c25240	“A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!”
c25241	took
c25242	Each [Israelite] ... his position
c25243	around the camp,
c25244	and the entire Midianite army fled,
c25245	crying out
c25246	as they ran.
c25247	And when the three hundred trumpets sounded,
c25248	the LORD set the swords of every man in the camp against each other.
c25249	The army fled to Beth-shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath.
c25250	Then the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh,
c25251	and they pursued the Midianites.
c25252	Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim
c25253	to say,
c25254	“Come down
c25255	against the Midianites
c25256	and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth-barah.”
c25257	So all the men of Ephraim were called out,
c25258	and they captured the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth-barah.
c25259	They also captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian;
c25260	and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb
c25261	and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb.
c25262	So they pursued the Midianites ... to
c25263	[and] brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb ... Gideon on the other side of the Jordan.
c25264	Then the men of Ephraim said to [Gideon],
c25265	“Why ... this
c25266	have you done ... to us?
c25267	Why did you fail to call us
c25268	when you went
c25269	to fight against Midian?”
c25270	And they contended with him violently.
c25271	But he said to them,
c25272	“What have I accomplished now in comparison with you?
c25273	Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
c25274	God has delivered Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian, into your hands.
c25275	What was I able
c25276	to do in comparison with you?”
c25277	their anger toward him subsided.
c25278	When he said this,
c25279	Then Gideon ... came to the Jordan
c25280	three hundred men ... [and] crossed it,
c25281	and his
c25282	exhausted yet still in pursuit.
c25283	So [Gideon] said to the men of Succoth,
c25284	“Please give my troops some bread,
c25286	for they are exhausted,
c25287	and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
c25288	But the leaders of Succoth asked,
c25289	“[Are] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession,
c25290	that we should give bread to your army?”
c25291	Gideon replied,
c25292	“Very well,”
c25293	“when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands,
c25294	I will tear your flesh with the thorns and briers of the wilderness!”
c25295	From there he went up to Penuel
c25296	and asked the same from them,
c25297	but the men of Penuel gave the same response
c25298	as the men of Succoth.
c25299	So [Gideon] told the men of Penuel,
c25301	“When I return in triumph,
c25302	I will tear down this tower!”
c25303	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor
c25304	with their army of about fifteen thousand [men]—
c25305	all
c25306	that were left of the armies of the people of the East.
c25307	A hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had already fallen.
c25309	And Gideon went up ... route
c25310	by way of the caravan
c25311	east of Nobah and Jogbehah,
c25312	and he attacked their army,
c25313	[taking them] by surprise.
c25314	When Zebah and Zalmunna fled,
c25315	[Gideon] pursued
c25316	and captured these two kings of Midian,
c25317	routing their entire army.
c25318	After this, Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle along the Ascent of Heres.
c25319	There he captured a young man of Succoth
c25320	and interrogated him.
c25321	The young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven leaders and elders of Succoth.
c25322	And [Gideon] went to the men of Succoth
c25323	and said,
c25324	“Here are Zebah and Zalmunna,
c25325	about whom you taunted me,
c25326	saying,
c25327	‘[Are] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession,
c25328	that we should give bread to your weary men?’”
c25329	Then he took the elders of the city, and [using] the thorns and briers of the wilderness,
c25330	he disciplined the men of Succoth.
c25331	He also pulled down the tower of Penuel
c25332	and killed the men of the city.
c25333	Next, [Gideon] asked Zebah and Zalmunna,
c25334	“What kind of men
c25335	did you kill at Tabor?”
c25336	they answered,
c25337	“Men like you,”
c25338	“[each] one resembling the son of a king.”
c25339	Gideon replied,
c25340	“They were my brothers,” ... “the sons of my mother!
c25341	As surely as the LORD lives,
c25342	if you had let them live,
c25343	I would not kill you.”
c25344	So he said to Jether, his firstborn,
c25345	“Get up
c25346	and kill them.”
c25347	But the young man did not draw his sword;
c25348	he was fearful
c25349	because he was still a youth.
c25350	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said,
c25351	“Get up ... us yourself,
c25352	and kill
c25353	for as the man is, so is his strength.”
c25354	So Gideon arose
c25355	and killed Zebah and Zalmunna,
c25356	and he took the crescent ornaments
c25357	from the necks of their camels.
c25358	Then the Israelites said to Gideon,
c25359	“Rule over us— you, and your son and grandson—
c25360	for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.”
c25361	But Gideon replied,
c25362	“I will not rule over you,
c25363	nor will my son.
c25364	The LORD shall rule over you.”
c25365	Then he added,
c25366	“Let me make a request of you,
c25367	that each of you give me an earring from his plunder.”
c25368	(Now [the enemy] had gold earrings
c25369	because they were Ishmaelites.)
c25370	they replied.
c25371	“We will give [them] gladly,”
c25372	So they spread out a garment,
c25373	and each man threw an earring from his plunder onto it.
c25374	The weight of the gold earrings ... was
c25375	he had requested
c25376	1,700 [shekels], in addition to the crescent ornaments, the pendants, the purple garments
c25377	of the kings of Midian,
c25378	and the chains
c25379	from the necks of their camels.
c25380	[From all this] Gideon made an ephod,
c25381	which he placed in Ophrah, his hometown.
c25382	But soon all Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there,
c25383	and it became a snare to Gideon and his household.
c25384	In this way Midian was subdued before the Israelites
c25385	and did not ... again.
c25386	raise its head
c25387	So the land had rest for forty years in the days of Gideon,
c25388	and he — Jerubbaal son of Joash— returned
c25389	home and settled down.
c25390	Gideon had seventy sons
c25391	of his own,
c25392	since he had many wives.
c25393	His concubine,
c25394	who [dwelt] in Shechem,
c25395	also bore him a son,
c25396	and he named him Abimelech.
c25397	Later, Gideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age
c25398	and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
c25399	And
c25400	as soon as Gideon was dead,
c25401	the Israelites turned
c25402	and prostituted themselves with the Baals,
c25403	and they set up Baal-berith as their god.
c25404	The Israelites failed to remember the LORD their God
c25405	who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.
c25406	They did not show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) for all the good things
c25407	he had done for Israel.
c25408	Now Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to his mother’s brothers at Shechem
c25409	and said to them and all the clan of his mother,
c25411	“Please ask all the leaders of Shechem,
c25412	‘Is it better for you
c25413	that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you,
c25414	or just one man?’
c25415	Remember
c25416	that I am your own flesh and blood.”
c25417	And when his mother’s brothers spoke all these words about him in the presence of all the leaders of Shechem,
c25418	their hearts were inclined to follow Abimelech,
c25419	for they said,
c25420	“He is our brother.”
c25421	So they gave him seventy [shekels] of silver from the temple of Baal-berith,
c25422	with which Abimelech hired some worthless and reckless men
c25423	to follow him.
c25424	He went to his father’s house in Ophrah,
c25425	and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal.
c25426	But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived,
c25427	because he hid himself.
c25428	Then all the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo gathered
c25429	and proceeded
c25430	beside the oak at the pillar ... to make Abimelech [their] king.
c25431	in Shechem
c25432	When this was reported to Jotham,
c25433	he climbed
c25434	to the top of Mount Gerizim,
c25435	raised his voice,
c25436	and cried out:
c25438	“Listen to me,
c25439	O leaders of Shechem,
c25440	and may God listen to you.
c25441	One day the trees set out
c25442	to anoint a king for themselves.
c25443	They said to the olive tree,
c25444	‘Reign over us.’
c25445	But the olive tree replied,
c25446	‘Should I stop giving my oil
c25447	that honors both God and man,
c25448	to hold
c25449	sway over the trees?’
c25450	Then the trees said to the fig tree,
c25451	‘Come
c25452	and reign over us.’
c25453	But the fig tree replied,
c25454	‘Should I stop giving my sweetness and my good fruit,
c25455	to hold
c25456	sway over the trees?’
c25457	Then the trees said to the grapevine,
c25458	‘Come
c25459	and reign over us.’
c25460	But the grapevine replied,
c25461	‘Should I stop giving my wine
c25462	that cheers [both] God and man,
c25463	to hold
c25464	sway over the trees?’
c25465	Finally all the trees said to the thornbush,
c25466	‘Come
c25467	and reign over us.’
c25468	But the thornbush replied,
c25469	‘If you really are anointing me as king over you,
c25470	come
c25471	and find refuge in my shade.
c25472	But if not,
c25473	may fire come out of the thornbush
c25474	and consume the cedars of Lebanon.”
c25475	Now
c25476	if you have acted faithfully and honestly
c25477	in making Abimelech king,
c25478	if you have done well by Jerubbaal and his family,
c25479	and if you have done to him as he deserves—
c25480	for my father fought for you
c25481	and risked his life
c25482	to deliver you from the hand of Midian,
c25483	but you have risen up against my father's house this day
c25484	and killed his seventy sons on a single stone,
c25485	and you have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the leaders of Shechem
c25486	because he is your brother—
c25487	if you have acted faithfully and honestly toward Jerubbaal and his house this day,
c25488	[then] may you rejoice in Abimelech,
c25489	and he in you.
c25490	But if not,
c25491	may fire come from Abimelech
c25492	and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo,
c25493	and may fire come from the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo
c25494	and consume Abimelech.”
c25495	Then Jotham ran away,
c25496	escaping
c25497	to Beer,
c25498	and he lived there for fear of his brother Abimelech.
c25499	After Abimelech had reigned over Israel for three years,
c25500	God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem
c25501	and caused them to treat Abimelech deceitfully,
c25502	in order that the crime against the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come to justice
c25503	and their blood
c25504	be avenged on their brother Abimelech
c25506	and on the leaders of Shechem,
c25507	who had helped him
c25508	murder his brothers.
c25509	The leaders of Shechem set an ambush against [Abimelech] on the hilltops,
c25510	and they robbed all
c25511	who passed by them on the road.
c25512	So this was reported to Abimelech.
c25513	Meanwhile, Gaal son of Ebed came with his brothers
c25514	and crossed into Shechem,
c25515	and the leaders of Shechem put their confidence in him.
c25516	And after they had gone out into the fields,
c25517	gathered [grapes] from their vineyards,
c25518	and trodden [them],
c25519	they held a festival
c25520	and went into the house of their god;
c25521	and as they ate
c25522	and drank,
c25523	they cursed Abimelech.
c25524	Then Gaal son of Ebed said,
c25525	“Who is Abimelech,
c25526	and who is Shechem,
c25527	that we should serve him?
c25528	Is he not the son of Jerubbaal,
c25529	and is not Zebul his officer?
c25530	You are to serve the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem.
c25531	Why should we serve Abimelech?
c25532	If only this people were under my authority,
c25533	I would remove Abimelech;
c25534	I would say to [him],
c25535	‘Muster your army
c25536	and come out!’”
c25537	When Zebul the governor of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed,
c25538	he burned with anger.
c25539	So he covertly sent messengers to Abimelech
c25540	to say,
c25541	“Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem
c25542	and are stirring up the city against you.
c25543	Now then,
c25544	tonight you and the people ... are to come
c25545	with you
c25546	and lie in wait in the fields.
c25547	And
c25548	in the morning
c25549	at sunrise,
c25550	get up
c25551	and advance against the city.
c25552	When [Gaal] and his men
c25554	come out against you,
c25555	do to them
c25556	whatever you are able.”
c25557	So Abimelech and all his troops set out
c25559	by night
c25560	and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.
c25561	Now Gaal son of Ebed went out
c25562	and stood at the entrance of the city gate
c25563	just as Abimelech and his men came out
c25565	from their hiding places.
c25566	When Gaal saw the people,
c25567	he said to Zebul,
c25568	“Look, people are coming down from the mountains!”
c25569	But Zebul replied,
c25570	“The shadows of the mountains look like men to you.”
c25571	Then Gaal ... again,
c25572	spoke up
c25574	“Look, people are coming down from the center of the land,
c25575	and one company is coming by way of the Diviners’ Oak.”
c25576	Zebul replied.
c25577	“Where is your gloating now?”
c25578	“You said,
c25579	‘Who is Abimelech
c25580	that we should serve him?’
c25581	Are these not the people
c25582	you ridiculed?
c25583	Go out now
c25584	and fight them!”
c25585	So Gaal went out before the leaders of Shechem
c25586	and fought against Abimelech,
c25587	but Abimelech pursued him,
c25588	and Gaal fled before him.
c25589	And many [Shechemites] fell wounded all the way to the entrance of the gate.
c25590	Abimelech stayed in Arumah,
c25591	and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers
c25592	out of Shechem.
c25593	The next day
c25594	the people [of Shechem] went out into the fields,
c25595	and this was reported to Abimelech.
c25596	So he took his men,
c25597	divided them into three companies,
c25598	and waited in ambush in the fields.
c25599	When he saw
c25601	the people coming out of the city,
c25602	he rose up against them
c25603	and attacked them.
c25604	Then Abimelech and the companies
c25605	with him
c25606	rushed forward
c25607	and took their stand at the entrance of the city gate.
c25608	The other two companies rushed against all
c25609	who [were] in the fields
c25610	and struck them down.
c25611	And all that day Abimelech fought against the city
c25612	until he had captured it
c25613	its people.
c25615	and killed
c25616	Then he demolished the city
c25617	and sowed it with salt.
c25618	On hearing of this, all the leaders in the tower of Shechem
c25619	entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith.
c25620	And when it was reported to Abimelech
c25621	that all the leaders in the tower of Shechem were gathered there,
c25622	he and all his men went up to Mount Zalmon.
c25624	Abimelech took his ax in his hand
c25625	and cut a branch from the trees,
c25626	which he lifted
c25627	to his shoulder,
c25628	saying to his men,
c25630	what you have seen
c25631	and do
c25632	“Hurry
c25633	me do.”
c25634	So each man also cut his own branch
c25635	and followed Abimelech.
c25636	Then they piled [the branches] against the inner chamber
c25637	and set it on fire above them,
c25638	killing everyone in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women.
c25639	Then Abimelech went to Thebez,
c25640	encamped against it,
c25641	and captured it.
c25642	But there was a strong tower inside the city,
c25643	and all the men, women, and leaders of the city fled there.
c25644	They locked themselves in
c25645	and went up to the roof of the tower.
c25646	When Abimelech came to ... the tower,
c25647	attack
c25648	he approached its entrance
c25649	to set it on fire.
c25650	But a woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head,
c25651	crushing his skull.
c25652	He quickly called his armor-bearer,
c25653	saying,
c25654	“Draw your sword
c25655	and kill me,
c25656	lest they say of me,
c25657	‘A woman killed him.’”
c25658	So Abimelech’s armor-bearer ran [his sword] through him,
c25659	and he died.
c25660	And when the Israelites saw
c25661	that Abimelech was dead,
c25662	went
c25663	they all ... home.
c25664	In this way God repaid the wickedness ... Abimelech
c25665	that ... had done to his father
c25666	by murdering his seventy brothers.
c25667	And God also brought back upon their own heads all the evil of the men of Shechem.
c25668	So the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came upon them.
c25669	After the time of Abimelech, ... rose
c25670	to deliver Israel.
c25671	a man of Issachar, Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo,
c25672	He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim.
c25673	Tola judged Israel twenty-three years,
c25674	and when he died,
c25675	he was buried in Shamir.
c25676	After [Tola] arose Jair the Gileadite,
c25677	who judged Israel twenty-two years.
c25678	He had thirty sons
c25679	who rode on thirty donkeys.
c25680	And they had thirty towns
c25681	which to this day are called Havvoth-jair.
c25682	in the land of Gilead,
c25683	When Jair died,
c25684	he was buried in Kamon.
c25685	And again the Israelites
c25686	did
c25687	evil in the sight of the LORD.
c25688	They served the Baals, the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab, and the gods of the Ammonites and Philistines.
c25689	Thus they forsook the LORD
c25690	and did not serve Him.
c25691	So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel,
c25692	and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and Ammonites,
c25693	harassed
c25694	who that very year ... and oppressed the Israelites,
c25695	and did so for eighteen years to all the Israelites
c25696	on the other side of the Jordan ... the land of the Amorites.
c25697	in Gilead,
c25698	The Ammonites ... crossed the Jordan
c25699	also ... to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim,
c25700	and Israel was in severe distress.
c25701	Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD,
c25702	saying,
c25703	“We have sinned against You,
c25704	for we have indeed forsaken our God
c25705	and served the Baals.”
c25706	The LORD replied,
c25707	“When the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, Philistines,
c25708	Sidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites oppressed you
c25709	and you cried out to Me,
c25710	did I not deliver you from their hands?
c25711	But you have forsaken Me
c25712	and served other gods,
c25713	so I will no longer
c25714	deliver you.
c25715	Go
c25716	and cry out to the gods
c25717	you have chosen.
c25718	Let them deliver you in your time of distress.”
c25719	the Israelites said to the LORD.
c25720	“We have sinned,”
c25721	“Deal with us
c25722	as You see fit;
c25723	but please deliver us today!”
c25724	So they put away the foreign gods from among them
c25725	and served the LORD,
c25726	and He could no longer bear the misery of Israel.
c25727	Then the Ammonites were called to arms
c25728	and camped in Gilead,
c25729	and the Israelites assembled
c25730	and camped at Mizpah.
c25731	The rulers of Gilead said
c25732	to one another,
c25733	“Whoever
c25734	will launch
c25735	the attack against the Ammonites
c25736	will be the head of all who live in Gilead.”
c25737	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior;
c25738	he was the son of a prostitute,
c25739	and Gilead was his father.
c25740	And Gilead’s wife bore him sons,
c25741	who grew up,
c25742	drove Jephthah out,
c25743	and said to him,
c25744	“You shall have no inheritance in our father’s house,
c25745	because you are the son of another woman.”
c25746	So Jephthah fled from his brothers
c25747	and settled in the land of Tob,
c25748	where a group of rebels joined him
c25749	and traveled with him.
c25750	Some time later,
c25751	when the Ammonites fought against Israel
c25752	and
c25753	made war with [them],
c25754	the elders of Gilead went
c25755	to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.
c25756	they said,
c25757	“Come,”
c25758	“be our commander,
c25759	so that we can fight against the Ammonites.”
c25760	Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead,
c25761	“Did you not hate me
c25762	and expel me from my father’s house?
c25763	So why then have you come to me now
c25764	when you are in distress?”
c25765	They answered Jephthah, ... to you,
c25766	“This is why we now turn
c25767	that you may go with us,
c25768	fight the Ammonites,
c25769	and become leader over all of us who live in Gilead.”
c25770	But Jephthah answered,
c25771	“If you take me back
c25772	to fight the Ammonites
c25773	and the LORD gives them to me,
c25774	will I really be your leader?”
c25775	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah,
c25776	“The LORD is
c25777	our witness
c25778	if we do not ... as you say.”
c25779	do
c25780	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead,
c25781	and the people put him over themselves as leader and commander.
c25782	And Jephthah repeated all his terms in the presence of the LORD at Mizpah.
c25783	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites,
c25784	saying,
c25785	“What do you have against me
c25786	that you have come ... against
c25787	to fight ... my land?”
c25788	The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah’s messengers,
c25789	“When Israel ... they seized my land,
c25790	came up out of Egypt,
c25791	from the Arnon to the Jabbok and all the way to the Jordan.
c25792	Now, therefore, restore it peaceably.”
c25793	Jephthah again
c25794	sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites
c25795	to tell him,
c25796	“This is what Jephthah says:
c25797	Israel did not take away the land of Moab [or] of the Ammonites.
c25798	But
c25799	when [Israel] came up out of Egypt,
c25800	[they] traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea
c25801	and came to Kadesh.
c25802	Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom,
c25803	saying,
c25804	‘Please let us pass through your land,’
c25805	but the king of Edom would not listen.
c25806	They also sent messengers to the king of Moab,
c25807	but he refused.
c25808	So Israel stayed in Kadesh.
c25809	Then [Israel] traveled through the wilderness
c25810	and bypassed the lands of Edom and Moab. ... of the land
c25811	They came to the east side ... of Moab
c25812	and camped on the other side of the Arnon.
c25813	But they did not enter the territory of Moab,
c25814	since the Arnon was its border.
c25815	And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon,
c25816	and said to him,
c25817	‘Please let us pass through your land into our own place.’
c25818	But Sihon would not trust Israel
c25819	to pass through his territory.
c25820	So [he] gathered all his people,
c25821	encamped in Jahaz,
c25822	and fought with Israel.
c25823	Then the LORD, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hands of Israel,
c25824	who defeated them.
c25825	So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites
c25826	who inhabited that country,
c25827	seizing all the land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
c25828	Now since
c25829	the LORD, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites from before His people Israel,
c25830	should you now possess it?
c25831	Do you not
c25832	possess whatever your god Chemosh
c25833	grants you?
c25834	So also, ... whatever
c25835	we possess ... the LORD our God ... us.
c25836	has granted
c25837	now
c25838	Are you ... so much better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab?
c25839	Did he ever contend with Israel
c25840	or fight against them?
c25841	Israel has lived in Heshbon, Aroer, and their villages, as well as all the cities
c25842	along the banks of the Arnon.
c25843	For three hundred years
c25844	Why did you not take them back during that time?
c25845	I have not sinned against you,
c25846	but you have done me wrong
c25847	by waging war against me.
c25848	May the LORD, the Judge, decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites.”
c25849	But the king of the Ammonites paid no heed to the message Jephthah
c25850	sent him.
c25851	Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah,
c25852	and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh,
c25853	then through Mizpah of Gilead.
c25854	And from [there] he advanced against the Ammonites.
c25855	Jephthah made this vow to the LORD:
c25857	“If indeed You will deliver the Ammonites into my hands,
c25858	will belong to
c25859	comes out
c25860	then whatever ... of the door of my house
c25861	to greet me
c25862	on my triumphant return from the Ammonites
c25863	the LORD,
c25864	and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.”
c25865	So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites
c25866	to fight against them,
c25867	and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
c25868	he devastated ... from Aroer
c25869	to the vicinity of Minnith,
c25870	With a great blow ... twenty cities ... as far as Abel-keramim.
c25871	So the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites.
c25872	And when Jephthah returned home to Mizpah,
c25873	there was his daughter coming out
c25874	to meet him with tambourines and dancing!
c25875	She was his only child;
c25876	he had no son or daughter besides her.
c25877	As soon as
c25878	[Jephthah] saw her,
c25879	he tore his clothes
c25880	and said,
c25881	“No! Not my daughter!
c25882	You have brought me to my knees!
c25883	You have brought great misery upon me,
c25884	for I have given my word to the LORD
c25885	and cannot
c25886	take it back.”
c25887	she replied,
c25888	“My father,”
c25889	“you have given your word to the LORD.
c25890	Do
c25891	to me as you have said,
c25892	for the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.”
c25893	She also said to her father,
c25894	“Let me do this one thing:
c25895	for two months
c25896	Let me wander
c25897	through the mountains
c25898	with my friends and mourn my virginity.”
c25899	he said.
c25900	“Go,”
c25901	And he sent her away for two months.
c25902	So she left with her friends
c25903	and mourned her virginity upon the mountains.
c25904	After two months,
c25905	she returned to her father,
c25906	and he did to her
c25907	as he had vowed.
c25908	And she had never had relations with a man.
c25909	So it has become a custom in Israel
c25910	that each year the young women of Israel go out
c25911	for four days to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
c25912	Then the men of Ephraim assembled
c25913	and crossed [the Jordan] to Zaphon.
c25914	They said to Jephthah,
c25915	“Why have you crossed over
c25916	to fight the Ammonites
c25917	without calling
c25918	us to go with you?
c25919	We will burn your house down with you inside!”
c25920	But Jephthah replied,
c25921	“My people and I had a serious conflict with the Ammonites,
c25922	and when I called,
c25923	you did not deliver me out of their hands.
c25924	When I saw
c25925	that you would not deliver me,
c25926	I risked my life
c25927	and crossed over to the Ammonites,
c25928	and the LORD delivered them into my hand.
c25929	Why then have you come today
c25930	to fight against me?”
c25931	Then Jephthah gathered all of the men of Gilead
c25932	and fought against Ephraim.
c25933	And the men of Gilead struck them down ... the Ephraimites
c25934	because ... had said,
c25935	“You ... are fugitives in Ephraim,
c25936	Gileadites
c25937	living in the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh.”
c25938	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim,
c25939	and
c25940	whenever a fugitive from Ephraim would say,
c25941	“Let me cross over,”
c25942	the Gileadites would ask him,
c25943	“Are you an Ephraimite?”
c25944	If he answered,
c25945	“No,”
c25946	they told him,
c25947	“Please say
c25948	Shibboleth.”
c25949	If he said,
c25950	“Sibboleth,”
c25951	because he could not
c25952	pronounce it correctly,
c25953	they seized
c25954	him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan.
c25955	So at that time 42,000 Ephraimites were killed.
c25956	Jephthah judged Israel six years,
c25957	and when he died,
c25958	he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
c25959	After Jephthah, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
c25960	He had thirty sons, as well as thirty daughters
c25961	whom he gave in marriage to men outside his clan;
c25962	and for his sons he brought back thirty wives from elsewhere.
c25963	Ibzan judged Israel seven years.
c25964	Then Ibzan died,
c25965	and he was buried in Bethlehem.
c25966	After Ibzan, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel
c25967	ten years.
c25968	Then Elon the Zebulunite died,
c25969	and he was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
c25970	After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, judged Israel.
c25971	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons,
c25972	who rode on seventy donkeys.
c25973	And he judged Israel eight years.
c25974	Then Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, died,
c25975	and he was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
c25976	Again the Israelites
c25977	did
c25978	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c25979	so the LORD delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years.
c25980	Now there was a man from Zorah ... from the clan of the Danites,
c25981	named Manoah,
c25982	whose wife [was] barren
c25983	and had no children.
c25984	The Angel of the LORD appeared to the woman
c25985	and said to her,
c25986	“It is true that you are barren
c25987	and have no children;
c25988	but you will conceive
c25989	and give birth to a son.
c25990	Now please be careful
c25991	not to drink wine or strong drink,
c25992	and not to eat anything unclean.
c25993	For behold, you will conceive
c25994	and give birth to a son.
c25995	And no razor shall come over his head,
c25996	because the boy will be a Nazirite, set apart to God from the womb,
c25997	and he will begin
c25998	the deliverance of Israel from the hands of the Philistines.”
c25999	Then the woman went
c26000	and said to her husband,
c26002	“A Man of God came to me.
c26003	His appearance was like the Angel of God,
c26004	exceedingly awesome.
c26005	I did not ask
c26006	Him where He came from,
c26007	and He did not tell me His name.
c26008	But He said to me,
c26009	‘Behold, you will conceive
c26010	and give birth to a son.
c26011	Now, therefore,
c26012	do not drink wine or strong drink,
c26013	and do not eat anything unclean,
c26014	because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.’”
c26015	Then Manoah prayed to the LORD,
c26017	“Please, O Lord,
c26018	let the Man of God
c26019	You sent us
c26020	come to us again
c26021	to teach us
c26022	how to raise the boy
c26023	who is to be born.”
c26024	And God listened to the voice of Manoah,
c26025	and the Angel of God returned to the woman
c26026	as she was sitting in the field;
c26027	but her husband Manoah was not with her.
c26028	quickly ... her husband,
c26029	ran
c26030	The woman
c26031	to tell ... to me
c26032	“Behold, the Man ... has reappeared!”
c26033	who came ... the [other] day
c26034	got up
c26035	So Manoah ... and followed his wife.
c26036	When he came to the Man,
c26037	he asked,
c26038	“Are You the Man
c26039	who spoke to my wife?”
c26040	am, ” He said.
c26041	“I
c26042	Then Manoah asked,
c26043	“When Your words come to pass,
c26044	what will be the boy’s rule of life and mission?”
c26045	So the Angel of the LORD answered Manoah,
c26046	everything
c26047	“Your wife ... I told her.
c26048	needs to do
c26049	anything
c26050	that comes from the vine
c26051	She is not to eat
c26052	or drink wine or strong drink. And she must not
c26053	eat anything unclean.
c26054	everything
c26055	I have commanded her.”
c26056	Your wife must do
c26057	Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD,
c26058	“Please stay here,”
c26059	“and we will prepare a young goat for You.”
c26060	And the Angel of the LORD replied,
c26061	“Even if I stay,
c26062	I will not eat your food.
c26063	But if you prepare a burnt offering,
c26064	offer it to the LORD.”
c26065	For Manoah did not know
c26066	He was the Angel of the LORD.
c26067	Then Manoah said to Him,
c26068	“What is Your name,
c26069	You when Your word comes to pass?”
c26070	so that we may honor
c26071	said the Angel of the LORD,
c26072	“Why do you ask My name,”
c26073	“since it is beyond comprehension?”
c26074	Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering
c26075	and offered them on a rock to the LORD,
c26076	a marvelous thing.
c26077	the LORD did
c26078	and as Manoah and his wife looked on,
c26080	When the flame went up from the altar to the sky,
c26081	the Angel of the LORD ascended in the flame.
c26082	When Manoah and his wife saw [this],
c26083	they fell facedown to the ground.
c26084	And when the Angel of the LORD did not ... again
c26085	appear ... to Manoah and his wife,
c26086	Manoah realized
c26087	that it was the Angel of the LORD.
c26088	he said to his wife,
c26089	“We are going to die,”
c26090	“for we have seen God!”
c26091	But his wife replied,
c26092	“If the LORD had intended
c26093	to kill us,
c26094	He would not have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from our hands,
c26095	nor would He have shown us all these things
c26096	or spoken to us this way.”
c26097	So the woman gave birth to a son
c26098	and named him Samson.
c26099	The boy grew,
c26100	and the LORD blessed him.
c26101	And the Spirit of the LORD began
c26102	to stir him at Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
c26103	One day Samson went down to Timnah,
c26104	where he saw a young Philistine woman.
c26105	So he returned
c26106	and told his father and his mother,
c26108	“I have seen a daughter of the Philistines in Timnah.
c26109	Now get her for me as a wife.”
c26110	But his father and mother replied,
c26111	“Can you not find a young woman among your relatives or any of our people?
c26112	Must you go
c26113	to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?”
c26114	But Samson told his father,
c26115	“Get her for me,
c26116	for she is pleasing to my eyes.”
c26117	(Now his father and mother did not know
c26118	this ... the LORD,
c26119	was from ... who was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines;
c26120	for at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.)
c26121	Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother
c26122	and came to the vineyards of Timnah.
c26123	Suddenly a young lion came roaring
c26124	at him,
c26125	and the Spirit of the LORD took control of him,
c26126	and he tore the lion apart
c26127	as one would tear a young goat.
c26128	with his bare hands
c26129	But he did not tell his father or mother
c26130	what he had done.
c26131	Then [Samson] continued on his way down
c26132	and spoke to the woman,
c26133	because [he] wanted her.
c26134	When [Samson] returned later
c26135	to take her,
c26136	he left
c26137	the road to see the lion’s carcass,
c26138	and in [it] was a swarm of bees,
c26139	along with their honey.
c26140	So he scooped some honey into his hands
c26141	and ate it as he went along.
c26142	When he returned to his father and mother,
c26143	he gave some to them
c26144	and they ate it.
c26145	But he did not tell them
c26146	that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass.
c26147	Then his father went to visit the woman,
c26148	and Samson prepared a feast there,
c26149	as was customary for the bridegroom.
c26150	And when
c26151	[the Philistines] saw him,
c26152	they selected thirty men to accompany him.
c26154	Samson said to them.
c26155	“Let me tell you a riddle,”
c26156	“If you can solve it for me [within the] seven days of the feast,
c26158	I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.
c26159	But if you cannot
c26160	solve it,
c26161	you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.”
c26162	they replied.
c26163	“Tell us your riddle,”
c26164	“Let us hear it.”
c26165	So he said to them:
c26166	“Out of the eater came something to eat,
c26167	and out of the strong came something sweet.”
c26168	they were unable
c26169	to explain the riddle.
c26170	For three days
c26171	So on the fourth day
c26172	they said to Samson’s wife,
c26173	“Entice your husband
c26174	to explain the riddle to us,
c26175	or we will burn you and your father’s household to death.
c26176	to rob us?”
c26177	Did you invite us here
c26179	Then Samson’s wife came to him, weeping,
c26180	and said,
c26181	“You hate me!
c26182	You do not really love me!
c26183	You have posed to my people a riddle,
c26184	but have not explained it to me.”
c26185	he said,
c26186	“Look,” ... “I have not even explained it to my father or mother,
c26187	so why should I explain it to you?”
c26188	She wept the whole seven days
c26189	of the feast,
c26190	and finally on the seventh day,
c26191	he told her [the answer].
c26192	because she had pressed him so much,
c26193	And in turn she explained the riddle to her people.
c26194	on the seventh day, the men of the city said to [Samson]:
c26195	Before sunset
c26196	“What is sweeter than honey?
c26197	And what [is] stronger than a lion?”
c26198	So he said to them:
c26199	“If you had not plowed with my heifer,
c26200	you would not have solved my riddle!”
c26201	Then the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him,
c26202	and he went down to Ashkelon,
c26203	killed thirty of their men,
c26204	took their apparel,
c26205	and gave their clothes to those who had solved the riddle.
c26206	And burning with anger,
c26207	Samson returned to his father’s house,
c26208	and his wife was given
c26209	to one of the men who had accompanied him.
c26210	Later on, at the time of the wheat harvest,
c26211	Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife.
c26212	he said.
c26213	“I want to go to my wife in her room,”
c26214	But her father would not let
c26215	him enter.
c26216	“I was sure ... her father,
c26217	said
c26218	you thoroughly hated her,”
c26219	“so I gave her to one of the men who accompanied you.
c26220	Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she?
c26221	Please take her instead.”
c26222	Samson said to them,
c26223	“This time I will be blameless ... to the Philistines.”
c26224	in doing harm
c26225	Then Samson went out
c26226	and caught three hundred foxes.
c26227	And he took torches,
c26228	turned the foxes tail-to-tail,
c26229	and fastened a torch between each pair of tails.
c26230	Then he lit the torches
c26231	and released [the foxes] into the standing grain of the Philistines,
c26232	burning up the piles of grain and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.
c26233	the Philistines demanded.
c26234	“Who did this?”
c26235	they were told.
c26236	“It was Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite,”
c26237	“For his wife
c26238	was given to his companion.”
c26239	So the Philistines went up
c26240	and burned her and her father to death.
c26241	And Samson told them,
c26242	“Because you have done this,
c26243	until I have taken vengeance upon you.”
c26244	I will not rest
c26245	And he struck them ruthlessly
c26246	with a great slaughter,
c26247	and then went down
c26248	and stayed in the cave at the rock of Etam.
c26249	Then the Philistines went up,
c26250	camped in Judah,
c26251	and deployed themselves against Lehi.
c26252	said the men of Judah.
c26253	“Why have you attacked us?”
c26254	The Philistines replied,
c26255	to arrest Samson
c26256	“We have come
c26257	and pay him back
c26258	for what he has done to us.”
c26259	In response, three thousand men of Judah went to the cave at the rock of Etam,
c26260	and they asked Samson,
c26261	“Do you not realize
c26262	that the Philistines rule over us?
c26263	What have you done to us?”
c26264	he replied.
c26265	“I have done to them what
c26266	they did to me,”
c26267	But they said to him,
c26268	to arrest you
c26269	“We have come down
c26270	and hand you over to the Philistines.”
c26271	Samson replied,
c26272	“Swear to me
c26273	that you will not kill me {yourselves}.”
c26274	they answered,
c26276	“No,”
c26277	but we will tie you up securely
c26278	and hand you over to them.”
c26279	“we will not kill you,
c26280	So they bound him with two new ropes
c26281	and led him up from the rock.
c26282	When [Samson] arrived in Lehi,
c26283	the Philistines came out shouting
c26284	against him.
c26285	And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him.
c26286	The ropes ... became
c26287	on his arms
c26288	flax,
c26289	like burnt
c26290	and the bonds broke loose from his hands.
c26291	He found the fresh jawbone of a donkey,
c26292	reached out his hand
c26293	and took it,
c26294	and struck down a thousand men.
c26295	Then Samson said:
c26296	“With the jawbone of a donkey I have piled them into heaps.
c26297	With the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men.”
c26298	And
c26299	when [Samson] had finished
c26300	speaking,
c26301	he cast the jawbone from his hand;
c26302	and he named that place Ramath-lehi.
c26303	And being very thirsty,
c26304	[Samson] cried out to the LORD,
c26306	“You have accomplished this great deliverance through Your servant.
c26307	Must I now die of thirst
c26308	and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”
c26309	So God opened up the hollow place
c26310	in Lehi
c26311	and water came out of it.
c26312	When Samson drank,
c26313	his strength returned,
c26314	and he was revived.
c26315	That is why he named it En-hakkore,
c26316	in Lehi, ... and it remains
c26317	to this day.
c26318	And [Samson] judged Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
c26319	One day Samson went to Gaza,
c26320	where he saw a prostitute
c26321	and went in to spend the night with her.
c26322	When the Gazites
c26324	heard that Samson was there,
c26325	they surrounded [that place]
c26326	and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate.
c26327	They were quiet throughout the night,
c26328	saying,
c26329	“Let us wait until dawn;
c26330	then we will kill him.”
c26331	But Samson lay there only until midnight.
c26332	Then he got up
c26333	and took hold of the doors of the city gate, along with the two gateposts,
c26334	and pulled them out, bar and all.
c26335	Then he put [them] on his shoulders
c26336	and took them to the top of the mountain
c26337	overlooking Hebron.
c26338	Some time later,
c26339	[Samson] fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek,
c26340	whose name was Delilah.
c26341	The lords of the Philistines went to her
c26342	and said,
c26343	“Entice him
c26344	and find out
c26345	the source of his great strength
c26346	and how we can overpower him
c26347	to tie him up
c26348	and subdue him.
c26349	Then each one of us will give you eleven hundred [shekels] of silver.”
c26350	So Delilah said to Samson,
c26351	“Please tell me
c26352	the source of your great strength
c26353	and how you could be tied up
c26354	and subdued.”
c26355	Samson told her,
c26356	“If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings
c26357	that have not been dried,
c26358	I will become as weak
c26359	as any other man.”
c26360	So the lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings
c26361	that had not been dried,
c26362	and she bound him with them.
c26363	While the men were hidden in her room,
c26364	she called out,
c26365	the Philistines [are] here!”
c26366	“Samson,
c26367	But he snapped the bowstrings
c26368	like a strand of yarn breaks
c26369	when it touches the flame.
c26370	So the source of his strength remained unknown.
c26371	Then Delilah said to Samson,
c26372	“You have mocked me
c26373	and lied to me!
c26374	Will you now please tell
c26375	me how you can be bound?”
c26376	He replied,
c26377	“If they tie me up with new ropes
c26378	that have never been used,
c26379	I will become as weak
c26380	as any other man.”
c26381	So Delilah took new ropes,
c26382	tied him up,
c26383	and called out,
c26384	the Philistines are here!”
c26385	“Samson,
c26386	But while the men were hidden in her room,
c26387	he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.
c26388	Then Delilah said to Samson,
c26389	“You have mocked me ... all along!
c26390	and lied to me
c26391	Tell
c26392	me how you can be tied up.”
c26393	He told her,
c26394	“If you weave the seven braids of my head into the web of a loom [and fasten it with a pin, I will become as weak as any other man.]”
c26395	[So while he slept, Delilah took the seven braids of his hair and wove them into the web]. Then she fastened the braids with a pin
c26396	and called to him,
c26397	the Philistines [are] here!”
c26398	“Samson,
c26399	But he awoke from his sleep
c26400	and pulled out the pin with the loom and the web.
c26401	can you say,
c26402	“How ... she told him,
c26403	‘I love you,’”
c26404	“when your heart is not with me?
c26405	This is the third time you have mocked
c26406	me and failed to reveal to me
c26407	the source of your great strength!”
c26408	Finally, after
c26409	she had pressed him daily with her words
c26410	and pleaded
c26411	until he was sick
c26412	to death,
c26413	he told her all that was in his heart:
c26415	“My hair has never been cut,
c26416	because I [have been] a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb.
c26417	If I am shaved,
c26418	my strength will leave me,
c26419	and I will become as weak
c26420	as any other man.”
c26421	When Delilah realized
c26422	that he had revealed to her his whole heart,
c26423	she sent
c26424	to the lords of the Philistines:
c26425	this message
c26426	“Come up once more,
c26427	for he has revealed to me his whole heart.”
c26428	Then the lords of the Philistines came to her,
c26429	bringing the money in their hands.
c26430	And having lulled him to sleep on her lap,
c26431	she called a man
c26432	to shave off the seven braids of his head.
c26433	In this way
c26434	she began to subdue him,
c26435	and his strength left him.
c26436	Then she called out,
c26437	the Philistines [are] here!”
c26438	“Samson,
c26439	When [Samson] awoke from his sleep,
c26440	he thought,
c26441	“I will escape as I did before
c26442	and shake myself free.”
c26443	But he did not know
c26444	that the LORD had departed from him.
c26445	Then the Philistines seized him,
c26446	gouged out his eyes,
c26447	and brought him down to Gaza,
c26448	where he was bound with bronze shackles
c26449	and forced to grind grain in the prison.
c26450	However, the hair of his head began
c26451	to grow
c26452	back after it had been shaved.
c26453	Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together
c26454	to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon.
c26455	They rejoiced
c26456	and said,
c26457	“Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands.”
c26458	And when the people saw him,
c26459	they praised their god,
c26460	saying:
c26461	“Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy who destroyed our land
c26462	and multiplied our dead.”
c26463	And
c26464	while their hearts were merry,
c26465	they said,
c26466	“Call for Samson
c26467	to entertain us.”
c26468	So they called Samson out of the prison
c26469	to entertain them.
c26470	And they stationed him between the pillars.
c26471	Samson said to the servant
c26472	who held his hand,
c26473	“Lead me
c26474	where I can feel the pillars
c26475	supporting the temple, ... against them.”
c26476	so I can lean
c26477	Now the temple was full of ... and women;
c26478	all the lords of the Philistines were there,
c26479	men ... and about three thousand men and women were on the roof
c26480	watching
c26481	Samson entertain them.
c26482	Then Samson called out to ... GOD,
c26484	the LORD: “O Lord
c26485	please remember me.
c26486	Strengthen me, ... just once more,
c26487	O God,
c26488	so that with one vengeful blow I may pay back the Philistines for my two eyes.”
c26489	And Samson reached out for the two central pillars
c26490	supporting the temple. ... against them
c26491	Bracing himself
c26492	with his right hand on one
c26493	and his left hand on the other,
c26494	Samson said,
c26495	“Let me die with the Philistines.”
c26496	Then he pushed with all his might,
c26497	and the temple fell on the lords and all the people in it.
c26500	So in his death he killed
c26501	more
c26502	than he had killed in his life.
c26503	Then [Samson's] brothers and his father’s family came down,
c26505	carried him back,
c26506	and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah.
c26507	And he had judged Israel twenty years.
c26508	Now there was a man from the hill country of Ephraim
c26509	named Micah.
c26510	He said to his mother,
c26511	“The eleven hundred [shekels] of silver
c26512	that were taken from you
c26513	you utter a curse—
c26514	and about which I heard ... said,
c26515	I have the silver {here} with me;
c26516	I took it.”
c26517	Then his mother
c26518	“Blessed be my son by the LORD!”
c26519	And when he had returned the eleven hundred [shekels] of silver to his mother,
c26520	[she] said,
c26521	“I wholly dedicate the silver to the LORD for my son’s
c26522	benefit to make a graven image and a molten idol.
c26523	Therefore I will now return it to you.”
c26524	So he returned the silver to his mother,
c26525	and she took two hundred [shekels] of silver
c26526	and gave them to a silversmith,
c26527	who made them into a graven image and a molten idol.
c26528	And they were placed in the house of Micah.
c26529	Now this man Micah
c26530	had a shrine,
c26531	and he made an ephod and some household idols,
c26532	and installed one of his sons
c26533	to be his priest.
c26534	In those days there was no king in Israel;
c26535	everyone
c26536	right in his own eyes.
c26537	did [what was]
c26538	And there was a young ... from Bethlehem in Judah, ... within the clan of Judah.
c26539	Levite ... who
c26540	had been residing
c26541	This man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah
c26542	to settle
c26543	where he could find [a place].
c26544	he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim.
c26545	And as he traveled,
c26546	Micah asked him.
c26547	“Where are you from?”
c26548	he replied,
c26549	“I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,”
c26550	“and I am on my way
c26551	to settle
c26552	wherever I can find a place.”
c26553	Micah said to him,
c26554	“Stay with me,”
c26555	“and be my father and priest,
c26556	and I will give you ten [shekels] of silver per year, a suit of clothes, and your provisions.”
c26557	So the Levite went in
c26558	and agreed
c26559	to stay with [him],
c26560	and the young man became like a son to Micah.
c26561	Micah ordained the Levite,
c26562	and the young man became his priest
c26563	and lived in [his] house.
c26564	Then Micah said,
c26565	“Now I know
c26566	that the LORD will be good to me,
c26567	because a Levite has become my priest.”
c26568	In those days there was no king in Israel,
c26569	[and] the tribe of the Danites was looking for territory ... time
c26570	to occupy.
c26571	For up to that ... they had not come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
c26572	So the Danites sent out five men from their clans, valiant warriors from Zorah and Eshtaol,
c26573	to spy out the land
c26574	and explore it.
c26575	they told them.
c26576	“Go
c26577	and explore the land,”
c26578	[The men] entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah,
c26579	where they spent the night.
c26580	And while they were near Micah’s house,
c26581	they recognized the voice of the young Levite;
c26582	so they went over
c26583	and asked him,
c26584	“Who brought you here?
c26585	What are you doing in this [place]?
c26586	Why are you here?”
c26587	he replied,
c26588	“Micah had done this for me,”
c26589	“and he has hired me
c26590	to be his priest.”
c26591	Then they said to him,
c26592	“Please inquire of God
c26593	to determine
c26594	will have a successful journey.”
c26595	whether we
c26596	And the priest told them,
c26597	“Go in peace.
c26598	The LORD is watching over your journey.”
c26600	So the five men departed
c26601	and came to Laish,
c26602	where they saw that the people
c26604	were living securely, like the Sidonians, tranquil and unsuspecting.
c26605	There was nothing lacking in the land
c26606	and no oppressive ruler.
c26607	And they were far away from the Sidonians
c26608	and had no alliance with anyone.
c26609	When the men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol,
c26610	their brothers asked them,
c26611	“What did you find?”
c26612	They answered,
c26613	“Come on,
c26614	let us go up against them,
c26615	for we have seen the land,
c26616	and it is very good.
c26617	Why would you fail to act?
c26618	Do not hesitate
c26619	to go there
c26621	and take possession of the land!
c26622	When you enter,
c26623	you will come to an unsuspecting people
c26624	and a spacious land,
c26625	for God has given it into your hands. It is a place
c26626	where nothing ... is lacking.”
c26627	on earth
c26628	So six hundred Danites departed from Zorah and Eshtaol,
c26629	armed with weapons of war.
c26630	They went up
c26631	and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah.
c26632	That is why the place ... is called Mahaneh-dan to this day.
c26633	west of Kiriath-jearim
c26634	And from there they traveled to the hill country of Ephraim
c26635	and came to Micah’s house.
c26636	Then the five men
c26637	who had gone
c26638	to spy out the land of Laish
c26639	said to their brothers,
c26640	“Did you know
c26641	that one of these houses has an ephod, household gods, a graven image, and a molten idol?
c26642	Now think about
c26643	what you should do.”
c26644	So they turned aside there
c26645	and went to the home of the young Levite, the house of Micah,
c26646	and greeted him.
c26647	The six hundred ... men
c26648	armed with their weapons of war,
c26649	stood at the entrance of the gate,
c26650	Danite
c26651	while the five men
c26652	who had gone
c26653	to scout out the land
c26654	went inside
c26655	and took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten idol,
c26656	while the priest stood at the entrance of the gate
c26657	with the six hundred ... men.
c26658	armed
c26659	When they entered Micah’s house
c26660	and took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten idol,
c26661	the priest said to them,
c26662	“What are you doing?”
c26663	they told him.
c26664	“Be quiet,”
c26665	“Put your hand over your mouth
c26666	and come with us
c26667	and be a father and a priest to us.
c26668	Is it better
c26669	for you to be a priest for the house of one person
c26670	or a priest for a tribe and family in Israel?”
c26671	So the priest was glad
c26672	and took the ephod, the household idols, and the graven image,
c26673	and went with the people.
c26674	they turned
c26675	and departed.
c26676	Putting their small children, their livestock, and their possessions in front of them,
c26677	After they were some distance from Micah’s house,
c26678	the men
c26679	in the houses
c26680	near Micah's house
c26681	mobilized
c26682	and overtook the Danites.
c26683	When they called out after them, the Danites
c26684	turned to face them
c26685	and said to Micah,
c26686	“What is the matter
c26687	with you that you have called out such a company?”
c26688	He replied,
c26689	the gods
c26690	I had made,
c26691	“You took
c26692	and my priest,
c26693	and went away.
c26694	What else do I have?
c26695	How can you say to me,
c26696	‘What is the matter with you?’”
c26697	The Danites said to him,
c26698	“Do not raise your voice against us,
c26699	or angry men will attack you,
c26700	and you and your family will lose your lives.”
c26701	So the Danites went on their way,
c26702	because he saw
c26703	that they were too strong for him.
c26704	and Micah turned
c26705	to go back home,
c26706	After they had taken
c26707	Micah's [idols]
c26708	and his priest,
c26710	they went to Laish, to a tranquil and unsuspecting people,
c26711	and they struck them with their swords
c26712	and burned down the city.
c26713	There was no one to deliver them,
c26714	because [the city was] far from Sidon
c26715	and had no alliance with anyone;
c26716	it was in a valley
c26717	near Beth-rehob.
c26718	And the Danites rebuilt the city
c26719	and lived there.
c26720	They named [it] Dan, after their forefather Dan,
c26721	who was born to Israel—
c26722	though the city was formerly named Laish.
c26723	The Danites set up idols for themselves,
c26724	and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses,
c26725	and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the day
c26726	of the captivity of the land.
c26727	So they set up for themselves Micah's graven image,
c26729	and it was there the whole time
c26730	the house of God was in Shiloh.
c26731	In those days,
c26732	when there was no king in Israel,
c26733	a Levite who lived in the remote hill country of Ephraim
c26734	took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
c26735	But she was unfaithful to him
c26736	and left him to return to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah.
c26737	After she had been there four months,
c26738	her husband got up
c26739	and went after her
c26740	to speak kindly to her
c26741	and bring her back,
c26742	taking with him his servant and a pair of donkeys.
c26743	So [the girl] brought him into her father's house,
c26744	and when [her] father saw him,
c26745	he gladly
c26746	welcomed him.
c26747	His father-in-law, the girl’s father, persuaded him to stay,
c26748	so he remained with him three days,
c26749	eating,
c26750	drinking,
c26751	and lodging there.
c26752	On the fourth day,
c26753	they got up early in the morning
c26754	and prepared
c26755	to go,
c26756	but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law,
c26757	“Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread,
c26758	and then you can go.”
c26759	So they sat down
c26760	and the two of them ate ... together.
c26761	and drank
c26762	Then the girl’s father said to the man,
c26763	“Please agree
c26764	to stay overnight
c26765	and let your heart be merry.”
c26766	The man got up
c26767	to go,
c26768	but his father-in-law persuaded him,
c26770	so he stayed there that night.
c26771	On the fifth day, he got up early in the morning
c26772	to leave,
c26773	but the girl’s father said,
c26774	“Please refresh your heart.”
c26775	So they waited
c26776	until late afternoon
c26777	and the two of them ate.
c26778	When the man got up
c26779	to depart
c26780	with his concubine and his servant,
c26781	his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him,
c26782	“Look, the day is drawing ... Please
c26783	late.
c26784	spend the night.
c26785	See, the day is almost over.
c26786	Spend the night here,
c26787	that your heart may be merry.
c26788	Then you can get up early tomorrow for your journey
c26789	and go home.”
c26790	But the man was unwilling
c26791	to spend the night.
c26792	He got up
c26793	and departed,
c26794	and arrived opposite Jebus
c26795	(that is, Jerusalem),
c26796	with his two saddled donkeys
c26797	and his concubine.
c26798	When they were near Jebus
c26799	and the day was almost gone,
c26800	the servant said to his master,
c26801	“Please,
c26802	let us stop at this Jebusite city
c26803	and spend the night here.”
c26804	But his master replied,
c26805	“We will not turn aside to the city of foreigners,
c26806	where there are no Israelites.
c26807	We will go on to Gibeah.”
c26808	He continued,
c26809	“Come,
c26810	let us try to reach one of these towns
c26811	to spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah.”
c26812	on their journey,
c26813	So they continued
c26814	and the sun set as they neared Gibeah
c26815	in Benjamin.
c26816	They stopped
c26817	to go in
c26818	and lodge in Gibeah.
c26819	The Levite went in
c26820	and sat down in the city square,
c26821	but no one would take them into his home
c26822	for the night.
c26823	That evening an old man ... came in from his work in the field.
c26824	from the hill country of Ephraim,
c26825	who was residing in Gibeah
c26826	(the men of that place were Benjamites)
c26827	When he looked up
c26828	and saw the traveler in the city square, ... man
c26829	the old ... asked,
c26830	“Where are you going,
c26831	and where have you come from?”
c26832	[The Levite] replied,
c26833	“We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote hill country of Ephraim,
c26834	where I am from.
c26835	I went to Bethlehem in Judah,
c26836	and now I am going to the house of the LORD;
c26837	but no one has taken me into his home,
c26838	even though there is both straw and feed for our donkeys,
c26839	and bread and wine for me and the maidservant and young man with me. ... we, your servants,
c26840	There is nothing that ... lack.”
c26841	said the old man.
c26842	“Peace to you,”
c26843	“Let me supply everything you need. Only
c26844	do not spend the night in the square.”
c26845	So he brought him to his house
c26846	and fed his donkeys.
c26847	And they washed their feet
c26848	and ate
c26849	and drank.
c26850	While they were enjoying themselves,
c26851	suddenly the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. ... man
c26852	Pounding on the door,
c26853	they said to the old ... who owned the house, ... the man
c26855	“Bring out
c26856	who came to your house
c26857	so we can have relations with him!”
c26858	The owner of the house went out ... to them, ... man
c26859	and said ... in
c26860	“No,
c26861	my brothers,
c26862	do not do this wicked thing!
c26863	After all, this ... is a guest ... my house.
c26864	Do not commit this outrage.
c26865	Look, ... my virgin daughter and the man’s concubine,
c26866	let me bring out
c26867	and you can use them
c26868	and do with them
c26869	as you wish.
c26870	But do not do such a vile thing to this man.”
c26871	would not
c26872	listen to him. So [the man]
c26873	But the men ... took his concubine
c26874	and sent her outside to them,
c26875	and they raped her
c26876	and abused her throughout the night,
c26877	they let her go.
c26878	and at dawn
c26879	the woman went back
c26880	Early that morning,
c26881	to the house ... collapsed at the doorway,
c26882	where her master was staying,
c26883	and lay there until it was light.
c26884	In the morning, when her master got up
c26885	and opened the doors of the house
c26886	to go out
c26887	on his journey,
c26888	there was his concubine, collapsed in the doorway of the house,
c26889	with her hands on the threshold.
c26890	he told her.
c26891	“Get up,”
c26892	“Let us go.”
c26893	But there was no response.
c26894	put her on his donkey
c26895	So the man ... and set out
c26896	for home.
c26897	When he reached his house,
c26898	he picked up a knife,
c26899	took hold of his concubine,
c26900	cut her limb by limb into twelve pieces,
c26901	and sent her throughout the territory of Israel.
c26902	or done
c26903	And everyone
c26904	who saw
c26905	it said,
c26906	“Nothing
c26907	like this has been seen ... from the day
c26908	the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt
c26909	until this day.
c26910	Think it over,
c26911	take counsel,
c26912	and speak up!”
c26913	Then all the Israelites ... came out,
c26914	from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead ... and the congregation assembled as one man before the LORD at Mizpah.
c26915	The leaders of all the people and all the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of God’s people:
c26916	400,000 men on foot,
c26917	armed with swords.
c26918	(Now the Benjamites heard
c26919	that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.)
c26920	And the Israelites asked,
c26921	“Tell
c26922	us, how did this wicked thing happen?”
c26923	So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered:
c26925	to Gibeah
c26926	in Benjamin
c26927	“I and my concubine came
c26928	to spend the night.
c26929	the men of Gibeah rose up against me
c26930	And during the night, ... and surrounded the house.
c26931	They intended
c26932	to kill me,
c26933	but they raped my concubine,
c26934	and she died.
c26935	Then I took my concubine,
c26936	cut her into pieces,
c26937	and sent her throughout the land of Israel's inheritance,
c26938	because they had committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.
c26939	Behold, all you Israelites,
c26940	give your advice and verdict here and now.”
c26941	Then all the people stood as one man
c26942	and said,
c26943	“Not one of us will return
c26944	to his tent
c26945	[or]
c26946	to his house.
c26947	Now
c26948	this
c26949	is what we will do to Gibeah:
c26950	We will go against it as the lot dictates.
c26951	We will take ten men out of [every] hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of [every] thousand, and a thousand out of [every] ten thousand,
c26952	to supply provisions for the army
c26953	to punish
c26954	when they go to Gibeah in Benjamin
c26955	them for all the vileness
c26956	they have committed in Israel.”
c26957	So all the men of Israel gathered ... against the city.
c26958	as one man, united
c26959	And the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin,
c26960	saying,
c26961	“What is this wickedness
c26962	that has occurred among you?
c26964	Hand over the wicked men ... But the Benjamites
c26965	of Gibeah
c26966	so we can put them to death
c26967	and purge Israel of this wickedness.”
c26968	refused ... Israelites.
c26969	to heed the voice of their fellow
c26970	And from their cities [they] came together at Gibeah
c26971	to go out and fight against the Israelites.
c26972	On that day the Benjamites mobilized 26,000 ... from their cities,
c26973	swordsmen
c26974	in addition to the 700 select men of Gibeah.
c26975	Among all these soldiers there were 700 select left-handers,
c26976	each of whom could sling a stone at a hair
c26977	without missing.
c26978	The Israelites, apart from Benjamin, mustered 400,000
c26979	swordsmen,
c26980	each one an experienced warrior.
c26981	set out,
c26982	went up to Bethel,
c26983	and inquired of God,
c26984	The Israelites
c26985	“Who of us shall go up first to fight against the Benjamites?”
c26986	the LORD replied.
c26987	“Judah will be first,”
c26988	The next morning the Israelites set out
c26989	and camped near Gibeah.
c26990	And the men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin
c26991	and took up their battle positions at Gibeah.
c26992	Then the Benjamites came out of Gibeah
c26993	and cut down 22,000 Israelites on the battlefield that day.
c26994	But the Israelite army took courage
c26995	and again
c26996	took their battle positions in the same place
c26997	where they had arrayed themselves on the first day.
c26998	They went up
c26999	and wept before the LORD until evening,
c27000	inquiring of Him,
c27001	answered,
c27002	“Should we again
c27003	draw near for battle against our brothers the Benjamites?”
c27004	And the LORD
c27005	“Go up against them.”
c27006	On the second day the Israelites advanced against the Benjamites.
c27007	the Benjamites came out
c27008	against them
c27009	That same day ... from Gibeah
c27010	and cut down another 18,000 Israelites,
c27011	all of them armed with swords.
c27012	Then the Israelites, all the people, went up
c27013	to Bethel,
c27014	weeping
c27015	where they sat ... before the LORD.
c27016	That day they fasted until evening
c27017	and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD.
c27018	Then the Israelites inquired of the LORD.
c27019	(In those days, the ark of the covenant of God was there,
c27020	and Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served before it.)
c27021	The Israelites asked,
c27022	“Should we again
c27023	go out to battle against our brothers the Benjamites,
c27024	or should we stop?”
c27025	The LORD answered,
c27026	“Fight,
c27027	for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hands.”
c27028	So Israel set up an ambush around Gibeah.
c27029	On the third day the Israelites went up against the Benjamites
c27030	and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as they had done before.
c27031	The Benjamites came out
c27032	against [them]
c27033	and were drawn away from the city.
c27034	They began
c27035	to attack the people as before, killing ... and on the roads,
c27036	one of which led up to Bethel
c27037	and the other to Gibeah.
c27038	about thirty men of Israel in the fields
c27039	said the Benjamites.
c27040	“We are defeating them as before,”
c27041	But the Israelites said,
c27042	“Let us retreat
c27043	and draw them away from the city onto the roads.”
c27044	So all the men of Israel got up from their places
c27045	and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar,
c27046	and the Israelites in ambush charged from their positions west of Gibeah.
c27047	Then 10,000 ... men ... made a frontal assault against Gibeah,
c27048	select ... from all Israel
c27049	and the battle was fierce.
c27050	But the Benjamites did not realize
c27051	that disaster [was] upon them.
c27052	The LORD defeated Benjamin in the presence of Israel,
c27053	and on that day the Israelites slaughtered 25,100 Benjamites,
c27054	all armed with swords.
c27055	Then the Benjamites realized
c27056	they had been defeated. ... because
c27057	Now the men of Israel had retreated before Benjamin,
c27058	they had confidence in the ambush
c27059	they had set against Gibeah.
c27060	The men in ambush ... suddenly
c27061	rushed ... against Gibeah;
c27062	they advanced
c27063	and put the whole city to the sword.
c27064	The men of Israel had arranged a signal with the men in ambush:
c27065	a great
c27066	When they sent up ... cloud of smoke from the city,
c27067	the men of Israel would turn in the battle.
c27068	When the Benjamites had begun
c27069	to strike them down, killing about thirty men of Israel,
c27070	they said,
c27071	“They are defeated before us as in the first battle.”
c27072	began
c27073	to go up from the city,
c27074	But when the column of smoke
c27075	the Benjamites looked behind them
c27076	and saw
c27077	the whole city going up in smoke.
c27078	Then the men of Israel turned back on them,
c27079	and the men of Benjamin were terrified
c27080	when they realized
c27081	that disaster had come upon them.
c27082	So they fled before the men of Israel toward the wilderness,
c27083	but the battle overtook them,
c27085	and the men coming out of the cities
c27086	struck them down there.
c27087	They surrounded the Benjamites,
c27088	pursued them, and easily
c27089	overtook them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.
c27090	And 18,000 Benjamites fell,
c27091	all valiant warriors.
c27092	Then the Benjamites turned
c27093	and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon,
c27094	and Israel cut down 5,000 men on the roads.
c27095	And they overtook them at Gidom
c27096	and struck down 2,000more.
c27098	Benjamite ... fell,
c27099	25,000
c27100	swordsmen
c27101	That day
c27102	all valiant warriors.
c27103	turned
c27104	But six hundred men ... and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon,
c27105	where they stayed four months.
c27106	And the men of Israel turned back against the other Benjamites
c27107	and struck down with the sword all the cities, including the animals and everything else
c27108	they found.
c27109	And they ... all the cities
c27110	in their path.
c27111	burned down
c27112	Now the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah,
c27113	saying,
c27114	“Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.”
c27115	So the people came to Bethel
c27116	and sat there before God until evening,
c27117	lifting up their voices
c27118	and weeping bitterly.
c27119	they cried out,
c27120	“Why,
c27121	O LORD God of Israel,”
c27122	“has this happened in Israel?
c27123	Today in Israel one tribe is missing!”
c27124	The next day
c27125	the people got up early,
c27126	built an altar there,
c27127	and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings.
c27128	The Israelites asked,
c27129	“Who
c27130	among all the tribes of Israel did not come to the assembly before the LORD?”
c27131	For they had taken a solemn oath
c27132	that anyone who failed to come up before the LORD at Mizpah
c27134	would surely be put to death.
c27135	And the Israelites grieved for their brothers, the Benjamites,
c27136	and said,
c27137	“Today a tribe is cut off from Israel.
c27138	What should we do about wives for the survivors,
c27139	since we have sworn by the LORD
c27140	not to give them our daughters in marriage?”
c27141	So they asked,
c27142	“Which one of the tribes of Israel
c27143	failed to come up before the LORD at Mizpah?”
c27144	And in fact,
c27145	no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.
c27146	For when the people were counted,
c27148	none of the residents of Jabesh-gilead were there.
c27149	So the congregation sent 12,000 of their most valiant men
c27150	and commanded them:
c27152	“Go
c27153	and put to the sword those living in Jabesh-gilead, including women and children.
c27154	This
c27155	is what you are to do:
c27156	every male, as well as every female
c27157	who has had relations with a man.”
c27158	Completely destroy
c27159	So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young women
c27160	who had not had relations with a man,
c27161	and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh
c27162	in the land of Canaan.
c27163	Then the whole congregation sent
c27164	a message ... to the Benjamites
c27165	who were at the rock of Rimmon.
c27166	of peace
c27167	And at that time the Benjamites returned
c27168	and were given the women
c27169	who were spared from Jabesh-gilead.
c27170	But there were not enough [women] for all of them.
c27171	The people grieved for Benjamin,
c27172	because the LORD had made a void in the tribes of Israel.
c27173	Then the elders of the congregation said,
c27174	“What should we do about wives for those who remain,
c27175	since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?”
c27176	They added,
c27177	“There must be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin,
c27178	so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.
c27179	But we cannot
c27180	give them our daughters as wives.”
c27181	For the Israelites had sworn,
c27183	“Cursed [is]
c27184	he who gives a wife to a Benjamite.”
c27185	they said,
c27186	“But look,” ... “there is a yearly feast to the LORD in Shiloh,
c27187	which [is] north of Bethel east of the road
c27188	that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”
c27189	So they commanded the Benjamites:
c27191	“Go,
c27192	hide in the vineyards
c27193	and watch.
c27194	you see
c27195	When ... the daughters of Shiloh come out
c27196	to perform their dances,
c27197	is to come out of the vineyards,
c27198	each of you ... catch for himself a wife from the daughters of Shiloh,
c27199	and go to the land of Benjamin.
c27201	When their fathers or brothers come
c27202	to us to complain,
c27203	we will tell them,
c27204	‘Do us a favor by [helping] them,
c27205	since we did not get wives for each of them in the war.
c27206	Since you did not actually give them [your daughters],
c27207	you have no guilt.’”
c27208	The Benjamites did [as instructed]
c27209	and carried away the number of women they needed from the dancers
c27210	they caught.
c27211	They went
c27212	back to their own inheritance,
c27213	rebuilt their cities,
c27214	and settled in them.
c27215	And at that time, ... of the Israelites returned from there
c27216	each ... to his own tribe and clan,
c27218	each to his own inheritance.
c27219	In those days there was no king in Israel;
c27220	everyone
c27221	right in his own eyes.
c27222	did [what was]
c27223	Now there was a man ... [who was] from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim.
c27224	named Elkanah ... [He was] the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
c27225	He had two wives,
c27226	one named Hannah
c27227	and the other Peninnah.
c27228	had
c27229	And Peninnah ... children,
c27230	but Hannah had none.
c27231	Year after year [Elkanah] would go up from his city
c27232	to worship
c27233	and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts at Shiloh,
c27234	where Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD.
c27235	And whenever the day came
c27236	for Elkanah to present his sacrifice,
c27237	he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.
c27238	But to Hannah he would give a double portion,
c27239	for he loved her
c27240	even though the LORD had closed her womb.
c27241	her rival ... and taunt her severely.
c27242	would provoke her
c27243	Because the LORD had closed [Hannah's] womb,
c27244	And this went on year after year.
c27245	Whenever [Hannah] went up to the house of the LORD,
c27246	her rival taunted her
c27247	until she wept
c27248	and would not eat.
c27249	her husband Elkanah asked.
c27250	“Hannah,
c27251	why are you crying?”
c27252	“Why won't you eat?
c27253	Why is your heart so grieved?
c27254	Am I not better to you than ten sons?”
c27255	Hannah got up.
c27256	So after they had finished eating ... in Shiloh,
c27257	and drinking
c27258	Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.
c27259	In her bitter distress,
c27260	Hannah prayed to the LORD
c27261	and wept with many tears.
c27262	And she made a vow,
c27263	pleading,
c27264	“O LORD of Hosts,
c27265	if only You will look upon the affliction of Your maidservant
c27266	and remember me,
c27267	not forgetting [Your maidservant] ... [her]
c27268	but giving ... a son,
c27269	then I will dedicate him to the LORD all the days of his life,
c27270	and no razor shall ever come over his head.”
c27272	As [Hannah] kept on
c27273	praying before the LORD,
c27274	Eli watched her mouth.
c27275	Hannah
c27276	was praying in her heart,
c27277	and though her lips were moving,
c27278	her voice could not be heard.
c27279	So Eli thought she was drunk
c27280	and said to her,
c27281	“How long will you be drunk?
c27282	Put away your wine!”
c27283	Hannah replied.
c27285	“No,
c27286	my lord,”
c27287	“I am a woman oppressed in spirit.
c27288	I have not had any wine or strong drink,
c27289	but I have poured out my soul before the LORD.
c27290	Do not take your servant for a wicked woman;
c27291	for all this time I have been praying out of the depth of my anguish and grief.”
c27292	Eli replied,
c27294	“Go in peace,”
c27295	“and may the God of Israel grant the petition
c27296	you have asked of Him.”
c27297	said Hannah.
c27298	“May your maidservant find favor with you,”
c27299	Then [she] went on her way,
c27300	eating
c27301	and no longer downcast.
c27302	The next morning Elkanah and Hannah got up early
c27303	to bow in worship before the LORD,
c27304	and then returned
c27305	home to Ramah.
c27306	And Elkanah had relations with his wife Hannah,
c27307	and the LORD remembered her.
c27308	So in the course of time,
c27309	Hannah conceived
c27310	and gave birth to a son.
c27311	She named him Samuel,
c27312	[saying,] “Because I have asked for him from the LORD.”
c27313	Then Elkanah and all his house went up
c27314	to make the annual sacrifice to the LORD and [to fulfill] his vow,
c27315	but Hannah did not go.
c27316	she said to her husband,
c27317	“After the boy is weaned,”
c27318	“I will take
c27319	him to appear before the LORD
c27320	and to stay there always.”
c27321	her husband Elkanah replied,
c27322	“Do
c27323	what you think is best,”
c27324	“and stay
c27325	here until you have weaned him.
c27326	Only may the LORD confirm His word.”
c27327	So Hannah stayed
c27328	and nursed her son
c27329	until she had weaned him.
c27330	[Hannah] took [the boy] with her,
c27331	Once she had weaned him,
c27332	along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine.
c27333	she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.
c27334	Though the boy was still young,
c27335	And when they had slaughtered the bull,
c27336	they brought the boy to Eli.
c27337	said [Hannah],
c27338	“Please, my lord,”
c27339	“as surely as you live,
c27340	my lord,
c27341	I am the woman
c27342	who stood here beside
c27343	you praying to the LORD.
c27344	I prayed for this boy,
c27345	and since the LORD has granted me
c27346	what I asked of Him,
c27347	I now dedicate the boy to the LORD. For as
c27348	long as he lives, he is dedicated to the LORD.”
c27349	So they worshiped the LORD there.
c27350	At that time Hannah prayed:
c27352	“My heart rejoices in the LORD
c27353	in [whom] my horn is exalted.
c27354	My mouth speaks boldly against my enemies,
c27355	for I rejoice in Your salvation.
c27356	There is no one holy like the LORD.
c27357	Indeed, [there is] no one besides You!
c27358	And there is no rock like our God.
c27359	Do not boast
c27360	so proudly,
c27361	or let arrogance come from your mouth,
c27362	for the LORD is a God who knows,
c27363	and by Him actions are weighed.
c27364	The bows of the warriors are broken,
c27365	but the feeble are equipped with strength.
c27366	The well-fed hire themselves out for food,
c27367	but the starving hunger no more.
c27368	The barren woman gives birth to seven,
c27369	but she who has many sons pines away.
c27370	The LORD brings death
c27371	and gives life;
c27372	some He brings down to Sheol,
c27373	and others He raises up.
c27374	The LORD sends poverty
c27375	and wealth;
c27376	He humbles
c27377	and He exalts.
c27378	He raises the poor from the dust
c27379	and lifts the needy from the ash heap.
c27380	He seats [them] among princes
c27381	and bestows on them a throne of honor.
c27382	For the foundations of the earth are the LORD’s,
c27383	and upon them He has set the world.
c27384	He guards the steps of His faithful ones,
c27385	but the wicked perish in darkness;
c27386	for by his own strength shall no man prevail.
c27387	the LORD
c27388	Those who oppose ... will be shattered.
c27389	He will thunder from heaven against them.
c27390	The LORD will judge the ends of the earth
c27391	and will give power to His king.
c27392	He will exalt the horn of His anointed.”
c27393	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah,
c27394	but the boy began ministering to the LORD before Eli the priest.
c27395	Now the sons of Eli were wicked men;
c27396	they had no regard for the LORD
c27397	or for the custom of the priests with the people.
c27398	When any man
c27399	offered a sacrifice,
c27400	the servant of the priest would come
c27401	while the meat was boiling
c27402	with a three-pronged meat fork
c27403	and plunge [it] into the pan or kettle or cauldron or cooking pot.
c27404	whatever
c27405	the meat fork brought up.
c27406	And the priest would claim for himself
c27407	This is how they treated all the Israelites
c27408	who came to Shiloh.
c27409	Even before the fat was burned,
c27410	the servant of the priest would come
c27411	and say to the man who was sacrificing,
c27412	“Give ... some meat
c27413	the priest ... to roast,
c27414	because he will not accept from ... boiled meat,
c27415	you ... but only raw.”
c27416	And [if] any man said to him,
c27417	“The fat must be burned first;
c27418	then you can take
c27419	whatever you want,”
c27420	the servant would reply,
c27422	for you must give [it to me] right now.
c27423	“No, ... If you refuse,
c27424	I will take it by force!”
c27425	Thus the sin of these young men was severe in the sight of the LORD,
c27426	for they {were treating} the LORD’s offering with contempt.
c27427	Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD— a boy
c27428	wearing a linen ephod.
c27429	his mother would make him a little robe
c27430	Each year ... and bring [it] to him
c27431	when she went with her husband
c27432	to offer the annual sacrifice.
c27433	And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife,
c27434	saying,
c27435	“May the LORD give you children by this woman in place of the one
c27436	she dedicated to the LORD.”
c27437	Then they would go home.
c27438	So the LORD attended to Hannah,
c27439	and she conceived
c27440	and gave birth to three sons and two daughters.
c27441	Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.
c27442	Now Eli was very old,
c27443	and he heard about everything
c27444	his sons were doing to all Israel and how
c27445	they were sleeping with the women
c27446	who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
c27447	[Eli] said to [his sons].
c27448	“Why are you doing these things?”
c27449	“I hear about your wicked deeds from all ... people.
c27450	these
c27451	No,
c27452	my sons;
c27453	[it is] not a good report
c27454	I hear
c27455	circulating among the LORD’s people.
c27456	If a man sins against another man,
c27457	God can intercede for him,
c27458	but if a man sins against the LORD,
c27459	who can intercede for him?”
c27460	But they would not listen to their father,
c27461	since the LORD intended
c27462	to put them to death.
c27463	And the boy Samuel continued to grow
c27464	in stature
c27465	and in favor with the LORD and with men.
c27466	Then a man of God came to Eli
c27467	and told him,
c27468	“This is what the LORD says:
c27469	‘Did I not clearly reveal Myself to your father's house
c27470	when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh's house?
c27471	And out of all the tribes of Israel I selected [your father] to be My priest,
c27472	to offer sacrifices on My altar,
c27473	to burn incense,
c27474	and to wear an ephod in My presence.
c27475	I also gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the Israelites {made by fire}.
c27476	Why, then, do you kick at My sacrifice and offering
c27477	that I have prescribed for [My] dwelling place?
c27478	You have honored your sons more than Me
c27479	by fattening yourselves with the best of all the offerings of My people Israel.’
c27480	Therefore, the LORD, the God of Israel, declares:
c27481	‘I did indeed say
c27482	that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever.
c27483	But now the LORD declares:
c27484	Far be it from Me!
c27485	For I will honor those who honor Me,
c27486	but those who despise Me will be disdained.
c27487	Behold, the days are coming
c27488	when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house,
c27489	so that no older man will be left in your house.
c27490	You will see distress [in My] dwelling place. Despite all
c27491	that is good in Israel,
c27492	no one in your house will ever again reach old age.
c27493	And every one of you that I do not cut off from My altar,
c27494	your eyes will fail
c27495	and your heart will grieve.
c27496	All your descendants will die in the prime of life.
c27497	And this sign ... to you
c27498	shall come ... concerning your two sons Hophni and Phinehas:
c27499	They will both die on the same day.
c27500	Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest.
c27501	whatever is in My heart and mind.
c27502	He will do
c27503	And I will build for him an enduring house,
c27504	and he will walk before My anointed one for all time.
c27505	And
c27506	everyone
c27507	left in your house
c27508	will come
c27509	and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a morsel of bread,
c27510	pleading,
c27511	“Please appoint me to some priestly office,
c27512	so that I may eat a piece of bread.”’”
c27513	And the boy Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli.
c27514	Now in those days the word of the LORD was rare
c27515	and visions were scarce.
c27516	And at that time
c27517	Eli, ... was lying in his room.
c27518	whose eyesight
c27519	had grown so dim
c27520	that he could not
c27521	see,
c27522	Before the lamp of God had gone out,
c27523	Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD,
c27524	where the ark of God was located.
c27525	Then the LORD called to Samuel,
c27526	and he answered,
c27527	“Here I am.”
c27528	He ran to Eli
c27529	and said,
c27530	“Here I am,
c27531	for you have called me.”
c27532	Eli replied.
c27533	“I did not call,”
c27534	“Go back
c27535	and lie down.”
c27536	So he went
c27537	and lay down.
c27538	Once again the LORD
c27539	called, “Samuel!”
c27540	So Samuel got up,
c27541	went to Eli,
c27542	and said,
c27543	“Here I am,
c27544	for you have called me.”
c27545	Eli replied.
c27546	I did not call,”
c27547	“My son,
c27548	“Go back
c27549	and lie down.”
c27550	Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD,
c27551	because the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.
c27552	Once again, ... the LORD
c27553	called to Samuel.
c27554	for the third time,
c27555	He got up,
c27556	went to Eli,
c27557	and said,
c27558	“Here I am,
c27559	for you have called me.”
c27560	Then Eli realized
c27561	that it was the LORD who was calling the boy.
c27562	he said to Samuel,
c27563	“Go
c27564	and lie down,”
c27565	“and
c27566	if He calls you,
c27567	say,
c27568	‘Speak,
c27569	LORD,
c27570	for Your servant is listening.’”
c27571	So Samuel went
c27572	and lay down in his place.
c27573	Then the LORD came
c27574	and stood there,
c27575	calling as before,
c27576	“Samuel! Samuel!”
c27577	And Samuel answered,
c27578	“Speak,
c27579	for Your servant is listening.”
c27580	Then the LORD said to Samuel,
c27581	“I am about to do something in Israel
c27582	at which ... of all
c27583	who hear it
c27584	the ears ... will tingle.
c27585	On that day I will carry out against Eli everything
c27586	I have spoken about his family,
c27587	from beginning
c27588	to end.
c27589	I told
c27590	him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity
c27591	of which he knows,
c27592	because his sons blasphemed God
c27593	and he did not restrain them.
c27594	Therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli,
c27595	‘The iniquity of Eli’s house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’”
c27596	Samuel lay down until the morning;
c27597	then he opened the doors of the LORD’s house.
c27598	He was afraid
c27599	to tell Eli the vision,
c27600	but Eli called to him
c27601	and said,
c27602	“Samuel, my son.”
c27603	answered Samuel.
c27604	“Here I am,”
c27605	Eli asked.
c27606	“What was the message
c27607	He gave you?”
c27608	“Do not hide it from me.
c27609	May God punish you,
c27610	and ever so severely,
c27611	if you hide from me anything
c27612	He said to you.”
c27613	So Samuel told him everything
c27614	and did not hide [a thing] from him.
c27615	replied Eli.
c27616	is the LORD,”
c27617	“He
c27618	what is good in His eyes.”
c27619	“Let Him do
c27620	And Samuel grew,
c27621	and the LORD was with him,
c27622	and {He let} none of [Samuel's] words fall to the ground.
c27623	So all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew
c27624	that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD.
c27625	And the LORD continued
c27626	to appear at Shiloh,
c27627	because there He revealed Himself to Samuel by His word.
c27628	Thus the word of Samuel came to all Israel.
c27629	Now the Israelites went out
c27630	to meet the Philistines in battle
c27631	and camped at Ebenezer,
c27632	while the Philistines camped at Aphek.
c27633	The Philistines arrayed themselves
c27634	against Israel,
c27635	and as the battle spread,
c27636	Israel was defeated by the Philistines,
c27637	who struck down about four thousand men on the battlefield.
c27638	When the troops returned to the camp,
c27639	the elders of Israel asked,
c27640	“Why has the LORD brought defeat on us before the Philistines today?
c27641	Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh,
c27642	so that it may go with us
c27643	to deliver us from the hand of our enemies.”
c27644	So the people sent [men] to Shiloh,
c27645	and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the LORD of Hosts,
c27646	who sits enthroned between the cherubim.
c27647	And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
c27648	When
c27649	the ark of the covenant of the LORD entered the camp,
c27650	all the Israelites raised such a great shout
c27651	that it shook the ground.
c27652	On hearing the noise of the shout, the Philistines
c27653	asked,
c27654	“What is this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?”
c27655	And when they realized
c27656	that the ark of the LORD had entered the camp,
c27657	the Philistines were afraid.
c27658	they said.
c27659	“The gods have entered their camp!”
c27661	“Woe to us,
c27662	for nothing like this has happened before.
c27663	Woe to us!
c27664	Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods?
c27665	These
c27666	are the gods
c27667	who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
c27668	Take courage
c27669	and be men,
c27670	O Philistines!
c27671	Otherwise, you will serve the Hebrews
c27672	just as they served you.
c27673	Now be men
c27674	and fight!”
c27675	So the Philistines fought,
c27676	and Israel was defeated,
c27677	fled
c27678	and each man ... to his tent.
c27679	The slaughter was very great—
c27680	thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell.
c27681	The ark of God was captured,
c27682	and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
c27683	a Benjamite ran from the battle line
c27684	That same day ... all the way to Shiloh,
c27685	with his clothes torn
c27686	and dirt on his head.
c27687	When he arrived,
c27688	there
c27689	was Eli sitting on his chair beside the road,
c27690	watching,
c27691	because his heart trembled for the ark of God.
c27692	When the man entered
c27693	the city to give a report,
c27694	the whole city cried out.
c27695	Eli heard the outcry
c27696	and asked,
c27697	“Why this commotion?”
c27698	So the man hurried over
c27700	and reported to Eli.
c27701	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old,
c27702	and his gaze was fixed
c27703	because he could not
c27704	see.
c27705	the man said to Eli.
c27706	“I
c27707	have just come from the battle,”
c27708	“I fled from there today.”
c27709	Eli asked.
c27710	“What happened,
c27711	my son?”
c27712	The messenger answered,
c27714	“Israel has fled before the Philistines,
c27715	and there has been a great slaughter among the people.
c27716	Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are both dead,
c27717	and the ark of God has been captured.”
c27718	As soon as
c27719	the ark of God was mentioned,
c27720	Eli fell backward from his chair by the city gate,
c27721	he broke his neck
c27722	and died.
c27723	and being old
c27724	and heavy,
c27725	Eli had judged Israel forty years.
c27726	Now Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant
c27727	and about to give birth.
c27728	When she heard the news
c27729	of the capture of God’s ark
c27730	and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband,
c27731	she collapsed
c27732	and gave birth,
c27733	for her labor pains came upon her.
c27734	As she was dying,
c27735	said,
c27736	the women attending to her
c27737	“Do not despair,
c27738	for you have given birth to a son!”
c27739	But she did not respond
c27740	or pay any heed.
c27741	And she named the boy Ichabod,
c27742	saying,
c27743	“The glory has departed from Israel,”
c27744	because the ark of God had been captured
c27745	[and] her father-in-law and her husband had been killed.
c27746	she said,
c27747	“The glory has departed from Israel,”
c27748	“for the ark of God has been captured.”
c27749	After the Philistines had captured the ark of God,
c27750	they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod,
c27752	carried it into the temple of Dagon,
c27753	and set it beside [his statue].
c27754	When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning,
c27755	there
c27756	was Dagon, fallen on his face before the ark of the LORD.
c27757	So they took Dagon
c27758	and returned him to his place.
c27759	But when they got up early the next morning,
c27760	there
c27761	was Dagon, fallen on his face before the ark of the LORD,
c27762	with his head [and] his hands broken off and lying on the threshold.
c27763	Only [the torso] remained.
c27764	That is why, ... the priests of Dagon and everyone ... do not step
c27765	who enters the temple of Dagon
c27766	to this day, ... in Ashdod ... on the threshold.
c27767	Now the hand of the LORD was heavy on the people of Ashdod
c27768	ravaging them
c27769	and its vicinity, ... and afflicting them with tumors.
c27770	And when the men of Ashdod saw
c27771	what was happening,
c27772	they said,
c27773	“The ark of the God of Israel must not stay here with us,
c27774	because His hand is heavy upon us and upon our god Dagon.”
c27776	So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines
c27777	and asked,
c27778	“What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?”
c27779	they replied.
c27780	“[It] must be moved to Gath,”
c27781	So they carried away the ark of the God of Israel.
c27782	was also
c27783	But after they had moved [the ark to Gath],
c27784	the LORD’s hand ... against that city,
c27785	throwing it into great confusion
c27786	and afflicting the men of the city, both young and old,
c27787	with an outbreak of tumors.
c27788	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron,
c27790	but as it arrived,
c27791	the Ekronites cried out,
c27793	“They have brought us the ark of the God of Israel
c27794	in order to kill us
c27795	and our people!”
c27796	“Send away
c27797	Then [the Ekronites] assembled all the rulers of the Philistines
c27798	and said,
c27799	the ark of the God of Israel.
c27800	It must return to its place,
c27801	so that it will not kill us and our people!”
c27802	For a deadly confusion had pervaded the city;
c27803	the hand of God was heavy upon it.
c27804	Those
c27805	who did not die
c27806	were afflicted with tumors,
c27807	and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.
c27808	When the ark of the LORD had been in the land of the Philistines for seven months,
c27809	the Philistines summoned the priests and diviners,
c27810	saying,
c27811	“What shall we do with the ark of the LORD?
c27812	Tell
c27813	us how to send it back to its place.”
c27814	They replied,
c27815	“If you return the ark of the God of Israel,
c27816	do not send it away empty,
c27817	but by all means return [it] to Him with a guilt offering.
c27818	Then you will be healed,
c27819	and you will understand ... you.”
c27820	why His hand has not been lifted from
c27821	asked the Philistines.
c27822	“What guilt offering
c27823	should we send back to Him?”
c27824	they said,
c27825	“Five gold tumors and five gold rats,” ... “[according to] the number of rulers of the Philistines,
c27826	since the same plague [has struck] both you and your rulers.
c27827	Make images of your tumors and of the rats
c27828	that are ravaging the land.
c27829	Give glory to the God of Israel,
c27830	and perhaps He will lift His hand from you and your gods and your land.
c27831	Why harden your hearts
c27832	as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs?
c27833	did they not
c27834	When He afflicted them,
c27835	send the people on their way
c27836	as they departed?
c27837	Now, therefore,
c27839	prepare one new cart
c27840	with two milk cows
c27841	that have never been yoked.
c27842	Hitch the cows to the cart,
c27843	but take their calves away and pen them up.
c27844	Take the ark of the LORD,
c27845	set it on the cart,
c27846	and ... the gold objects
c27847	you are sending Him as a guilt offering.
c27848	in a chest beside it put
c27849	Then send [the ark]
c27850	on its way,
c27851	but keep watching it.
c27852	If it goes up the road to its homeland, toward Beth-shemesh,
c27853	it is the LORD who has brought on us this great disaster.
c27854	But if it does not,
c27855	then we will know
c27856	that it was not His hand that punished us
c27857	by chance.”
c27858	and that it happened
c27859	So the men did [as instructed].
c27860	They took two milk cows,
c27861	hitched them to the cart,
c27862	and penned up their calves.
c27863	Then they put the ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the box containing the gold rats and the images of the tumors.
c27864	And the cows headed straight up the road toward Beth-shemesh,
c27865	staying on that one highway and lowing as they went,
c27866	never straying to the right or to the left.
c27867	The rulers of the Philistines followed behind them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
c27868	Now [the people of] Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley,
c27869	and when they looked up
c27870	and saw the ark,
c27871	they were overjoyed
c27872	at the sight.
c27873	The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh
c27874	and stopped there
c27875	near a large rock.
c27876	The people chopped up the cart
c27877	and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
c27878	And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD ... the box
c27879	and ... containing
c27880	the gold objects,
c27881	and they placed them on the large rock.
c27882	the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings
c27883	That day ... and made sacrifices to the LORD.
c27884	And when the five rulers of the Philistines had seen [this],
c27885	they returned to Ekron that same day.
c27886	gold tumor [for each city]:
c27887	As a guilt offering to the LORD, the Philistines had sent back
c27888	one ... Ashdod,
c27889	Gaza,
c27890	Ashkelon,
c27891	Gath,
c27892	and Ekron.
c27893	The number of gold rats also corresponded to the number of Philistine cities [belonging] to the five rulers— the fortified cities and their outlying villages. And ... the large rock
c27894	to this day ... on which they placed the ark of the LORD
c27895	is in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.
c27896	But God struck down some of the people of Beth-shemesh
c27897	because they looked inside the ark of the LORD.
c27898	He struck down seventy men,
c27899	and the people mourned ... them
c27900	because the LORD had struck ... with a great slaughter.
c27901	The men of Beth-shemesh asked,
c27902	“Who can
c27903	stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God?
c27904	To whom should the ark go up from here?”
c27905	So they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath-jearim,
c27906	saying,
c27907	“The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD.
c27908	Come down
c27909	[and] take it up with you.”
c27910	Then the men of Kiriath-jearim came
c27911	for the ark of the LORD and took
c27912	it into Abinadab's house on the hill.
c27913	And they consecrated his son Eleazar
c27914	to guard the ark of the LORD.
c27915	And from that day ... passed,
c27916	as the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim.
c27917	a long time
c27918	twenty years in all,
c27919	And all the house of Israel mourned and sought after the LORD.
c27920	Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel,
c27922	“If you are returning to the LORD with all your hearts,
c27923	then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and Ashtoreths among you,
c27924	prepare your hearts for the LORD,
c27925	and serve Him only.
c27926	And He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”
c27927	So the Israelites put away the Baals and Ashtoreths
c27928	and served only the LORD.
c27929	Then Samuel said,
c27930	“Gather all Israel to Mizpah,
c27931	and I will pray to the LORD on your behalf.”
c27932	When they had gathered at Mizpah,
c27933	they drew water
c27934	and poured it out before the LORD.
c27935	On that day they fasted,
c27936	and there they confessed,
c27937	“We have sinned against the LORD.”
c27938	And Samuel judged the Israelites at Mizpah.
c27939	When the Philistines heard
c27940	that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah,
c27941	their rulers marched up toward Israel.
c27942	And when the Israelites learned of this,
c27943	they feared the Philistines
c27944	[and] said to Samuel,
c27945	“Do not stop
c27946	crying out to the LORD our God for us,
c27947	so that He will deliver us from the hand of the Philistines.”
c27948	Then Samuel took a suckling lamb
c27949	and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD.
c27950	He cried out to the LORD on behalf of Israel,
c27951	and the LORD answered him.
c27952	was
c27953	Samuel ... sacrificing the burnt offering.
c27954	As the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel,
c27955	But that day the LORD thundered loudly against the Philistines
c27956	and threw them into such confusion
c27957	that they fled before Israel.
c27958	Then the men of Israel charged out of Mizpah
c27959	and pursued the Philistines,
c27960	striking them down all the way to an area below Beth-car.
c27961	Afterward, Samuel took a stone
c27962	and set [it] up between Mizpah and Shen.
c27963	He named it Ebenezer,
c27964	saying,
c27965	“Thus far the LORD has helped us.”
c27966	So the Philistines were subdued
c27967	and did not ... again.
c27968	invade the territory of Israel
c27969	And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
c27970	The cities ... were restored
c27971	which the Philistines had taken,
c27972	from Ekron to Gath, ... to Israel,
c27973	[who] also delivered the surrounding territory from the hand of the Philistines.
c27974	And there was peace between the Israelites and the Amorites.
c27975	So Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
c27976	Every year he would go ... from
c27977	on a circuit ... Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah,
c27978	judging Israel in all these places.
c27979	Then he would return to Ramah
c27980	because his home was there,
c27981	and there he judged Israel
c27982	and built an altar to the LORD.
c27984	When Samuel grew old,
c27985	he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.
c27986	The name of his firstborn son was Joel,
c27987	and the name of his second was Abijah.
c27988	They were judges in Beersheba.
c27989	But his sons did not walk in his ways;
c27990	they turned aside toward dishonest gain,
c27991	accepted bribes,
c27992	and perverted justice.
c27993	So all the elders of Israel gathered together
c27994	and came to Samuel at Ramah.
c27995	they said,
c27996	“Look,” ... “you are old,
c27997	and your sons do not walk in your ways.
c27998	Now appoint a king
c27999	to judge us like all the other nations.”
c28000	their demand was displeasing in the sight of Samuel;
c28001	But when they said,
c28002	“Give us a king
c28003	to judge us,”
c28004	so he prayed to the LORD.
c28005	And the LORD said to Samuel,
c28006	“Listen to the voice of the people in all
c28007	that they say to you,
c28008	for it is not you they have rejected,
c28009	but they have rejected Me
c28010	as their king.
c28012	they have done from the day
c28013	I brought them up out of Egypt
c28014	until this day,
c28015	forsaking Me
c28016	and serving other gods.
c28017	They are doing to you just as
c28018	Now
c28019	listen to them,
c28020	but you must solemnly warn them
c28021	and show them the manner of the king
c28022	who will reign over them.”
c28023	So Samuel spoke all the words of the LORD to the people
c28024	who were asking him for a king.
c28025	He said,
c28026	“This will be the manner of the king
c28027	who will rule over you:
c28028	He will take your sons
c28029	and appoint [them] to his own chariots and horses,
c28030	to run in front of his chariots.
c28031	He will appoint some for himself as commanders of thousands and of fifties,
c28032	and others to plow his ground,
c28033	to reap his harvest,
c28034	and to make his weapons of war and equip his chariots.
c28035	And he will take your daughters [to [be] perfumers, cooks, and bakers.
c28036	He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves
c28037	and give them to his servants.
c28038	He will take a tenth of your grain and vintage
c28039	and give it to his officials and servants.
c28040	And he will take your menservants and maidservants and your best cattle and donkeys
c28041	and put [them] to his own use.
c28042	He will take a tenth of your flocks,
c28043	and you yourselves will become his slaves.
c28044	When that day comes, you will beg for relief from the king
c28045	you have chosen,
c28046	but the LORD will not answer you on that day.”
c28047	Nevertheless , the people refused
c28048	to listen to Samuel.
c28049	they said.
c28050	“No!”
c28051	“We must have a king over us.
c28052	Then we will be like all the other nations,
c28053	with a king to judge us,
c28054	to go out before us,
c28055	and to fight our battles.”
c28056	Samuel listened to all the words of the people
c28057	and repeated them in the hearing of the LORD.
c28058	the LORD said to Samuel.
c28059	“Listen to their voice,”
c28060	“Appoint a king for them.”
c28061	Then Samuel told the men of Israel,
c28062	must go back
c28063	“Everyone ... to his city.”
c28064	Now there was a Benjamite,
c28065	whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah
c28066	of Benjamin.
c28067	a powerful man,
c28068	And he had a son
c28069	named Saul,
c28070	choice and handsome,
c28071	without equal among the Israelites—
c28072	a head taller than any of the people.
c28073	One day the donkeys of Saul’s father Kish wandered off.
c28074	So Kish said to his son Saul,
c28075	“Take one of the servants
c28077	and go
c28078	look for the donkeys.”
c28079	So [Saul] passed through the hill country of Ephraim
c28080	and then through the land of Shalishah, ... [He and the servant] went
c28081	but did not find [the donkeys].
c28082	through the region of Shaalim, ... Then they went
c28083	but [they were] not [there].
c28084	through the land of Benjamin,
c28085	and still they did not find them.
c28086	When they reached the land of Zuph,
c28087	Saul said to his servant,
c28089	“Come,
c28090	let us go back,
c28091	or my father will stop [worrying] about the donkeys
c28092	and start worrying about us.”
c28093	said the servant,
c28094	“Look,” ... “in this city there is a man of God
c28095	who is highly respected;
c28096	everything
c28097	he says ... us which
c28098	surely comes to pass.
c28099	Let us go there now.
c28100	Maybe he will tell ... way
c28101	to go.”
c28102	Saul replied,
c28103	“If we do go,”
c28104	“what can we give the man?
c28105	For the bread in our packs is gone,
c28106	and there is no gift
c28107	to take to the man of God.
c28108	What do we have?”
c28109	Again the servant
c28110	answered,
c28112	“Look, I have here in my hand a quarter shekel of silver.
c28113	I will give it to the man of God,
c28114	and he will tell us our way.”
c28115	(Formerly in Israel, a man ... would say,
c28116	on his way
c28117	to inquire of God
c28118	“Come,
c28119	let us go to the seer,”
c28120	for the prophet of today was formerly called the seer.)
c28121	said Saul to his servant.
c28122	“Good,”
c28123	“Come,
c28124	let us go.”
c28125	So they set out for the city
c28126	where the man of God was.
c28127	And as they were climbing the hill to the city,
c28128	they met some young women
c28129	coming out
c28130	to draw water
c28131	and asked,
c28132	“Is the seer here?”
c28133	they answered.
c28135	he is
c28136	“Yes, ... ahead of you,”
c28137	“Hurry now,
c28138	for today he has come to the city
c28139	because the people have a sacrifice on the high place.
c28140	As soon as you enter the city
c28141	you can find him ... that,
c28142	before he goes up to the high place
c28143	to eat.
c28144	The people will not eat ... because
c28145	until he comes,
c28146	he must bless the sacrifice;
c28147	after ... the guests will eat.
c28149	Go up
c28151	at once; you will find him.”
c28152	So Saul and his servant went up toward the city,
c28153	and as they were entering it,
c28154	there was
c28155	Samuel coming
c28156	toward them
c28157	on his way up to the high place.
c28158	Now on the day ... the LORD had revealed to Samuel,
c28159	before Saul’s arrival,
c28161	“At this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, ... to Me.”
c28162	and you are to anoint him leader over My people Israel;
c28163	he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines.
c28164	For I have looked upon My people,
c28165	because their cry has come
c28166	When Samuel saw Saul,
c28167	the LORD told him,
c28168	“Here is the man
c28169	of whom I spoke;
c28170	he shall rule over My people.”
c28171	Saul approached Samuel in the gateway
c28172	and asked,
c28173	“Would you please tell me
c28174	where the seer's house [is]?”
c28175	Samuel replied.
c28177	“I am the seer,”
c28178	“Go up before me to the high place,
c28179	for you shall eat with me today.
c28180	And when I send you off in the morning,
c28181	all
c28182	that is in your heart.
c28183	I will tell you
c28184	As for the donkeys
c28185	you lost three days ago,
c28186	do not worry about them,
c28187	for they have been found.
c28188	And upon whom [is] all the desire of Israel,
c28189	if not upon you and on all your father's house?”
c28190	Saul replied,
c28192	“Am I not a Benjamite from the smallest tribe of Israel,
c28193	and is not my clan the least of all the clans of Benjamin?
c28194	So why would you say such a thing to me?”
c28195	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant,
c28196	brought them into the hall,
c28197	and seated them in the place of honor among those who were invited—
c28198	about thirty in all.
c28199	And Samuel said to the cook,
c28200	“Bring the portion
c28201	I gave you
c28202	and told
c28203	you to set aside.”
c28204	So the cook picked up the leg
c28205	and what was attached to it
c28206	and set [it] before Saul.
c28207	Then Samuel said,
c28208	“Here is
c28209	what was kept back.
c28210	[It] was set apart for you.
c28211	Eat,
c28212	for it has been kept for you for this occasion,
c28213	from the time I said,
c28214	‘I have invited the people.’
c28215	So Saul dined with Samuel that day.
c28216	And after they had come down from the high place into the city,
c28217	Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof of his house.
c28218	They got up early in the morning,
c28220	and just before dawn
c28221	Samuel called to Saul on the roof,
c28223	“Get ready,
c28224	and I will send you on your way!”
c28225	So Saul arose,
c28226	and both he and Samuel went outside together.
c28227	As they were going down to the edge of the city,
c28228	Samuel said to Saul,
c28229	“Tell the servant
c28230	to go on ahead of us,
c28231	So the servant went on.
c28232	but you stay for a while,
c28233	and I will reveal to you the word of God.”
c28234	Then Samuel took a flask of oil,
c28235	poured it out on Saul’s head,
c28236	kissed him,
c28237	and said,
c28238	“Has not
c28239	the LORD anointed you ruler over His inheritance?
c28240	When you leave me today,
c28241	you will find two men at Rachel’s tomb in Zelzah on the border of Benjamin.
c28242	They will say to you,
c28243	‘The donkeys ... have been found,
c28244	you seek
c28246	and now your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys
c28247	and is worrying about you,
c28248	asking,
c28249	“What should I do about my son?”’
c28250	Then you will go on from there
c28251	until you come to the oak of Tabor.
c28252	Three men ... will meet you there,
c28253	going up to God at Bethel
c28254	one carrying three young goats,
c28255	another carrying three loaves of bread,
c28256	and another carrying a skin of wine.
c28257	They will greet you
c28258	and give you two [loaves] of bread,
c28259	which you will accept from their hands.
c28260	After that you will come to Gibeah of God,
c28261	where the Philistines [have] an outpost.
c28263	As you approach the city,
c28264	you will meet a group of prophets
c28265	coming down from the high place,
c28266	preceded by harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres,
c28267	and they will be prophesying.
c28268	Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you,
c28269	and you will prophesy with them;
c28270	and you will be transformed into a different person.
c28272	When these signs have come,
c28273	do
c28274	as the occasion demands,
c28275	for God [is] with you.
c28276	And you shall go before me to Gilgal,
c28277	and surely
c28278	I will come to you
c28279	to offer burnt offerings
c28280	and to sacrifice peace offerings.
c28281	Wait seven days
c28282	until I come to you
c28283	and show you
c28284	what you are to do.”
c28286	As Saul turned
c28287	to leave Samuel,
c28288	God changed Saul's heart,
c28289	and all the signs came to pass that day.
c28290	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah,
c28291	a group of prophets
c28292	met him.
c28293	Then the Spirit of God rushed upon him,
c28294	and he prophesied along with them.
c28295	All those who had formerly known [Saul] ... has happened
c28296	and saw
c28298	him prophesying with the prophets
c28299	asked
c28300	one another,
c28301	“What ... to the son of Kish?
c28302	Is Saul also among the prophets?”
c28303	Then a man who lived there replied,
c28305	“And who is their father?”
c28306	So the saying became a proverb:
c28307	“Is Saul also among the prophets?”
c28308	And when Saul had finished
c28309	prophesying,
c28310	he went to the high place.
c28311	Now Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, ... to
c28312	“Where did you go?”
c28313	Saul replied.
c28314	“To look for the donkeys,”
c28315	“When we saw
c28316	they were not to be found,
c28317	we went ... Samuel.”
c28318	Saul’s uncle asked,
c28319	“Tell me,”
c28320	“what did Samuel say to you?”
c28321	And Saul replied,
c28322	“He assured us ... tell [his uncle]
c28323	that the donkeys had been found.”
c28324	But Saul did not ... about the kingship.
c28325	what Samuel had said
c28326	After this, Samuel summoned the people to the LORD at Mizpah
c28327	and said to the Israelites,
c28328	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c28329	‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt,
c28330	and I rescued you from the hands of the Egyptians and of all the kingdoms
c28331	that oppressed you.’
c28332	But today you have rejected your God,
c28333	who delivers you from all your troubles and afflictions,
c28334	and you have said to Him,
c28335	‘No, set a king over us.’
c28336	Now therefore
c28337	present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans.”
c28338	Thus Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward,
c28339	and the tribe of Benjamin was selected.
c28340	Then he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by its clans,
c28341	and the clan of Matri was selected.
c28342	Finally, Saul son of Kish was selected.
c28343	But when they looked for him,
c28344	they could not find him.
c28345	So again they inquired of the LORD,
c28346	“Has the man come here yet?”
c28347	And the LORD replied,
c28348	“Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.”
c28349	So they ran
c28350	and brought [Saul],
c28351	and when he stood among the people,
c28352	he was a head taller than any of the others.
c28353	Samuel said to all the people,
c28354	“Do you see
c28355	the one the LORD has chosen?
c28356	[There is] no one like him among all the people.”
c28357	And all the people shouted,
c28359	“Long live the king!”
c28360	Then Samuel explained to the people the rights of kingship.
c28361	He wrote them on a scroll
c28362	and laid [it] up before the LORD.
c28363	And Samuel sent all the people away, each to his home.
c28364	Saul also went to his home in Gibeah,
c28365	and the [men] of valor ... went with him.
c28366	whose hearts God had touched
c28367	But some worthless men said,
c28368	“How can this [man] deliver us?”
c28369	So they despised him
c28370	and brought him no gifts;
c28371	but [Saul] held his peace.
c28372	Soon Nahash the Ammonite came up
c28373	and laid siege to Jabesh-gilead.
c28374	All the men of Jabesh said to him,
c28375	“Make a treaty with us,
c28376	and we will serve you.”
c28377	But Nahash the Ammonite replied,
c28378	“I will make [a treaty] with you on one [condition],
c28379	that I may put out everyone’s right eye
c28380	and bring reproach upon all Israel.”
c28381	replied the elders of Jabesh,
c28382	“Hold off for seven days,”
c28383	“and let us send messengers throughout Israel.
c28384	If [there is] no one
c28385	to deliver us,
c28386	we will surrender to you.”
c28387	When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul
c28388	and reported these terms in the hearing of the people,
c28389	they all ... aloud.
c28390	wept
c28391	Just then
c28392	Saul was returning from the field, behind his oxen.
c28393	asked Saul.
c28394	“What [troubles] the people?”
c28395	“Why are they weeping?”
c28396	And they relayed to him the words of the men from Jabesh.
c28397	the Spirit of God rushed upon him,
c28398	When Saul heard their words,
c28399	and he burned with great anger.
c28400	He took a pair of oxen,
c28401	cut them into pieces,
c28402	and sent [them] by messengers throughout the land of Israel,
c28403	proclaiming,
c28404	of anyone who does not march behind Saul and Samuel.”
c28405	“This is what will be done to the oxen
c28406	Then the terror of the LORD fell upon the people,
c28407	and they turned out as one man.
c28408	And when [Saul] numbered them at Bezek,
c28409	there were 300,000 Israelites
c28410	and 30,000 men of Judah.
c28411	So they said to the messengers
c28412	who had come,
c28413	“Tell the men of Jabesh-gilead:
c28414	‘Deliverance will be yours tomorrow
c28415	by the time the sun is hot.’”
c28416	And when the messengers
c28417	relayed [this] to the men of Jabesh,
c28418	they rejoiced.
c28419	Then the men of Jabesh said [to Nahash],
c28420	“Tomorrow we will come out,
c28421	and you can do with us whatever
c28422	seems good to you.”
c28423	The next day
c28424	Saul organized the troops into three divisions,
c28425	and during the morning watch they invaded the camp
c28426	of the Ammonites and slaughtered
c28427	them until the hottest part of the day.
c28428	And
c28429	the survivors
c28430	were so scattered
c28431	that no two of them were left together.
c28432	Then the people said to Samuel,
c28433	“Who
c28434	said
c28435	that Saul should not reign over us?
c28436	Bring those men here,
c28437	so that we can kill them!”
c28438	But Saul ordered,
c28439	“No one shall be put to death this day,
c28440	for today the LORD has worked salvation in Israel.”
c28441	Then Samuel said to the people,
c28442	“Come,
c28443	let us go to Gilgal
c28444	and renew the kingship there.”
c28445	So all the people went to Gilgal
c28446	[and] confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the LORD.
c28447	There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD,
c28448	and Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced greatly.
c28449	Then Samuel said to all Israel,
c28450	“I have listened to your voice in all
c28451	that you have said to me,
c28452	and I have set over you a king.
c28453	Now
c28454	here is the king walking before you,
c28455	and I am old
c28456	and gray,
c28457	and my sons
c28458	are here with you.
c28459	I have walked before you from my youth until this day.
c28460	Here I am.
c28461	Bear witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed:
c28462	Whose ox ... have I taken?
c28463	or donkey ... Whom ... have I accepted
c28464	have I wronged ... From whose
c28465	or oppressed?
c28466	hand ... a bribe
c28467	and closed my eyes? Tell me,
c28468	and I will restore [it] to you.
c28469	they replied,
c28470	“You have not wronged us
c28471	or oppressed us,”
c28472	“nor have you taken anything from the hand of man.”
c28473	Samuel said to them,
c28474	“The LORD is a witness against you,
c28475	and His anointed is a witness today,
c28476	that you have not found anything in my hand.”
c28477	they said.
c28478	“He is a witness,”
c28479	Then Samuel said to the people,
c28480	“The LORD
c28481	is the One who appointed Moses and Aaron,
c28482	and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt.
c28483	Now
c28484	present yourselves,
c28485	so I may confront you before the LORD with all the righteous acts He
c28486	has done for you and your fathers.
c28487	When Jacob went to Egypt,
c28488	your fathers cried out to the LORD,
c28489	and He sent them Moses and Aaron,
c28490	who brought your fathers out of Egypt
c28491	and settled them in this place.
c28492	But they forgot the LORD their God,
c28493	and He sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab,
c28494	who fought against them.
c28495	Then they cried out to the LORD
c28496	and said,
c28497	‘We have sinned,
c28498	for we have forsaken the LORD
c28499	and served the Baals and Ashtoreths.
c28500	Now
c28501	deliver us from the hands of our enemies,
c28502	and we will serve You.’
c28503	So the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel,
c28504	and delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side,
c28505	and you lived securely.
c28506	But when you saw
c28507	that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you,
c28508	you said to me,
c28509	‘No,
c28510	we must have a king to rule over us’—
c28511	even though the LORD your God is your king.
c28512	Now
c28513	here is the king
c28514	you have chosen, the one
c28515	you requested.
c28516	Behold,
c28517	the king [whom] the LORD has placed over you.
c28518	If you fear the LORD
c28519	and serve Him
c28520	and obey His voice,
c28521	and if you do not rebel against the command of the LORD,
c28522	and if both you and the king ... follow
c28523	who rules over you
c28524	the LORD your God, [then all will be well].
c28525	But if you disobey the LORD
c28526	and rebel against His command,
c28527	then the hand of the LORD will be against you as [it was] against your fathers.
c28528	Now, therefore,
c28529	stand
c28530	and see this great thing
c28531	that the LORD will do before your eyes.
c28532	Is it not the wheat harvest today?
c28533	I will call on the LORD
c28534	to send thunder and rain,
c28535	so that you will know
c28536	and see
c28537	what a great evil
c28538	you have committed in the sight of the LORD
c28539	by asking for a king.”
c28540	So Samuel called to the LORD,
c28541	and on that day the LORD sent thunder and rain.
c28542	As a result, all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
c28543	They pleaded with Samuel,
c28544	“Pray to the LORD your God for your servants,
c28545	so we will not die!
c28546	For we have added to all our sins the evil
c28547	of asking for a king.”
c28548	Samuel replied.
c28549	“Do not be afraid,”
c28550	“Even though you have committed all this evil,
c28551	do not turn aside from following the LORD,
c28552	but serve the LORD with all your heart.
c28553	Do not turn aside
c28554	after worthless
c28555	things that cannot profit [you]
c28556	or deliver [you],
c28557	for they [are] empty.
c28558	Indeed, for the sake of His great name the LORD will not abandon His people,
c28559	because [He] was pleased
c28560	to make you His [own].
c28561	As for me,
c28562	far be it from me that I
c28563	should sin against the LORD
c28564	by ceasing
c28565	to pray for you.
c28566	And I will continue to teach you the good and right way.
c28567	Above all, fear the LORD
c28568	and serve Him faithfully with all your heart;
c28569	consider
c28570	what great things He has done for you.
c28571	But if you persist in doing evil,
c28572	both you and your king will be swept away.”
c28573	Saul was [thirty] years old
c28574	when he became king,
c28575	and he reigned over Israel [forty]-two years.
c28576	He chose for himself three thousand [men] of Israel: ... Saul
c28577	Two thousand were with ... at Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel,
c28578	and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin.
c28579	And the rest of the troops he sent away, each to his own [home].
c28580	Then Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost
c28581	at Geba,
c28582	and the Philistines heard [about it].
c28583	So Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land,
c28584	saying,
c28585	“Let the Hebrews hear!”
c28586	And all Israel heard
c28587	the news:
c28588	“Saul has attacked an outpost of the Philistines,
c28589	and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines!”
c28590	Then the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
c28591	Now the Philistines assembled
c28592	to fight against Israel
c28593	with three thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops ... as the sand
c28594	on the seashore.
c28595	as numerous
c28596	They went up
c28597	and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven.
c28598	Seeing ... the men of Israel
c28599	that they were in danger
c28600	because their troops were hard-pressed,
c28601	hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in cellars and cisterns.
c28602	Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead.
c28603	Saul, however,
c28604	remained at Gilgal,
c28605	and all his troops were quaking with fear.
c28606	And [Saul] waited seven days for the time appointed
c28607	by Samuel,
c28608	but Samuel did not come to Gilgal,
c28609	and the troops began to desert [Saul].
c28610	So [he] said,
c28611	“Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.”
c28612	And he offered up the burnt offering.
c28614	Just as he finished
c28615	offering the burnt offering,
c28617	Samuel arrived,
c28618	and Saul went out
c28620	to greet him.
c28621	Samuel asked.
c28622	“What have you done?”
c28623	And Saul replied,
c28624	“When I saw
c28625	that the troops were deserting me,
c28626	and that you did not come at the appointed time
c28627	and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash,
c28628	I thought,
c28629	‘Now the Philistines will descend upon me at Gilgal,
c28630	and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.’
c28631	So I felt compelled
c28632	to offer the burnt offering.”
c28633	Samuel declared.
c28634	“You have acted foolishly,”
c28635	“You have not kept the command the LORD your God
c28636	gave you;
c28637	if you had, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.
c28638	But now your kingdom will not endure;
c28639	the LORD has sought a man after His own heart
c28640	and appointed him ruler over His people,
c28641	because you have not kept
c28642	the command of the LORD.”
c28643	Then Samuel set out
c28644	from Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin.
c28645	And Saul numbered the troops
c28646	who were with him,
c28647	about six hundred men.
c28648	Now Saul and Jonathan his son and the troops
c28649	with them
c28650	were staying in Geba of Benjamin,
c28651	while the Philistines camped at Michmash.
c28652	And raiders went out of the Philistine camp in three divisions.
c28653	One headed toward Ophrah in the land of Shual,
c28654	another toward Beth-horon,
c28655	and the [third] down the border road
c28656	overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness.
c28657	And no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel,
c28658	because the Philistines had said,
c28659	“The Hebrews must not be allowed to make swords or spears.”
c28660	Instead, all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines
c28661	to sharpen
c28662	their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles.
c28663	The charge was a pim for the plowshares and mattocks, and a third [of a pim] for the pitchforks and axes
c28664	and for repointing an oxgoad.
c28665	So on the day of battle
c28666	not a sword or spear could be found in the hands of the troops
c28667	with Saul and Jonathan;
c28668	only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons.
c28669	And a garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Michmash.
c28670	vvv One day
c28671	Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor,
c28672	“Come,
c28673	let us cross over to the Philistine outpost
c28674	on the other side.”
c28675	But [Jonathan] did not tell his father.
c28676	Meanwhile, Saul was staying under the pomegranate tree ... on the outskirts of Gibeah.
c28677	in Migron
c28678	And the troops
c28679	who [were] with him
c28680	numbered about six hundred men,
c28681	including Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was the son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of the LORD in Shiloh.
c28682	But the troops did not know
c28683	that Jonathan had left.
c28684	of the pass
c28685	that Jonathan intended
c28686	to cross to reach the Philistine outpost.
c28687	Now there were cliffs on both sides
c28689	One was named Bozez
c28690	and the other Seneh.
c28691	One cliff stood to the north toward Michmash,
c28692	and the other to the south toward Geba.
c28693	Jonathan said to the young man bearing his armor,
c28694	“Come,
c28695	let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men.
c28696	Perhaps the LORD will work
c28697	on our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD
c28698	from saving, whether by many or by few.”
c28699	His armor-bearer replied,
c28700	“Do all
c28701	that is in your heart.
c28702	Go ahead;
c28703	I am with you heart and soul.”
c28704	said Jonathan,
c28705	“Very well,” ... “we will cross over toward [these] men
c28706	and show ourselves to them.
c28707	If they say, ... to them.
c28708	‘Wait
c28709	until we come to you,’
c28710	then we will stay where
c28711	we are and not go up
c28712	But if they say,
c28713	‘Come on up,’
c28714	then we will go up,
c28715	because ... that the LORD has delivered them into our hands.”
c28716	this will be our sign
c28717	So the two of them showed themselves to the outpost of the Philistines,
c28718	[who] exclaimed,
c28719	“Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes
c28720	in which they were hiding!”
c28721	So the men of the outpost called out to Jonathan and his armor-bearer,
c28723	“Come on up,
c28724	and we will teach you a lesson!”
c28725	Jonathan told his armor-bearer,
c28726	“Follow me,”
c28727	“for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.”
c28728	Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet,
c28729	with his armor-bearer behind him.
c28730	And [the Philistines] fell before Jonathan,
c28731	and his armor-bearer followed and finished them off.
c28732	In that first assault,
c28733	Jonathan and his armor-bearer struck down
c28734	about twenty men over half an acre of land.
c28735	Terror struck [the Philistines] in the camp, in the field, and among all the people.
c28736	Even those in the outposts and raiding parties trembled. Indeed,
c28737	the earth quaked
c28738	and panic spread from God.
c28739	Now when Saul's watchmen at Gibeah in Benjamin looked
c28740	and saw
c28741	the troops melting away
c28742	and scattering
c28743	in every direction,
c28744	Saul said to the troops
c28745	with him,
c28746	“Call the roll
c28747	and see
c28748	who has left us.”
c28749	And when they had called the roll,
c28750	they saw
c28751	that Jonathan and his armor-bearer [were] not [there].
c28752	Then Saul said to Ahijah,
c28753	“Bring the ark of God.”
c28754	(For at that time it was
c28755	with the Israelites.)
c28757	While Saul was talking to the priest,
c28758	the commotion
c28759	in the Philistine camp
c28760	continued to increase.
c28761	So Saul said to the priest,
c28762	“Withdraw your hand.”
c28763	Then Saul and all his troops assembled
c28765	and marched to the battle,
c28766	and they found [the Philistines]
c28767	with each man wielding the sword against his neighbor.
c28768	in very great confusion,
c28769	And the Hebrews ... previously ... of the Philistines
c28770	who had ... gone up into the surrounding camps ... were with
c28772	now went over to the Israelites
c28773	who ... Saul and Jonathan.
c28774	When all the Israelites
c28775	who had been hiding in the hill country of Ephraim
c28776	heard
c28777	that the Philistines were fleeing,
c28778	they also joined Saul and Jonathan in the battle.
c28779	So the LORD saved Israel that day,
c28780	and the battle moved on beyond Beth-aven.
c28781	Now the men of Israel were in distress that day,
c28782	for Saul had placed the troops under an oath,
c28783	saying,
c28784	“Cursed [is] the man
c28785	who eats [any] food before evening,
c28786	before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.”
c28787	So none of the troops tasted any food.
c28788	Then all [the troops] entered the forest,
c28789	and there was honey on the ground.
c28790	And when [they] entered the forest
c28791	and saw the flowing honey,
c28792	not one of them put his hand to his mouth,
c28793	because [they] feared the oath.
c28794	Jonathan, however, had not heard that
c28795	his father {had charged} the people with the oath.
c28796	So he reached out the end of the staff
c28797	in his hand,
c28798	dipped it into the honeycomb,
c28799	and put his hand to his mouth;
c28800	and his eyes brightened.
c28801	Then one of the soldiers
c28802	told him,
c28803	“Your father bound the troops with a solemn oath, saying,
c28805	‘Cursed [is] the man
c28806	who eats food today.’
c28807	That is why the people are faint.”
c28808	Jonathan replied.
c28809	“My father has brought trouble to the land,”
c28810	“Just look
c28811	at how my eyes have brightened
c28812	because I tasted a little of this honey.
c28813	How much better it would have been
c28814	if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder ... from their enemies!
c28815	they took
c28816	Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been much greater?”
c28817	That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon,
c28818	the people were very faint.
c28819	So they rushed greedily to the plunder,
c28820	taking sheep, cattle, and calves.
c28821	They slaughtered them on the ground
c28822	and ate meat with the blood still in it.
c28823	Then someone reported to Saul:
c28824	said Saul.
c28825	“Look, the troops are sinning against the LORD
c28826	by eating meat with the blood still in it.”
c28828	“You have broken faith,”
c28829	“Roll a large stone over here at once.”
c28830	Then he said,
c28831	“Go among the troops
c28832	and tell them,
c28833	must bring me
c28834	‘Each man ... his ox
c28835	or his sheep,
c28836	slaughter [them] in this [place],
c28837	and then eat.
c28838	Do not sin against the LORD
c28839	by eating meat with the blood still in it.’”
c28840	So that night everyone brought his ox
c28841	and slaughtered it there.
c28842	Then Saul built an altar to the LORD;
c28843	it was the first
c28844	time he had built an altar to the LORD.
c28845	And Saul said,
c28846	“Let us go down after the Philistines by night
c28847	and plunder
c28848	them until dawn,
c28849	leaving no man [alive]!”
c28850	the troops replied.
c28851	whatever
c28852	seems good to you,”
c28853	“Do
c28854	But the priest said,
c28855	“We must consult God here.”
c28856	So Saul inquired of God,
c28857	“Shall I go down after the Philistines?
c28858	Will You give them into the hand of Israel?”
c28859	But God did not answer him that day.
c28860	Therefore Saul said,
c28861	“Come here,
c28862	all you leaders of the troops,
c28863	and let us investigate
c28865	how this sin has occurred today.
c28866	As surely as the LORD lives ... even
c28867	who delivers Israel,
c28868	if it is my son Jonathan,
c28869	he must die!”
c28870	But not one of the troops said a word.
c28871	Then Saul said to all Israel,
c28872	“You stand on one side,
c28873	and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.”
c28874	And the troops replied,
c28875	what seems good to you.”
c28876	“Do
c28877	So Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel,
c28878	“[Why have You not answered Your servant this day? If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim; but if the fault is with the men of Israel,] respond with Thummim.”
c28879	And Jonathan and Saul were selected,
c28880	but the people were cleared of the charge.
c28881	Then Saul said,
c28882	“Cast [the lot] between me and my son Jonathan.”
c28883	And Jonathan was selected.
c28884	Saul commanded him.
c28885	“Tell
c28886	me what you have done,”
c28887	So Jonathan told him,
c28889	“I only tasted ... with the end of the staff
c28890	that [was] in my hand.
c28891	a little honey
c28892	And now I must die?”
c28893	And Saul declared
c28894	“May God punish me,
c28895	and ever so severely,
c28896	do not surely die!”
c28897	if you, Jonathan,
c28898	But the people said to Saul,
c28899	“Must Jonathan die—
c28900	he who accomplished such a great deliverance for Israel?
c28901	Never!
c28902	As surely as the LORD lives,
c28903	not a hair of his head will fall to the ground,
c28904	for with God’s help he has accomplished this today.”
c28905	So the people rescued Jonathan,
c28906	and he did not die.
c28907	Then Saul gave up his pursuit of the Philistines,
c28908	and the Philistines returned to their own land.
c28909	After Saul had assumed the kingship over Israel,
c28910	he fought against all his enemies on every side— the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines.
c28911	Wherever
c28912	he turned,
c28913	he routed them.
c28914	He fought valiantly
c28915	and defeated the Amalekites,
c28916	delivering Israel from the hands of its plunderers.
c28917	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua.
c28918	His two daughters
c28919	were named Merab (his firstborn)
c28920	and Michal (his younger daughter).
c28921	His wife's name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz.
c28922	The name of the commander of his army was Abner, son of Saul’s uncle Ner.
c28923	Saul’s father Kish
c28924	and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel.
c28925	And the war with the Philistines was fierce for all the days of Saul.
c28926	So whenever [he] noticed any strong or brave man,
c28927	he would enlist him.
c28928	Then Samuel said to Saul,
c28929	“The LORD sent me
c28930	to anoint you king over His people Israel.
c28931	Now therefore,
c28932	listen to the words of the LORD.
c28933	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c28934	‘I witnessed
c28935	what the Amalekites did to the Israelites
c28936	when they hindered them on their way
c28937	up from Egypt.
c28938	Now
c28939	go
c28940	and attack the Amalekites
c28941	and completely destroy all
c28942	that belongs to them.
c28943	Do not spare them,
c28944	but put to death men and women, children and infants, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.’”
c28945	So Saul summoned the troops
c28946	and numbered them at Telaim—
c28947	200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah.
c28948	Saul came to the city of Amalek
c28949	and lay in wait in the valley.
c28950	And he warned the Kenites,
c28951	go on
c28953	and get away from the Amalekites.
c28954	to ... Otherwise I will sweep you away
c28955	“Since you showed kindness ... all the Israelites ... with them.”
c28956	when they came up out of Egypt,
c28957	So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
c28958	Then Saul struck down the Amalekites ... from Havilah
c28959	all the way ... to Shur,
c28960	which is east of Egypt.
c28961	He captured Agag king of Amalek alive,
c28962	but completely destroyed all the others with the sword.
c28963	Saul and his troops spared Agag, along with the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs, and the best of everything else.
c28964	They were unwilling
c28965	to destroy them,
c28966	all that was despised and worthless.
c28967	but they utterly destroyed
c28968	Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel,
c28969	saying,
c28970	“I regret
c28971	that I have made Saul king,
c28972	for he has turned away from following Me
c28973	and has not carried out My instructions.”
c28974	And Samuel was distressed
c28975	and cried out to the LORD all that night.
c28976	Samuel got up
c28977	to confront Saul,
c28978	Early in the morning
c28979	but [he] was told,
c28981	“Saul has gone to Carmel,
c28982	and behold, he has set up a monument for himself
c28983	and has turned
c28985	and gone down to Gilgal.”
c28986	When Samuel reached him,
c28987	Saul said to him,
c28988	“May the LORD bless you.
c28989	I have carried out the LORD’s instructions.”
c28990	But Samuel replied,
c28991	“Then what [is] this bleating of sheep
c28992	and lowing of cattle
c28993	I hear?”
c28994	Saul answered,
c28995	brought them from the Amalekites;
c28996	“The troops ... they spared the best sheep and cattle
c28997	to sacrifice to the LORD your God,
c28998	but the rest we utterly destroyed.”
c28999	exclaimed Samuel.
c29000	“Stop!”
c29001	“Let me tell
c29002	you what the LORD said to me last night.”
c29003	Saul replied.
c29004	“Tell me,”
c29005	And Samuel said,
c29006	not
c29007	“Although you [were once] small in your own eyes,
c29008	have you ... become the head of the tribes of Israel?
c29009	The LORD anointed you king over Israel
c29010	and sent you on a mission,
c29011	saying,
c29012	‘Go
c29013	and completely destroy the sinful Amalekites.
c29014	Fight against them
c29015	until you have wiped them out.’
c29016	So why did you not obey the LORD?
c29017	Why did you rush upon the plunder
c29018	and do
c29019	evil in the sight of the LORD?”
c29020	Saul replied.
c29021	“But I did obey the LORD,”
c29022	“I went on the mission
c29023	that the LORD gave me.
c29024	I brought back Agag king of Amalek
c29025	and utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
c29026	The troops took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of which was devoted to destruction
c29027	to sacrifice to the LORD your God at Gilgal.”
c29028	But Samuel declared:
c29029	“Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices
c29030	as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD?
c29031	Behold,
c29032	obedience
c29033	is better than sacrifice,
c29034	[and] attentiveness
c29035	is better than the fat of rams.
c29036	For rebellion is like the sin of divination, ... is like the wickedness
c29037	and arrogance ... of idolatry.
c29038	Because you have rejected the word of the LORD,
c29039	He has rejected you as king.”
c29040	Then Saul said to Samuel,
c29041	“I have sinned;
c29042	I have transgressed the LORD’s commandment and your instructions,
c29043	because I feared the people
c29044	and obeyed their voice.
c29045	Now therefore,
c29046	please forgive my sin
c29047	and return with me
c29048	so I can worship the LORD.”
c29049	Samuel replied.
c29050	“I will not return with you,”
c29051	“For you have rejected the word of the LORD,
c29052	and [He] has rejected you
c29053	as king over Israel.”
c29054	As Samuel turned
c29055	to go,
c29056	Saul grabbed the hem of his robe,
c29057	and it tore.
c29058	So Samuel said to him,
c29059	“The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today
c29060	and has given it to your neighbor
c29061	who is better than you.
c29062	Moreover, the Glory of Israel does not lie
c29063	or change His mind, ... is not
c29064	for He ... a man,
c29065	that He should change His mind.”
c29066	Saul replied.
c29067	“I have sinned,”
c29068	“Please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel.
c29069	Come back with me,
c29070	so that I may worship the LORD your God.”
c29071	So Samuel went back with Saul,
c29072	and Saul worshiped the LORD.
c29073	Then Samuel said,
c29074	“Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.”
c29075	Agag came to him cheerfully,
c29076	for he thought,
c29077	“Surely the bitterness of death is past.”
c29078	But Samuel declared:
c29079	“As your sword has made women childless,
c29080	so your mother will be childless among women.”
c29081	And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal.
c29082	Then Samuel went to Ramah,
c29083	but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.
c29084	Samuel never again
c29085	And to the day of his death, ... visited Saul.
c29086	Samuel mourned for Saul,
c29087	and the LORD regretted
c29088	He had made Saul king over Israel.
c29089	Now the LORD said to Samuel,
c29090	“How long are you going to mourn for Saul,
c29091	since I have rejected him
c29092	as king over Israel?
c29093	Fill your horn with oil
c29094	and go.
c29095	I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem,
c29096	for I have selected from his sons a king for Myself.”
c29097	Samuel asked.
c29098	“How can I go?”
c29099	“Saul will hear of it
c29100	and kill me!”
c29101	The LORD answered,
c29102	“Take a heifer with you
c29103	and say,
c29104	to sacrifice to the LORD.’
c29105	‘I have come
c29106	Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice,
c29107	and I will show you
c29108	what you are to do.
c29109	You are to anoint for Me
c29110	the one I indicate.”
c29111	So Samuel did
c29112	what the LORD had said
c29113	and went to Bethlehem.
c29114	When the elders of the town ... they trembled
c29115	met him,
c29116	and asked,
c29117	in peace?”
c29118	“Do you come
c29119	he replied.
c29120	“In peace,”
c29121	to sacrifice to the LORD.
c29122	“I have come
c29123	Consecrate yourselves
c29124	and come with me to the sacrifice.”
c29125	Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons
c29126	and invited them to the sacrifice.
c29128	When they arrived,
c29129	Samuel saw Eliab
c29130	and said,
c29131	“Surely here before the LORD [is His] anointed.”
c29132	But the LORD said to Samuel,
c29133	“Do not look at his appearance or height,
c29134	for I have rejected him;
c29135	[the LORD does] not [see]
c29136	as man does.
c29137	For man sees the outward appearance,
c29138	but the LORD sees the heart.”
c29139	Then Jesse called Abinadab
c29140	and presented him to Samuel,
c29141	who said,
c29142	“The LORD has not chosen this one either.”
c29143	Next Jesse presented Shammah,
c29144	but Samuel said,
c29145	“The LORD has not chosen this one either.”
c29146	Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel,
c29147	but Samuel told him,
c29148	“The LORD has not chosen any of these.”
c29149	And Samuel asked him,
c29150	“Are these all the sons you have?”
c29151	Jesse replied,
c29152	“There is still the youngest,”
c29153	“but he is tending the sheep.”
c29154	Samuel replied.
c29155	“Send for
c29156	him,”
c29157	“For we will not sit down [to eat]
c29158	until he arrives.”
c29159	So Jesse sent for [his youngest son]
c29160	and brought him in.
c29161	He [was] ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance.
c29162	And the LORD said,
c29163	“Rise
c29164	[and] anoint him,
c29165	for he is the one.”
c29166	So Samuel took the horn of oil
c29167	and anointed him in the presence of his brothers,
c29168	and the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward.
c29169	Then Samuel set out
c29170	and went to Ramah.
c29171	After the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul,
c29172	a spirit of distress from the LORD began to torment him.
c29173	Saul's servants said to him,
c29174	“Surely a spirit of distress from God is tormenting you.
c29175	Let our lord command your servants here
c29176	to seek out someone
c29177	who can skillfully
c29178	play the harp.
c29180	Whenever the spirit of distress from God is upon you,
c29181	he is to play it,
c29182	and you [will be] well.”
c29183	And Saul commanded his servants, ... him to me.”
c29184	“Find me someone
c29185	well,
c29186	who plays
c29187	and bring
c29188	One of the servants answered,
c29191	“I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem
c29192	who knows
c29193	how to play [the harp].
c29194	He is a mighty man of valor, a warrior, eloquent and handsome,
c29195	and the LORD is with him.”
c29196	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse
c29197	and said,
c29198	“Send me your son David,
c29199	who is with the sheep.”
c29200	And Jesse took a donkey [loaded with] bread, a skin of wine, and one young goat,
c29201	and sent them to Saul with his son David.
c29202	When David came to Saul
c29203	and entered his service,
c29204	Saul admired him greatly,
c29205	and David became his armor-bearer.
c29206	Then Saul sent word to Jesse,
c29207	saying,
c29208	“Let David remain in my service,
c29209	for I am pleased with him.”
c29210	And whenever
c29211	the spirit from God came upon Saul,
c29212	David would pick up his harp
c29213	and play,
c29214	and Saul would become
c29215	well,
c29216	and the spirit of distress would depart from him.
c29217	Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war
c29218	at Socoh
c29219	in Judah
c29220	and camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim.
c29221	Saul and the men of Israel assembled
c29222	and camped in the Valley of Elah,
c29223	arraying themselves for battle
c29224	against the Philistines.
c29225	The Philistines stood on one hill
c29226	and the Israelites stood on another,
c29227	with the valley between them.
c29228	Then a champion ... came out from the Philistine camp.
c29229	named Goliath,
c29230	who was from Gath,
c29231	He was six cubits and a span in height,
c29232	and he wore a bronze helmet
c29233	coat of mail
c29234	and bronze ... weighing five thousand shekels.
c29235	[He had] armor of bronze on his legs,
c29236	and a bronze javelin was slung between his shoulders.
c29237	The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's rod,
c29238	and its iron point [weighed] six hundred shekels.
c29239	In addition, his shield bearer went before him.
c29240	And [Goliath] stood
c29241	and shouted to the ranks of Israel,
c29243	“Why do you come out
c29244	and array yourselves for battle?
c29245	Am I not a Philistine,
c29246	and are you not servants of Saul?
c29247	Choose one of your men
c29248	and have him come down against me.
c29249	If he is able
c29250	to fight me
c29251	and kill me,
c29252	then we will be your servants.
c29253	But if I prevail against him
c29254	and kill him,
c29255	then you shall be our servants
c29256	and labor for us.”
c29257	Then the Philistine said,
c29258	“I defy the ranks of Israel this day!
c29259	Give me a man
c29260	to fight!”
c29261	On hearing the words of the Philistine, Saul and all the Israelites
c29262	were dismayed
c29263	and greatly afraid.
c29264	Now David was the son of a man ... an Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah
c29265	named Jesse,
c29266	who had eight sons
c29267	in the days of Saul. And Jesse was old
c29268	and advanced [in years].
c29269	The three older sons of Jesse had followed
c29270	Saul to the war:
c29273	The firstborn [was] Eliab,
c29274	the second [was] Abinadab,
c29275	and the third [was] Shammah.
c29276	And David
c29277	was the youngest.
c29278	The three oldest had followed Saul,
c29279	but David went back and forth
c29280	from Saul
c29281	to tend his father’s sheep in Bethlehem.
c29282	the Philistine came forward every morning and evening
c29283	For forty days ... to take his stand.
c29284	One day Jesse said to his son David,
c29285	“Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten [loaves] of bread for your brothers
c29286	and hurry to their camp.
c29287	Take also these ten portions of cheese to the commander of [their] unit.
c29288	Check on the welfare of your brothers
c29289	and bring back an assurance from them.
c29290	They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah,
c29291	fighting against the Philistines.”
c29292	So David got up early in the morning,
c29293	left the flock with a keeper,
c29294	loaded up,
c29295	and set out
c29296	as Jesse had instructed him.
c29297	He reached the camp
c29298	as the army
c29299	was marching out to its position
c29300	and shouting the battle cry.
c29301	And Israel and the Philistines arrayed in formation
c29302	against each other.
c29303	Then David left his supplies in the care of the quartermaster
c29304	and ran to the battle line.
c29305	When he arrived,
c29306	he asked his brothers how they were doing.
c29307	And as he was speaking with them,
c29308	suddenly
c29309	the champion ... came forward
c29310	named Goliath, the Philistine
c29311	from Gath,
c29312	from the Philistines
c29313	and shouted his usual words, which
c29314	David also heard.
c29315	When all the men of Israel
c29316	saw Goliath,
c29317	they fled from him
c29318	in great fear.
c29319	Now the men of Israel had been saying,
c29320	“Do you see this man who keeps coming out
c29322	to defy Israel?
c29325	To the man
c29326	who kills him
c29327	the king will give great riches.
c29328	And he will give him his daughter in marriage
c29329	and exempt his father's house from taxation in Israel.”
c29330	David asked
c29331	who were standing with him,
c29333	the men ... “What will be done
c29334	for the man who kills this Philistine
c29335	and removes this disgrace from Israel?
c29336	Just who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that
c29337	he should defy the armies of the living God?”
c29338	The people told him about the offer,
c29339	saying,
c29340	“That is what will be done for the man
c29341	who kills him.”
c29342	Now when David’s oldest brother Eliab heard
c29343	him speaking to the men,
c29344	his anger burned against David.
c29345	he asked.
c29346	“Why have you come down here?”
c29347	“And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness?
c29348	I know your pride and wickedness of heart—
c29350	to see the battle!”
c29351	you have come down
c29352	said David.
c29353	“What have I done now?”
c29354	“Was it not just a question?”
c29355	Then he turned from him toward another
c29356	and asked about the offer,
c29357	and those people answered just as the first ones.
c29358	were overheard
c29359	Now David's words
c29360	and reported to Saul,
c29361	who called for him.
c29362	David said to Saul,
c29363	“Let no man's heart fail on account of
c29364	Your servant will go
c29365	this Philistine. ... and fight him!”
c29366	But Saul replied,
c29367	“You cannot
c29368	go out against this Philistine
c29369	to fight him.
c29370	You are just a boy,
c29371	and he has been a warrior from his youth.”
c29372	David replied,
c29373	“Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep,
c29374	and whenever a lion or a bear came
c29375	and carried off a lamb from the flock,
c29376	I went after it,
c29377	struck it down,
c29378	and delivered [the lamb] from its mouth.
c29379	If it reared up against me,
c29380	I would grab it by its fur,
c29381	strike it down,
c29382	and kill it.
c29383	Your servant has killed lions and bears;
c29384	this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them,
c29385	for he has defied the armies of the living God.”
c29386	David added,
c29387	“The LORD
c29388	who delivered me from the claws of the lion [and] the bear
c29389	will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.”
c29390	said Saul,
c29391	“Go,”
c29392	“and may the LORD be with you.”
c29393	Then Saul clothed David in his own tunic,
c29394	put a bronze helmet on his head,
c29395	and dressed him in armor.
c29396	David strapped his sword over the tunic
c29397	and tried
c29398	to walk,
c29399	but he was not used to [all this armor].
c29400	David said to Saul.
c29401	“I cannot
c29402	walk in these,”
c29403	“I am not used to them.”
c29404	So David took them off.
c29405	And [David] took his staff in his hand,
c29406	selected five smooth stones from the brook,
c29407	and put ... of his shepherd’s bag.
c29409	them in the pouch
c29410	And with his sling in hand,
c29411	he approached the Philistine.
c29412	Now the Philistine came
c29414	closer
c29415	and closer to David,
c29416	with his shield-bearer
c29418	before him.
c29419	When the Philistine looked
c29420	and saw David,
c29421	he despised
c29422	him because he was just a boy,
c29423	ruddy and handsome.
c29424	he said to David,
c29425	“Am I a dog,”
c29426	“that you come at me with sticks?”
c29427	And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
c29428	here,” he called to David,
c29429	“Come
c29430	“and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!”
c29431	But David said to the Philistine,
c29432	“You come against me with a dagger, spear, and sword,
c29433	but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,
c29434	whom you have defied.
c29435	This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand.
c29436	I will strike you down,
c29437	cut off your head,
c29438	This day ... and give the carcasses of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the creatures of the earth.
c29439	Then the whole world will know
c29440	that there is a God in Israel.
c29441	And all those assembled here will know
c29442	that it is not by sword or by spear that the LORD saves;
c29443	for the battle [is] the LORD's,
c29444	and He will give all of you into our hands.”
c29446	As the Philistine
c29447	started
c29448	forward
c29449	to attack him,
c29450	David ... quickly
c29451	ran ... toward the battle line
c29452	to meet him.
c29453	Then David reached into his bag,
c29454	took out a stone
c29455	and slung it,
c29456	striking the Philistine on the forehead.
c29457	The stone sank into his forehead,
c29458	and he fell facedown on the ground.
c29459	Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone;
c29460	he struck down the Philistine
c29461	and killed him.
c29462	without a sword in his hand
c29463	David ran
c29464	and stood over him. ... the Philistine’s
c29465	He grabbed ... sword
c29466	and pulled it from its sheath.
c29467	And having killed him,
c29468	he cut off his head with [the sword].
c29469	When the Philistines saw
c29470	that their hero was dead,
c29471	they turned and ran.
c29472	Then the men of Israel and Judah charged forward
c29473	with a shout
c29474	and pursued the Philistines
c29475	to the entrance of Gath
c29476	and to the gates of Ekron.
c29477	The bodies of the Philistines were strewn along the Shaaraim road
c29478	to Gath and Ekron.
c29479	When the Israelites returned
c29480	from their pursuit of the Philistines,
c29481	they plundered their camps.
c29482	David took the head of the Philistine
c29483	and brought it to Jerusalem,
c29484	but he put Goliath’s weapons in his own tent.
c29486	As Saul had watched David
c29487	going out
c29488	to confront the Philistine,
c29489	he said to Abner the commander of the army,
c29490	whose son is this young man?”
c29491	“Abner,
c29492	Abner replied,
c29493	“As surely as you live,
c29494	O king,”
c29495	“I do not know.”
c29496	said the king.
c29497	“Find out
c29498	whose son this young man is!”
c29499	So when David returned
c29500	from killing the Philistine,
c29501	Abner took him
c29502	and brought him before Saul.
c29503	still holding [his] head in his hand,
c29504	asked Saul.
c29505	“Whose son are you,
c29506	young man?”
c29507	David replied.
c29508	“[I am] the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem,”
c29509	After
c29510	David had finished
c29511	speaking with Saul,
c29512	the souls of Jonathan and David were knit together,
c29513	and Jonathan loved him as himself.
c29514	And from that day Saul kept David with him
c29515	and did not let
c29516	him return to his father’s house.
c29517	Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.
c29518	And Jonathan removed the robe
c29519	he was wearing
c29520	and gave it to David,
c29521	along with his tunic, his sword, his bow, and his belt.
c29522	So David marched out
c29523	in everything
c29524	Saul sent him to do,
c29525	[and] prospered
c29526	and Saul set him over the men of war.
c29527	And this was pleasing in the sight of all the people and of Saul's officers as well.
c29528	As the troops
c29530	were returning home after David
c29531	had killed the Philistine,
c29532	the women came out of all the cities of Israel
c29533	with singing
c29534	and dancing,
c29535	to meet King Saul
c29536	with joyful songs, and with tambourines and other musical instruments.
c29537	And as the women danced, they sang out:
c29539	“Saul has slain [his] thousands,
c29540	and David his tens of thousands.”
c29541	And Saul was furious
c29542	and resented this song.
c29543	he said,
c29544	“They have ascribed tens of thousands to David,”
c29545	“but only thousands to me.
c29546	What more can he have but the kingdom?”
c29547	And from that day forward Saul kept a jealous eye on David.
c29548	The next day
c29549	a spirit of distress sent from God came upon Saul,
c29550	and he prophesied inside the house
c29551	while David played [the harp] as usual. ... was holding
c29552	Now Saul ... a spear,
c29553	and he hurled it,
c29554	thinking,
c29555	“I will pin David to the wall.”
c29556	But David eluded him twice.
c29557	So Saul was afraid of David,
c29558	because the LORD was with David
c29559	but had departed from Saul.
c29560	Therefore Saul sent [David] away
c29561	and gave him command of a thousand men.
c29562	David led
c29563	the troops {out to battle} and back,
c29564	and he continued to prosper in all his ways,
c29565	because the LORD was with him.
c29566	When Saul saw
c29567	that David was very successful,
c29568	he was afraid of him.
c29569	But all Israel and Judah loved David,
c29570	because he was leading them out to battle
c29571	and back.
c29572	Then Saul said to David,
c29573	“Here is my oldest daughter Merab.
c29574	I will give her to you in marriage.
c29575	Only be valiant for me
c29576	and fight the LORD's battles.”
c29577	But Saul was thinking,
c29578	“vvv I need not raise my hand against him;
c29579	let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”
c29580	And David said to Saul,
c29581	“Who am I,
c29582	and what is my family or my father’s clan in Israel,
c29583	that I should become the son-in-law of the king?”
c29584	So when it was time
c29585	to give Saul’s daughter Merab to David,
c29586	she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.
c29587	Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David,
c29588	and when this was reported to Saul,
c29589	it pleased him.
c29590	Saul thought,
c29591	“I will give her to [David],”
c29592	“so that she may be a snare to him,
c29593	and the hand of the Philistines may be against him.”
c29594	So Saul said to David,
c29595	“For a second [time] now you can be my son-in-law.”
c29596	Then Saul ordered his servants,
c29597	“Speak to David privately
c29598	and tell him,
c29599	‘Behold, the king is pleased with you,
c29600	and all his servants love you.
c29601	Now therefore, become his son-in-law.’”
c29602	But when Saul's servants relayed these words to David,
c29603	he replied,
c29604	“Does it seem trivial in your sight
c29605	to be the son-in-law of the king?
c29606	I am a poor man and lightly esteemed.”
c29607	And the servants told Saul
c29609	what David had said.
c29610	Saul replied,
c29611	“Say to David,
c29612	‘The king desires no other dowry
c29613	but a hundred Philistine foreskins
c29614	as revenge on his enemies.’”
c29615	But Saul intended
c29616	to cause David’s death at the hands of the Philistines.
c29617	When the servants reported these terms to David,
c29618	he was pleased
c29619	to become the king’s son-in-law.
c29620	Before the wedding day arrived,
c29621	David
c29622	and his men went out
c29623	and killed two hundred Philistines.
c29624	He brought their foreskins
c29625	and presented them as payment in full ... the king's
c29626	to become ... son-in-law.
c29627	Then Saul gave his daughter Michal to David {in marriage}.
c29628	When Saul realized
c29630	that the LORD was with David
c29631	and that his daughter Michal loved [David],
c29632	he grew even more
c29633	afraid of David.
c29634	So from then on Saul was David’s enemy.
c29635	the Philistine commanders came out [for battle],
c29637	Every time
c29638	David was more successful than all of Saul’s officers,
c29639	so that his name was highly esteemed.
c29640	Then Saul ordered his son Jonathan and all his servants
c29641	to kill David.
c29642	But Jonathan delighted greatly in David,
c29643	so he warned David,
c29644	saying,
c29645	“My father Saul intends
c29646	to kill you.
c29648	Be on your guard in the morning;
c29649	find a secret place
c29650	and hide there.
c29651	I will go out
c29652	and stand beside my father in the field
c29653	where you [are],
c29654	so I can ask about you.
c29655	And if I find out anything,
c29656	I will tell you.”
c29657	Then Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul
c29658	and said to him,
c29659	“The king should not sin against his servant David;
c29660	he has not sinned against you. In fact,
c29661	his actions [have been] highly beneficial to you.
c29662	He took his life in his hands
c29663	when he struck down the Philistine,
c29664	and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel.
c29665	You saw
c29666	it and rejoiced,
c29667	so why would you sin against innocent blood
c29668	by killing David for no reason?”
c29669	Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan
c29670	and swore an oath:
c29671	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c29672	David will not be put to death.”
c29673	So Jonathan summoned David
c29674	and told him all these things. Then Jonathan
c29675	brought David to Saul
c29676	to serve him as he had before.
c29677	When war ... again,
c29678	broke out
c29679	David went out
c29680	and fought the Philistines
c29681	and struck them with such a mighty blow
c29682	that they fled before him.
c29683	a spirit of distress from the LORD came upon him.
c29684	But as Saul was sitting in his house
c29685	with his spear in his hand,
c29686	While David was playing the harp,
c29687	Saul tried
c29688	to pin him to the wall with his spear.
c29689	eluded [him],
c29690	But the spear struck the wall
c29691	and David ... ran away,
c29692	and escaped that night.
c29693	Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house
c29694	to watch him
c29695	and kill him in the morning.
c29696	But David's wife Michal warned [him],
c29698	“If you do not run for your life tonight,
c29699	tomorrow you will be dead!”
c29700	So Michal lowered David from the window,
c29702	and he ran away
c29703	and escaped.
c29704	Then Michal took a household idol
c29705	and laid [it] in the bed,
c29706	placed some goat hair on its head,
c29707	and covered it with a garment.
c29708	When Saul sent the messengers
c29709	to seize David,
c29710	Michal said,
c29711	“He [is] ill.”
c29712	But Saul sent the messengers back
c29713	to see David
c29714	and told them,
c29715	“Bring him up to me in his bed,
c29716	so I can kill him.”
c29717	And when the messengers entered,
c29718	there was
c29719	the idol in the bed
c29720	with the quilt of goats' [hair] on its head.
c29721	And Saul said to Michal,
c29722	“Why did you deceive me like this?
c29723	You have sent my enemy away,
c29724	and he has escaped!”
c29725	Michal replied,
c29726	“He said to me,
c29727	‘Help me get away,
c29728	or I will kill you!’”
c29729	So David ran away
c29730	and escaped.
c29731	And he went to Samuel at Ramah
c29732	and told him all
c29733	that Saul had done to him.
c29734	Then he and Samuel went to
c29735	Naioth and stayed [there].
c29736	When it was reported to Saul
c29739	that David was at Naioth in Ramah,
c29740	he sent messengers
c29741	to capture him.
c29742	But when they saw the group of prophets
c29743	prophesying,
c29744	with Samuel
c29745	leading them, ... them,
c29746	the Spirit of God came upon ... and Saul’s messengers
c29747	also began to prophesy.
c29748	When this was reported to Saul,
c29749	he sent more messengers,
c29750	but they began to prophesy as well.
c29751	So Saul tried again
c29752	and sent messengers a third [time],
c29753	and even they began to prophesy.
c29754	Finally, Saul himself left for Ramah
c29755	and came to the large cistern
c29756	at Secu,
c29757	where he asked,
c29758	he was told.
c29759	“Where are Samuel and David?”
c29761	“At Naioth in Ramah,”
c29762	So Saul went to Naioth in Ramah.
c29763	But the Spirit of God came upon even [Saul],
c29764	and he walked along
c29766	prophesying
c29767	until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
c29768	Then Saul stripped off his robes and also
c29769	prophesied before Samuel.
c29770	And he collapsed and lay naked all that day and night.
c29771	That is why it is said,
c29772	“Is Saul also among the prophets?”
c29773	Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah.
c29774	He came
c29775	to Jonathan and asked,
c29776	“What have I done?
c29777	What [is] my iniquity?
c29778	How have I sinned against your father,
c29779	that he wants to take my life?”
c29780	Jonathan replied.
c29781	“Far from it!”
c29782	“You will not die.
c29783	Indeed, my father does nothing, great or small, ... matter
c29784	without telling me.
c29785	So why would he hide this ... from me?
c29786	This cannot be true!”
c29787	But David again vowed,
c29789	“Your father knows very well
c29790	that I have found favor in your eyes,
c29791	and he has said,
c29792	‘Jonathan must not know of this,
c29793	or he will be grieved.’
c29794	As surely as
c29795	the LORD lives
c29796	and as you yourself live,
c29797	there is but a step between me and death.”
c29798	Then Jonathan said to David,
c29799	“Whatever you desire,
c29800	I will do for you.”
c29801	So David told him,
c29802	“Look,
c29803	tomorrow is the New Moon,
c29804	and I am supposed to dine with the king.
c29806	Instead, let me go
c29807	and hide in the field until the third evening {from now}.
c29808	If your father misses me at all,
c29809	tell him,
c29810	‘David urgently requested my [permission]
c29811	to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown,
c29812	because there is an annual sacrifice for his whole clan.’
c29813	If he says,
c29814	‘Good,’
c29815	then your servant is safe,
c29816	but if he is enraged,
c29817	you will know
c29818	he has evil intentions.
c29819	Therefore deal faithfully with your servant,
c29820	for you have brought me into a covenant with you before the LORD.
c29821	If there is iniquity in me,
c29822	then kill me yourself;
c29824	me to your father?”
c29825	why should you bring
c29826	Jonathan replied.
c29827	“Never!”
c29829	“If I ever found out
c29830	my father has evil intentions
c29831	against you,
c29832	would I not tell you?”
c29833	Then David asked Jonathan,
c29834	“Who will tell
c29835	me if your father answers you harshly?”
c29836	he replied,
c29837	“Come,”
c29838	“let us go out to the field.”
c29839	So the two of them went out into the field,
c29840	and Jonathan said, ... toward you,
c29841	“By the LORD, the God of Israel,
c29842	I will sound out my father by this time tomorrow or the next day.
c29843	If he is favorable ... for you
c29844	will I not send
c29845	and tell you?
c29846	then may the LORD punish me,
c29847	and ever so severely,
c29848	But if my father intends to bring evil on you,
c29849	if I do not tell you
c29850	and send you on your way
c29851	in safety.
c29852	May the LORD be with you,
c29853	just as He has been with my father.
c29854	And
c29855	as long as I live,
c29856	treat me with the LORD’s loving devotion
c29857	that I may not die,
c29858	and do not ever cut off your loving devotion from my household—
c29859	not
c29860	even when the LORD cuts off ... of David’s enemies
c29861	every one ... from the face of the earth.”
c29862	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying,
c29863	“May the LORD hold David’s enemies accountable.”
c29864	And Jonathan ... reaffirm
c29865	had David ... his vow out of love for him,
c29866	for [Jonathan] loved [David] as he loved himself.
c29867	Then Jonathan said to David,
c29868	“Tomorrow is the New Moon,
c29869	and you will be missed
c29870	if your seat is empty.
c29871	[When] you have stayed three days,
c29872	hurry down
c29873	to the place
c29874	you hid on the day this trouble began,
c29875	and remain beside the stone Ezel.
c29876	I will shoot three arrows to the side of it,
c29877	as if I were aiming at a target.
c29878	Then I will send a boy [and say], ... ‘Look,
c29879	‘Go,
c29880	find the arrows!’
c29881	Now, if I expressly say to him,
c29882	the arrows are on this side of you;
c29883	bring them,’
c29884	then come,
c29885	because ... it is safe for you
c29886	and there is no danger.
c29887	as surely as the LORD lives,
c29888	But if I say to the young man,
c29889	‘Look, the arrows [are] beyond you,’ then
c29890	you must go,
c29891	for the LORD has sent you away.
c29892	And as for the matter
c29893	you and I have discussed,
c29894	the LORD is a witness between you and me forever.”
c29895	So David hid in the field,
c29896	and when the New Moon had come,
c29897	the king sat down
c29898	to eat.
c29899	He sat in his usual place by the wall,
c29900	opposite Jonathan
c29901	and beside Abner,
c29902	but David’s place was empty.
c29903	Saul said nothing that day
c29904	because he thought,
c29905	“Something has happened to [David]
c29906	to make him ceremonially unclean— ... he [is]
c29907	surely ... unclean.”
c29908	But on the day after the New Moon, the second [day],
c29909	David’s place was still empty,
c29910	and Saul asked his son Jonathan, ... to
c29911	“Why hasn't the son of Jesse come ... the meal either yesterday or today?”
c29912	Jonathan answered,
c29913	“David urgently requested my permission to go to Bethlehem,
c29914	saying,
c29915	‘Please let me go
c29916	because our clan is holding a sacrifice in the city,
c29918	and my brother has told me to be there.
c29919	So now,
c29920	if I have found favor in your eyes,
c29921	please let me go
c29922	and see my brothers.’
c29923	That is why he did not come to the king’s table.”
c29924	Then Saul's anger burned against Jonathan,
c29925	and he said to him,
c29926	“You son of a perverse and rebellious woman!
c29927	Do I not know
c29928	that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the disgrace of the mother who bore you?
c29929	Every day
c29930	the son of Jesse lives on earth,
c29931	neither you nor your kingship shall be established.
c29932	Now
c29933	send for him
c29934	and bring him to me,
c29935	for he must surely die!”
c29936	Jonathan replied.
c29938	“Why must he be put to death?
c29939	“What has he done?”
c29940	Then Saul hurled his spear at [Jonathan]
c29941	to kill him;
c29942	so Jonathan knew
c29943	that his father was determined
c29944	to kill David.
c29945	Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger
c29946	and did not eat any food that second day of the month,
c29947	for he was grieved ... of David.
c29948	by his father’s shameful treatment
c29949	In the morning
c29950	Jonathan went out to the field for the appointment with David,
c29951	and a small boy was with him.
c29952	He said to the boy,
c29953	“Run
c29954	and find ... an arrow
c29955	[the arrows] I shoot.”
c29956	And as the boy ran,
c29957	Jonathan shot
c29958	beyond him.
c29959	When the boy reached the place where ... arrow
c29960	Jonathan's ... had fallen,
c29961	Jonathan called to him,
c29963	“Isn't the arrow beyond you?”
c29964	Then Jonathan cried out,
c29965	“Hurry! Make haste!
c29966	Do not delay!”
c29967	So the boy picked up the arrow
c29968	and returned to his master.
c29969	But the boy did not know anything;
c29970	only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement.
c29971	Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the boy
c29973	and said,
c29974	“Go,
c29975	take it back to the city.”
c29976	When the young man had gone,
c29977	David got up from the south side [of the stone],
c29978	fell facedown,
c29979	and bowed three times.
c29980	Then he and Jonathan kissed
c29981	each other
c29982	and wept
c29983	together—
c29984	though David wept more.
c29985	And Jonathan said to David,
c29986	“Go in peace,
c29987	for the two of us have sworn in the name of the LORD when we
c29988	said,
c29989	‘May the LORD be a witness between you and me, and between your descendants and mine forever.’”
c29990	Then David got up
c29991	and departed,
c29992	and Jonathan went back into the city.
c29993	Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest.
c29994	And when Ahimelech ... he trembled
c29995	met David,
c29996	and asked him,
c29997	“Why [are] you alone?
c29998	Why is no one with you?”
c29999	David replied.
c30000	“The king has ordered me on some business,”
c30001	“He told me
c30002	no one is to know about the mission
c30004	or instructions.
c30005	And I have directed [my] young men to meet me at a certain place.
c30006	Now then,
c30007	what do you have on hand?
c30008	Give [me] five [loaves of] bread,
c30009	or whatever can be found.”
c30010	the priest replied,
c30012	“[There is] no common bread on hand,”
c30013	“but there is some consecrated bread—
c30014	provided that the young men have kept themselves from women.”
c30015	David answered,
c30018	“Women [have] indeed [been] kept from us, as usual
c30019	when I set out.
c30020	And the equipment of the young men is holy,
c30021	as it [is] even on common missions,
c30022	and all the more at this time.”
c30023	So the priest gave him the consecrated [bread],
c30024	since there was no bread there
c30025	but the bread of the Presence,
c30026	which had been removed from before the LORD
c30027	and replaced with hot bread on the day
c30028	it was taken away.
c30029	Now one of Saul's servants was there that day,
c30030	detained before the LORD.
c30031	And his name [was] Doeg the Edomite, the chief shepherd
c30032	for Saul.
c30033	Then David asked Ahimelech,
c30034	“Is there not a spear or sword on hand here?
c30035	For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me,
c30036	because the king's business was urgent.”
c30037	The priest replied,
c30038	“The sword of Goliath the Philistine,
c30039	whom you killed in the Valley of Elah,
c30040	is here; it [is]
c30041	wrapped in a cloth
c30042	behind the ephod.
c30043	If you want, you may take.
c30045	For [there is] no other but this one.”
c30046	And David said,
c30047	“[There is] none like it;
c30048	give it to me.”
c30049	David
c30050	That day ... fled from Saul
c30051	and went to Achish king of Gath.
c30052	But the servants of Achish said to him,
c30053	“[Is] this not David, the king of the land?
c30054	Did they not sing about him in their dances,
c30055	saying:
c30056	‘Saul has slain [his] thousands,
c30057	and David [his] tens of thousands’?”
c30058	Now David took words these to heart
c30059	and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
c30060	So he changed his behavior before them
c30061	and feigned madness in their hands;
c30062	he scratched on the doors of the gate
c30063	and let his saliva run down his beard.
c30064	Then Achish said to his servants,
c30065	“Look, you can see the man is insane!
c30066	Why have you brought him to me?
c30067	Am I in need of madmen,
c30068	that you have brought this man
c30069	to rave in my presence?
c30070	Must this [man] come into my house?”
c30071	So David left [Gath]
c30072	and took refuge in the cave of Adullam.
c30073	When his brothers and the rest of his father's household heard about it,
c30074	they went down to him there.
c30075	And all who were distressed [or] ... rallied around him,
c30076	indebted
c30077	or discontented
c30078	and he became their leader.
c30079	About four hundred men were with him.
c30080	From there David went to Mizpeh of Moab,
c30081	where he said to the king of Moab,
c30082	“Please let my father and mother stay with you
c30083	until I learn
c30084	what God will do for me.”
c30085	So he left them in the care of the king of Moab,
c30086	and they stayed with him the whole time
c30087	David was in the stronghold.
c30088	Then the prophet Gad said to David,
c30089	“Do not stay in the stronghold.
c30090	Depart
c30091	and go into the land of Judah.”
c30092	So David left
c30093	and went to the forest of Hereth.
c30094	Soon Saul learned
c30095	that David ... had been discovered.
c30096	and his men
c30097	At that time, Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah,
c30098	with his spear in his hand
c30099	and all his servants standing around him.
c30100	Then Saul said to his servants,
c30102	“Listen,
c30103	men of Benjamin!
c30104	Is the son of Jesse giving all of you fields and vineyards
c30105	[and] making you commanders of thousands [or] hundreds?
c30106	Is that why all of you have conspired against me?
c30107	Not one [of you] told me that
c30108	my own son had made a covenant with Jesse’s son.
c30109	Not one of you has shown concern for me
c30110	or revealed to me
c30111	that my son has stirred up my own servant to lie in wait against me, as is the case today.”
c30112	But Doeg the Edomite, ... answered:
c30113	who had stationed himself with Saul’s servants,
c30115	“I saw the son of Jesse
c30116	come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.
c30117	Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him
c30118	and gave him provisions.
c30119	He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”
c30120	Then the king sent
c30121	messengers to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and his father’s whole family, ... were priests
c30122	who ... at Nob.
c30123	And all of them came to the king.
c30124	said Saul.
c30125	“Listen now,
c30126	son of Ahitub,”
c30127	he replied.
c30128	“Here I am,
c30129	my lord,”
c30130	And Saul asked him,
c30131	“Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me?
c30132	You gave him bread and a sword
c30133	and inquired of God for him
c30134	so that he could rise up against me to lie in wait, as he is doing today.”
c30135	Ahimelech answered the king,
c30137	“Who among all your servants ... as David,
c30138	is as faithful
c30139	the king’s son-in-law,
c30140	captain of your bodyguard,
c30141	[who is] honored in your house?
c30142	Was that day the first
c30143	time I inquired of God for him?
c30144	Far be it from me!
c30145	Let not the king accuse your servant or any of my father’s household,
c30146	for your servant knew nothing of this whole affair— not in part or in whole.”
c30147	But the king replied,
c30148	“You will surely die,
c30149	Ahimelech,
c30150	you and all your father's house!”
c30151	Then the king ordered the guards
c30152	at his side,
c30153	“Turn
c30154	and kill the priests of the LORD,
c30155	because they too sided with David. ... a hand
c30156	For they knew
c30157	he was fleeing,
c30158	but they did not tell me.”
c30159	But the king’s servants would not
c30160	lift
c30161	to strike the priests of the LORD.
c30162	So the king ordered Doeg,
c30163	“You turn
c30164	and strike down the priests!”
c30165	And Doeg the Edomite turned
c30166	and struck down the priests himself.
c30167	On that day he killed eighty-five men
c30168	who wore the linen ephod.
c30169	He also put to the sword Nob, the city of the priests, with its men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep.
c30170	But one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped.
c30171	His name was Abiathar,
c30172	and he fled to David.
c30173	And Abiathar told David
c30174	that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
c30175	Then David said to Abiathar,
c30176	“I knew ... that day,
c30177	that Doeg the Edomite was there ... and that
c30178	he was sure to tell Saul.
c30179	I myself am responsible for the lives of everyone in your father’s house.
c30180	Stay with me;
c30181	do not be afraid,
c30182	for
c30183	he who ... is seeking mine [as well].
c30184	seeks your life
c30185	You will be safe with me.”
c30186	Now it was reported to David,
c30188	“Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah
c30189	and looting the threshing floors.”
c30190	So David inquired of the LORD,
c30192	“Should I go
c30193	and attack these Philistines?”
c30194	And the LORD said to David,
c30195	“Go
c30196	and attack the Philistines
c30197	and deliver Keilah.”
c30198	But David’s men said to him,
c30199	“Look, we are afraid here in Judah;
c30200	how much more if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”
c30201	Once again, David
c30202	inquired of the LORD,
c30203	and the LORD answered him:
c30205	at once
c30206	“Go ... to Keilah,
c30207	for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”
c30208	Then David and his men went to Keilah,
c30209	fought against the Philistines,
c30210	and carried off their livestock,
c30211	striking them with a mighty blow.
c30212	So David rescued the people of Keilah.
c30213	(Now
c30214	Abiathar son of Ahimelech ... when he fled to David at Keilah.)
c30215	had brought the ephod with him
c30216	When it was reported to Saul
c30217	that David had gone to Keilah,
c30218	he said,
c30219	“God has delivered him into my hand,
c30220	for he has trapped himself
c30221	by entering a town with gates and bars.”
c30222	Then Saul summoned all his troops ... to war
c30223	to go ... at Keilah
c30224	and besiege David and his men.
c30225	When David learned
c30226	that Saul was plotting evil against him,
c30227	he said to Abiathar the priest,
c30228	“Bring the ephod.”
c30229	And David said,
c30230	“O LORD, God of Israel,
c30231	Your servant has heard
c30232	that Saul intends
c30233	to come to Keilah
c30234	and destroy the city on my account.
c30235	Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me into his hand?
c30236	Will Saul come down,
c30237	as Your servant has heard?
c30238	O LORD, God of Israel,
c30239	please tell Your servant.”
c30240	said the LORD.
c30241	“He will,”
c30242	So David asked,
c30243	“Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?”
c30244	answered the LORD.
c30245	“They will,”
c30246	Then David and his men, about six hundred [strong], set out
c30247	and departed from Keilah,
c30248	moving from place to place.
c30250	When it was reported to Saul
c30251	that David had escaped from Keilah,
c30252	he declined
c30253	to go forth.
c30254	And David stayed in the wilderness strongholds
c30255	and in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph.
c30256	Day after day Saul searched for him,
c30257	but God would not deliver [David] into his hand.
c30258	While David ... saw
c30259	that Saul had come out
c30260	to take his life.
c30261	was in Horesh in the Wilderness of Ziph, he
c30262	And Saul’s son Jonathan
c30263	came to David in Horesh
c30264	and strengthened his hand in God,
c30265	saying,
c30266	“Do not be afraid,
c30267	for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you.
c30268	And you will be king over Israel,
c30269	and I will be your second-in-command.
c30270	Even my father Saul knows this is true.”
c30271	So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD.
c30272	And David remained in Horesh,
c30273	while Jonathan went home.
c30274	Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah
c30275	and said,
c30276	“Is not David hiding with us in strongholds in Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah,
c30277	south of Jeshimon?
c30278	Now,
c30279	whenever your soul desires,
c30280	O king,
c30281	and we will be responsible
c30282	come down
c30284	for delivering him into your hands.”
c30285	replied Saul,
c30286	“May you be blessed by the LORD,”
c30287	“for you have had compassion on me.
c30288	Please go
c30289	and prepare further.
c30290	Investigate
c30291	and watch
c30292	carefully where he goes
c30293	and who has seen him there,
c30294	for I am told that
c30295	he is extremely cunning.
c30296	Observe
c30297	and find out all the places
c30298	where he hides.
c30299	Then come back to me with certainty,
c30300	and I will go with you.
c30302	If he is in the land,
c30303	I will search him out among all the clans of Judah.”
c30304	So they set out
c30305	and went to Ziph ahead of Saul.
c30306	Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon,
c30307	and Saul and his men went
c30308	to seek [him].
c30309	When David was told about it,
c30310	he went down to the rock
c30311	and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon.
c30312	And when Saul heard of this,
c30313	he pursued David there.
c30314	Saul was proceeding along one side of the mountain,
c30315	and David and his men along the other side.
c30316	Even though David was hurrying
c30317	to get away,
c30318	Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men
c30319	to capture them.
c30320	Then a messenger came to Saul,
c30321	saying,
c30322	quickly,
c30323	“Come
c30324	for the Philistines have raided the land!”
c30325	So Saul broke off
c30326	his pursuit of David
c30327	and went
c30328	to meet the Philistines.
c30329	That is why that place is called the Rock of Escape.
c30330	And David went up from there
c30331	and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi.
c30333	After Saul had returned from pursuing the Philistines,
c30334	he was told,
c30336	“David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.”
c30337	So Saul took three thousand ... men
c30338	chosen ... from all Israel
c30339	and went
c30340	to look for David and his men in the region of the Rocks of the Wild Goats.
c30341	Soon Saul came to the sheepfolds along the road,
c30342	where there was a cave,
c30343	and he went in
c30344	to relieve himself.
c30345	And David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave.
c30346	The men of David said to him,
c30347	“This is the day
c30348	about which the LORD said to you,
c30349	‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hands
c30350	to do with him
c30351	as you wish.’”
c30352	Then David crept up
c30353	and cut off a corner ... robe.
c30354	of Saul's
c30355	secretly
c30356	Afterward,
c30357	David’s conscience was stricken
c30358	because he had cut off the corner
c30359	of Saul’s robe.
c30360	So he said to his men,
c30361	“The LORD forbid
c30362	that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD’s anointed.
c30363	I will never lift my hand against him,
c30364	since he is the LORD’s anointed.”
c30365	With these words David restrained his men,
c30366	and he did not let
c30367	them rise up against Saul.
c30368	Then Saul left the cave
c30369	and went on his way.
c30370	After that, David got up,
c30371	went out of the cave,
c30372	and called out to Saul,
c30374	“My lord the king!”
c30375	When Saul looked behind him,
c30376	David bowed
c30377	facedown
c30378	in reverence
c30379	and said to Saul,
c30380	“Why do you listen to the words of men
c30381	who say,
c30382	‘Look, David intends to harm you’?
c30383	Behold, this day you have seen with your own eyes
c30384	that the LORD delivered you into my hand in the cave.
c30385	I was told
c30386	to kill you,
c30387	but I spared you
c30388	and said,
c30389	‘I will not lift my hand against my lord,
c30390	since he is the LORD’s anointed.’
c30392	my father,
c30393	See,
c30394	look at the corner of your robe in my hand.
c30395	For
c30396	I cut it off,
c30397	but I did not kill you.
c30398	and know
c30399	See
c30400	that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands.
c30401	I have not sinned against you,
c30402	even though you are hunting me down ... my life.
c30403	to take
c30404	May the LORD judge between you and me,
c30405	and may the LORD take vengeance on you,
c30406	but my hand will never be against you.
c30407	As the old proverb says,
c30408	‘Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.’
c30409	But my hand will never be against you.
c30410	Against whom has the king of Israel come out?
c30411	Whom are you pursuing?
c30412	A dead dog? A flea?
c30413	May the LORD be our judge
c30414	and decide between you and me.
c30415	May He take notice
c30416	and plead my case
c30417	and deliver me from your hand.”
c30419	When David had finished
c30420	saying these things,
c30421	Saul called back,
c30422	“Is that your voice,
c30423	David my son?”
c30424	Then Saul ... aloud
c30425	wept
c30426	and said to David,
c30427	“You are more righteous than I,
c30428	for you have rewarded me with good,
c30429	though I have rewarded you with evil.
c30430	And you have shown this day
c30431	how well you have dealt with me;
c30432	for when the LORD delivered me into your hand,
c30433	you did not kill me.
c30434	When a man finds his enemy,
c30435	does he let him go away unharmed?
c30436	May the LORD reward you with good for ... this day.
c30437	what you have done for me
c30438	Now
c30439	I know for sure that
c30440	you will be king,
c30441	and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.
c30442	So now,
c30443	swear to me by the LORD
c30444	that you will not cut off my descendants
c30445	or wipe out my name from my father's house.”
c30446	So David gave his oath to Saul.
c30447	Then Saul returned home,
c30448	but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
c30449	When Samuel died,
c30450	all Israel gathered
c30451	to mourn for him;
c30452	and they buried him at his home in Ramah.
c30453	Then David set out
c30454	and went down to the Wilderness of Paran.
c30455	Now [there was] a man in Maon
c30456	whose business was in Carmel;
c30457	he was a very wealthy man
c30458	with a thousand goats and three thousand sheep,
c30459	which he was
c30460	shearing in Carmel.
c30461	His name was Nabal,
c30462	and his wife’s name [was] Abigail.
c30463	She was an intelligent and beautiful woman,
c30464	but her husband, ... was harsh and evil in his dealings.
c30465	a Calebite,
c30466	While David was in the wilderness, he heard
c30467	that Nabal was shearing sheep.
c30468	So David sent ten young men
c30469	and instructed them,
c30470	“Go up ... at Carmel.
c30471	to Nabal
c30472	Greet him in my name
c30473	and say to him,
c30474	‘Long life to you,
c30475	and peace to you
c30476	and your house
c30477	and to all
c30478	that belongs to you.
c30480	Now
c30481	I hear
c30482	that it is time for shearing.
c30483	When your shepherds
c30485	were with us,
c30486	we did not harass them,
c30487	and nothing of theirs was missing the whole time
c30488	they were in Carmel.
c30489	Ask your young men,
c30490	and they will tell you.
c30491	So let my young men find favor with you,
c30492	for we have come on the day of a feast.
c30493	Please give
c30494	whatever you can afford
c30495	to your servants and to your son David.’”
c30496	When David's young men arrived,
c30497	they relayed all these words to Nabal on behalf of David.
c30498	Then they waited.
c30499	But Nabal ... them,
c30500	asked
c30501	“Who is David?
c30502	Who [is] this son of Jesse?
c30503	Many servants these days
c30504	are breaking away
c30505	from their masters.
c30506	Why should I take my bread and water and the meat
c30507	I have slaughtered for my shearers,
c30508	and give them to these men
c30509	I do not know?”
c30510	whose origin
c30511	So David's men turned around
c30512	and went back,
c30514	and they relayed to him all these words.
c30515	And David said to his men,
c30516	put on
c30517	“Each of you, ... your swords!”
c30518	put on
c30519	all his men ... their swords,
c30520	So David and
c30521	and about four hundred men followed David,
c30522	while two hundred stayed with the supplies.
c30523	Meanwhile, one of Nabal’s young men informed Nabal’s wife Abigail,
c30525	“Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness
c30526	to greet our master,
c30527	but he scolded them.
c30528	Yet these men were very good to us.
c30529	we were not harassed,
c30530	and nothing of ours went missing the whole time
c30531	we lived among them.
c30532	When we were in the field,
c30533	They were a wall around us, both day and night, the whole time
c30534	we were ... near them.
c30535	herding our sheep
c30536	Now
c30537	consider carefully
c30539	what you must do,
c30540	because disaster looms over our master and all his household.
c30541	For he [is such] a scoundrel
c30542	that nobody can speak to him!”
c30543	Abigail hurried
c30544	and took two hundred [loaves] of bread, two skins of wine, five butchered sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs.
c30545	She loaded them on donkeys
c30546	and said to her young men,
c30547	“Go ahead of me.
c30548	I will be right behind you.”
c30549	But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
c30550	As [Abigail] came riding her donkey
c30551	into a mountain ravine,
c30552	she saw
c30553	David and his men coming down
c30554	toward her,
c30555	and she met them.
c30556	Now David ... finished saying,
c30557	had just ... “In vain I have protected all
c30558	that belonged to this man
c30559	in the wilderness
c30560	so that nothing was missed of all
c30561	that [belongs] to him,
c30563	yet he has paid me back evil for good.
c30564	May God punish David,
c30565	and ever so severely,
c30566	if {I let} one ... survive
c30568	until morning.”
c30569	of his men
c30570	When Abigail saw David,
c30571	she quickly
c30572	got off the donkey,
c30573	fell facedown, ... before him.
c30574	and bowed
c30575	She fell at his feet
c30576	and said,
c30577	on me alone,
c30578	“My lord,
c30579	may the blame be
c30580	but please let your servant speak to you;
c30581	hear the words of your servant.
c30582	My lord should pay no attention to this worthless man Nabal,
c30583	for he lives up to his name:
c30584	His name means Fool,
c30585	and folly accompanies him.
c30586	I, your servant, did not see my lord’s young men
c30587	whom you sent.
c30588	Now,
c30589	my lord,
c30590	as surely as the LORD lives
c30591	and you yourself live,
c30592	the LORD has held you back
c30593	from coming to bloodshed
c30594	and avenging yourself with your own hand.
c30596	May your enemies ... be like Nabal.
c30597	and those who seek harm for my lord
c30598	Now
c30599	{let} this gift
c30600	your servant has brought to my lord
c30601	be given to the young men
c30602	who follow [you].
c30603	Please forgive your servant’s offense,
c30604	for the LORD will surely make a lasting dynasty for my lord,
c30605	because he fights the LORD’s battles.
c30606	May no evil be found in you as long as you live.
c30607	And should someone
c30608	pursue you
c30609	and seek your life,
c30610	then the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God.
c30611	But ... the lives of your enemies
c30612	He shall fling away ... [like stones] from a sling.
c30614	When the LORD has done for my lord all
c30615	He promised
c30616	the good ... over
c30617	and has appointed you ruler ... Israel,
c30618	then my lord will have no remorse or guilt of conscience
c30619	over needless bloodshed
c30620	[and] revenge.
c30621	And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord,
c30622	may you remember your maidservant.”
c30623	Then David said to Abigail,
c30624	“Blessed [be] the LORD, the God of Israel,
c30625	who sent you ... this day!
c30626	to meet me
c30627	Blessed [is] your discernment,
c30628	and blessed [are] you,
c30629	because today you kept me
c30630	from bloodshed
c30631	and from avenging myself by my own hand.
c30632	Otherwise,
c30633	as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives,
c30634	who has restrained me
c30635	from harming you,
c30636	if you had not ... quickly
c30637	come
c30638	to meet me,
c30639	then surely no ... belonging to Nabal would have been left alive
c30640	by morning light.”
c30641	male
c30642	Then David accepted from her hand
c30643	what she had brought him,
c30644	and he said to her,
c30645	“Go home in peace.
c30646	See,
c30647	I have heeded your voice
c30648	and granted your request.”
c30649	When Abigail returned to Nabal,
c30650	there
c30651	he was in the house, holding a feast fit for a king,
c30652	in high spirits
c30653	and very drunk.
c30654	So she told him nothing
c30655	until morning light.
c30656	In the morning
c30657	when Nabal was sober,
c30658	his wife told him about these events,
c30659	and his heart failed within him
c30660	and he became [like] a stone.
c30661	About ten days later,
c30662	the LORD struck Nabal
c30663	dead.
c30664	On hearing ... David
c30665	that Nabal was dead,
c30666	said,
c30667	“Blessed [be] the LORD
c30668	who has upheld my cause against the reproach of Nabal
c30669	and has restrained His servant from evil.
c30670	For the LORD has brought the wickedness of Nabal down upon his own head.”
c30671	Then David sent
c30672	word to Abigail,
c30673	asking for her in marriage.
c30674	When [his] servants came to Abigail at Carmel,
c30675	they said,
c30677	“David has sent us
c30678	to take you as his wife.”
c30679	She arose,
c30680	then bowed
c30681	facedown
c30682	and said,
c30683	“Here is your maidservant, ready to serve
c30684	and to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.”
c30685	hurried
c30686	So Abigail
c30687	and got on a donkey,
c30688	[by] five of her maidens,
c30689	and attended
c30690	she followed David’s messengers
c30691	and became his wife.
c30692	David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel.
c30693	So [she and Abigail] were both his wives.
c30694	But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish,
c30695	who [was] from Gallim.
c30696	Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah
c30697	and said,
c30698	“Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, opposite Jeshimon?”
c30699	So Saul,
c30700	went down to the Wilderness of Ziph
c30701	accompanied by three thousand choice men of Israel,
c30702	to search for David there.
c30703	Saul camped ... at the hill of Hachilah
c30704	beside the road ... opposite Jeshimon,
c30705	but David was living in the wilderness.
c30706	When he realized
c30707	that Saul had followed him there,
c30708	David sent out spies
c30709	to verify
c30710	that Saul had arrived.
c30711	Then David set out
c30712	and went to the place
c30713	where Saul had camped.
c30714	He saw the place
c30715	where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general of his army, had lain down.
c30716	Saul was lying inside the inner circle of the camp,
c30717	with the troops camped around him.
c30718	And David asked
c30719	Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, ... into ... to ... answered
c30721	“Who will go down with me ... the camp ... Saul?”
c30722	Abishai.
c30723	“I will go with you,”
c30724	That night David and Abishai came to the troops,
c30725	and Saul was lying there
c30726	asleep
c30727	in the inner circle of the camp,
c30728	with his spear stuck in the ground by his head.
c30729	And Abner and the troops were lying around him.
c30730	Abishai said to David,
c30731	“Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand.
c30732	Now, therefore,
c30733	please let me thrust the spear through him into the ground with one stroke.
c30734	I will not need to strike him twice!”
c30735	But David said to Abishai,
c30736	“Do not destroy him,
c30737	for who can lift a hand against the LORD’s anointed
c30738	and be guiltless?”
c30739	David added,
c30740	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c30741	the LORD Himself will strike him down;
c30742	either his day will come
c30743	and he will die,
c30744	or he will go into battle
c30745	and perish.
c30746	But the LORD forbid that I
c30747	should stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed.
c30748	Instead,
c30749	take the spear
c30750	by his head,
c30751	and water jug
c30752	and let us go.”
c30753	So David took the spear and water jug by Saul’s head,
c30754	and they departed.
c30755	No one saw them
c30756	[or] knew about it,
c30757	nor did anyone wake up;
c30758	they all remained asleep,
c30759	because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them.
c30760	Then David crossed to the other side
c30761	and stood atop the mountain at a distance—
c30762	there was a wide gulf between them.
c30763	And David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner,
c30765	“Aren’t you going to answer me,
c30766	Abner?”
c30767	Abner replied.
c30769	“Who
c30770	calls to the king?”
c30771	So David said to Abner,
c30772	“You are a man, aren’t you?
c30773	And who in Israel is your equal?
c30774	Why then did you not protect your lord the king
c30775	when one of the people came
c30776	to destroy him?
c30777	This thing ... is not good.
c30778	you have done
c30779	As surely as the LORD lives,
c30780	all of you deserve to die, since you
c30781	did not protect your lord, the LORD’s anointed. ... that
c30782	Now look around.
c30783	Where are the king’s spear and water jug
c30784	were by his head?”
c30785	Then Saul recognized David’s voice
c30786	and asked,
c30787	“Is that your voice,
c30788	David my son?”
c30789	David said.
c30790	“It is my voice,
c30791	my lord and king,”
c30792	And he continued,
c30793	“Why is my lord pursuing his servant?
c30794	What have I done?
c30795	What evil is in my hand?
c30796	Now
c30797	please, may my lord the king hear the words of his servant:
c30798	If the LORD has stirred you up against me,
c30799	then may He accept an offering.
c30800	But if men [have done it],
c30801	may they be cursed in the presence of the LORD!
c30802	For today they have driven me away
c30803	from sharing in the inheritance of the LORD,
c30804	saying,
c30805	‘Go,
c30806	serve other gods.’
c30807	So
c30808	do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the LORD.
c30809	For the king of Israel has come out
c30810	to look for a flea,
c30811	like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.”
c30812	Then Saul replied,
c30813	“I have sinned.
c30814	Come back,
c30815	David, my son.
c30816	I will never harm you again,
c30817	because today you considered my life precious.
c30818	I have played the fool!
c30819	I have committed a grave error.”
c30820	David answered.
c30822	“Here is the king’s spear,”
c30823	“Let one of the young men come over
c30824	and get it.
c30825	May the LORD repay every man for his righteousness and faithfulness.
c30826	For the LORD delivered you into [my] hand today,
c30827	but I would not
c30828	stretch out my hand against the LORD's anointed.
c30829	As surely as
c30830	I valued your life today,
c30831	so may the LORD value my life
c30832	and rescue me from all trouble.”
c30833	Saul said to him,
c30834	“[May] you [be] blessed,
c30835	my son David.
c30836	You will accomplish great things
c30837	and will surely prevail.”
c30838	So David went on his way,
c30839	and Saul returned home.
c30840	David, however, said to himself,
c30841	“One of these days now I will be swept away by the hand of Saul.
c30842	There is nothing better for me
c30843	than to escape to the land of the Philistines.
c30844	Then Saul will stop ... for me
c30845	searching ... all over Israel,
c30846	and I will slip out of his hand.”
c30847	So David set out
c30848	his six hundred men and went
c30849	with
c30850	to Achish son of Maoch, the king of Gath.
c30851	David and his men settled in Gath with Achish, and each man had his family with him. David had his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.
c30852	And when Saul learned
c30853	that David had fled to Gath,
c30854	he no longer
c30855	searched for him.
c30856	Then David said to Achish,
c30857	“If I have found favor in your eyes,
c30858	let me be assigned a place in one of the outlying towns,
c30859	so I can live there.
c30860	For why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”
c30861	That day Achish gave him Ziklag,
c30862	and to this day [it] still belongs to the kings of Judah.
c30863	And the time ... amounted to
c30864	that David lived in Philistine territory
c30865	a year and four months.
c30866	Now David and his men went up
c30867	and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites.
c30868	(From ... these people had inhabited the land
c30869	ancient times
c30870	extending to Shur and Egypt.)
c30871	Whenever David attacked a territory,
c30872	he did not leave a man or woman {alive},
c30873	but he took the flocks and herds, the donkeys, camels, and clothing.
c30874	Then he would return
c30875	to Achish,
c30876	who would ask him,
c30877	“What have you raided today?”
c30878	And David would reply,
c30879	“The Negev of Judah,” or “The Negev of Jerahmeel,” or “The Negev of the Kenites.”
c30880	David did not {leave} a man or woman alive
c30881	to be brought to Gath,
c30882	for he said,
c30883	“Otherwise they will report us,
c30884	saying,
c30885	‘This is what David did.’”
c30886	And this was David’s custom the whole time
c30887	he lived in Philistine territory.
c30888	So Achish trusted David,
c30889	thinking,
c30890	“Since he has made himself repugnant to his people Israel,
c30891	he will be my servant forever.”
c30892	Now in those days
c30893	the Philistines gathered their forces for war,
c30894	to fight against Israel.
c30895	So Achish said to David,
c30896	“You must understand
c30897	that you and your men will accompany me in the army.”
c30898	David replied,
c30899	“Then you will come to know
c30900	what your servant can do.”
c30901	said Achish.
c30902	“Very well,” ... “I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
c30903	Now by this time Samuel had died,
c30904	and all Israel had mourned for him
c30905	and buried him in Ramah, his own city.
c30906	And Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land.
c30907	The Philistines came together
c30909	and camped at Shunem,
c30910	while Saul gathered all Israel
c30911	and camped at Gilboa.
c30912	When Saul saw the Philistine army,
c30913	was afraid
c30914	he ... and trembled violently.
c30915	He inquired of the LORD,
c30916	but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets.
c30917	Then Saul said to his servants,
c30918	“Find me a woman who is a medium,
c30919	so I can go
c30920	and consult her.”
c30921	his servants replied.
c30922	“There [is] a medium at Endor,”
c30923	So Saul disguised himself
c30924	by putting on different clothes,
c30925	and he set out with two of his men.
c30926	They came to the woman at night,
c30927	and Saul said,
c30928	“Consult a spirit for me.
c30929	Bring up for me
c30930	the one I name.”
c30931	But the woman replied,
c30932	“Surely
c30933	you know
c30934	what Saul has done,
c30935	how he has killed the mediums and spiritists in the land.
c30936	Why have you set a trap
c30937	to get me killed?”
c30938	Then Saul swore to her by the LORD:
c30940	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c30941	no punishment shall come upon you for this.”
c30942	the woman asked.
c30943	“Whom shall I bring up for you?”
c30944	he replied.
c30945	“Bring up Samuel,”
c30946	But when the woman saw Samuel,
c30947	she cried out in a loud voice
c30948	[and] said to Saul,
c30950	“Why have you deceived me?
c30951	You are Saul!”
c30952	the king replied.
c30953	“Do not be afraid,”
c30954	“What do you see?”
c30955	the woman answered.
c30956	“I see a god
c30957	coming up out of the earth,”
c30958	asked Saul.
c30959	“What does he look like?”
c30960	she replied.
c30961	“An old man is coming up,”
c30962	“And he is wearing a robe.”
c30963	So Saul knew
c30964	that it was Samuel,
c30965	and he bowed
c30966	facedown
c30967	in reverence.
c30968	Then Samuel said to Saul,
c30969	“Why have you disturbed
c30970	me by bringing me up?”
c30971	replied Saul.
c30972	“I am deeply distressed,”
c30973	“The Philistines are fighting against me,
c30974	and God has turned away from me.
c30975	He no longer answers me, either by the prophets or dreams.
c30976	So I have called on you
c30977	to tell
c30978	me what to do.”
c30979	asked Samuel,
c30980	“Why do you consult me,”
c30981	“since the LORD has turned away from you
c30982	and become your enemy?
c30983	[He] has done
c30984	exactly what He spoke through me:
c30985	The LORD has torn the kingship out of your hand
c30986	and given it to your neighbor David.
c30987	Because you did not obey the LORD
c30988	[or] carry out His burning anger against Amalek,
c30989	the LORD has done this to you today.
c30990	Moreover, the LORD will deliver Israel with you into the hands of the Philistines,
c30991	and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me.
c30992	And the LORD will deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.”
c30993	Immediately Saul
c30994	fell flat on the ground,
c30995	terrified by the words of Samuel.
c30996	And his strength was gone,
c30997	because he had not eaten anything all that day and night.
c30998	When the woman came to Saul
c30999	and saw
c31000	how distraught he was,
c31001	she said to him,
c31002	“Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice.
c31003	I took my life in my hands
c31004	and did
c31005	as you told me.
c31006	Now
c31007	please listen to your servant
c31008	and let me set a morsel of bread before you.
c31009	Eat,
c31010	and it will give you strength
c31011	to go on your way.”
c31012	Saul refused,
c31013	saying,
c31014	“I will not eat.”
c31015	But his servants joined the woman in urging him,
c31016	and he heeded their voice.
c31017	He got up from the ground
c31018	and sat on the bed.
c31019	The woman had a fattened calf at her house,
c31020	and she quickly
c31021	slaughtered it.
c31022	She also took flour,
c31023	kneaded it,
c31024	and baked unleavened bread.
c31025	She served it to Saul and his servants,
c31026	and they ate.
c31027	they got up
c31028	And that night ... and left.
c31029	Now the Philistines brought all their forces together at Aphek,
c31030	while Israel camped by the spring
c31031	in Jezreel.
c31032	As the Philistine leaders marched out their units of hundreds and thousands,
c31033	David and his men marched behind them with Achish.
c31034	The commanders of the Philistines asked,
c31035	“What [about] these Hebrews?”
c31036	Achish replied,
c31037	“Is this not David, the servant of King Saul of Israel?
c31038	He has been with me all these days, even years,
c31039	and from the day ... I have found no fault in him.”
c31040	he defected
c31041	until today
c31042	But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with Achish
c31043	and told him,
c31044	“Send that man back
c31045	and let him return to the place
c31046	you assigned him.
c31047	He must not go down with us into battle
c31048	only to become our adversary during the war.
c31049	What better way for him to regain the favor of his master
c31050	than with the heads of our men?
c31051	Is this not the David
c31052	about whom they sing in their dances:
c31054	‘Saul has slain [his] thousands,
c31055	and David his tens of thousands’?”
c31056	So Achish summoned David
c31057	and told him,
c31058	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c31059	you have been upright ... because
c31060	in my sight, and it seems right
c31061	that you should march in and out
c31062	with me in the army,
c31063	I have found no fault in you from the day
c31064	you came to me
c31065	until this day.
c31066	But you have no favor in the sight of the leaders.
c31067	Therefore now
c31068	turn back
c31069	and go in peace,
c31070	and you will not be doing anything to displease the leaders of the Philistines.”
c31071	David replied.
c31072	“But what have I done?”
c31073	“What have you found against your servant, from the day
c31074	I came to you
c31075	until today,
c31076	to keep me from going along
c31077	to fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”
c31078	Achish replied,
c31080	“I know
c31081	that you [are] as pleasing in my sight as an angel of God.
c31082	But the commanders of the Philistines have said,
c31083	‘He must not go into battle with us.’
c31084	Now then,
c31085	get up early in the morning,
c31086	along with your masters’ servants
c31087	who came with you,
c31088	as soon as
c31089	it is light.”
c31090	and go
c31091	So David and his men got up early
c31093	in the morning
c31094	to return to the land of the Philistines.
c31095	And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
c31097	On the third day David and his men arrived in Ziklag,
c31098	and the Amalekites had raided the Negev,
c31099	attacked Ziklag,
c31100	and burned it down.
c31101	They had taken captive the women
c31102	and all who were there,
c31103	both young and old.
c31104	They had not killed anyone,
c31105	but had carried them off
c31106	as they went on their way.
c31107	When David and his men came to the city,
c31108	they found it burned down
c31109	and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
c31110	So David and the troops ... lifted up
c31111	with him
c31112	their voices
c31113	and wept
c31114	until they had no strength
c31115	left to weep.
c31116	David’s two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel, had been taken captive.
c31117	And David was greatly distressed
c31118	because the people spoke
c31119	of stoning him,
c31120	because the soul ... grieved
c31121	of every man ... for his sons and daughters.
c31122	But David found strength in the LORD his God.
c31123	Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech,
c31124	“Bring me the ephod.”
c31125	So Abiathar brought it to him,
c31126	and David inquired of the LORD:
c31127	the LORD replied,
c31128	“Should I pursue these raiders?
c31129	Will I overtake them?”
c31131	“Pursue
c31132	them,” ... “for you will surely overtake them
c31133	and rescue the captives.”
c31134	So David and his six hundred men went
c31136	to the Brook of Besor,
c31137	where some stayed behind
c31138	But David and four hundred men continued in pursuit.
c31139	two hundred men
c31140	because ... were too exhausted
c31141	to cross the brook.
c31142	Now [his men] found an Egyptian in the field
c31143	and brought him to David.
c31144	They gave [the man] ... and food
c31145	to eat—
c31146	water to drink
c31147	a piece of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins.
c31148	So he ate
c31149	and was revived,
c31150	for he had not had any food
c31151	[or] water for three days and three nights.
c31152	Then David asked him,
c31153	“To whom do you [belong],
c31154	and where are you from?”
c31155	he replied,
c31156	“I am an Egyptian,”
c31157	“the slave of an Amalekite.
c31158	My master abandoned me
c31159	three days ago when I fell ill.
c31160	We raided the Negev of the Cherethites,
c31161	the territory of Judah,
c31162	and the Negev of Caleb,
c31163	and we burned down Ziklag.”
c31164	me to ... David asked.
c31165	“Will you lead ... these raiders?” ... you to them.”
c31166	And [the man] replied,
c31167	“Swear to me by God
c31168	that you will not kill me
c31169	[or] deliver me into the hands of my master,
c31170	and I will lead
c31171	So he led [David] down,
c31172	and there were the Amalekites spread out over all the land,
c31173	eating,
c31174	drinking,
c31175	and celebrating the great amount of plunder
c31176	they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah.
c31177	And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day.
c31178	Not a man escaped,
c31179	except four hundred young men
c31180	who ... riding off on camels.
c31181	fled,
c31182	So David recovered everything
c31183	the Amalekites had taken,
c31184	[including] his two wives.
c31185	Nothing was missing, young or old, son or daughter, or any of the plunder
c31186	the Amalekites had taken.
c31187	David brought everything back.
c31188	And he recovered all the flocks and herds,
c31189	which his men drove ahead of the other livestock,
c31190	calling out,
c31191	“This is David’s plunder!”
c31192	When David came to the two hundred men
c31193	who had been too exhausted
c31194	to follow him
c31195	from the Brook of Besor,
c31196	they came out
c31197	to meet him
c31198	[and] the troops
c31199	with him.
c31200	As David approached the men,
c31201	he greeted them,
c31202	but all the wicked and worthless men ... said, ... for each
c31203	among those who had gone with David
c31205	“Because they did not go with us,
c31206	we will not share with them the plunder
c31207	we recovered,
c31208	except ... man’s wife and children.
c31209	They may take
c31210	them and go.”
c31211	But David said,
c31212	you must not do this
c31213	“My brothers,
c31214	with what the LORD has given us.
c31215	He has protected us
c31216	and delivered ... the raiders
c31217	who came against us.
c31218	into our hands
c31219	Who will listen to your proposal?
c31220	The share
c31221	of the one who went to battle
c31222	{will match} the share
c31223	of the one who stayed with the supplies.
c31224	They will share alike.”
c31225	And so it has been from that day forward.
c31226	David established this statute as an ordinance for Israel to this very day.
c31227	When David arrived in Ziklag,
c31228	he sent some of the plunder to his friends, the elders of Judah,
c31229	saying,
c31230	“Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the LORD’s enemies.”
c31231	He sent gifts to those in Bethel,
c31232	Ramoth Negev,
c31233	and Jattir;
c31234	to those in Aroer,
c31235	Siphmoth,
c31236	and Eshtemoa;
c31237	to those in Racal
c31238	and in the cities of the Jerahmeelites
c31239	and Kenites;
c31240	to those in Hormah,
c31241	Bor-ashan,
c31242	and Athach;
c31243	to those in Hebron,
c31244	and to those in all the places
c31245	where David and his men had roamed.
c31246	Now the Philistines fought against Israel,
c31247	and the men of Israel fled before them,
c31248	and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
c31249	The Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons,
c31250	and they killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua.
c31251	When the battle intensified against Saul,
c31252	the archers overtook him
c31253	and wounded him critically.
c31254	Then Saul said to his armor-bearer,
c31255	“Draw your sword
c31256	and run it through me,
c31257	or these uncircumcised men will come
c31258	and run me through
c31259	and torture me!”
c31260	But the armor-bearer refused,
c31261	because he was terrified.
c31262	So Saul took his own sword
c31263	and fell on it.
c31264	When his armor-bearer saw
c31265	that Saul was dead,
c31266	he too fell on his own sword
c31267	and died with him.
c31268	So on that day, Saul died together with his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men.
c31269	When the Israelites ... saw
c31270	along the valley
c31271	and those on the other side of the Jordan
c31272	that the army of Israel had fled
c31273	and that Saul and his sons had died,
c31274	they abandoned their cities
c31275	and ran away.
c31276	So the Philistines came
c31277	and occupied them.
c31278	The next day,
c31279	when the Philistines came
c31280	to strip the dead,
c31281	they found Saul and his three sons
c31282	fallen on Mount Gilboa.
c31283	They cut off Saul’s head,
c31284	stripped off his armor,
c31285	and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines
c31286	to proclaim the news in the temples of their idols and among their people.
c31287	They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths
c31288	and hung his body on the wall of Beth-shan.
c31289	When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard
c31290	what the Philistines had done to Saul,
c31291	all their valiant warriors set out,
c31292	journeyed all night,
c31293	and retrieved the bodies of Saul [and] his sons from the wall of Beth-shan.
c31294	When they arrived at Jabesh,
c31295	they burned the bodies there.
c31296	Then they took their bones
c31297	and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh,
c31298	and they fasted seven days.
c31299	After the death of Saul,
c31300	David returned
c31301	from the slaughter of the Amalekites
c31302	and stayed in Ziklag two days.
c31303	On the third day
c31304	a man ... arrived from Saul’s camp.
c31305	with torn clothes
c31306	and dust on his head
c31308	When he came to David,
c31309	he fell to the ground
c31310	to pay him homage.
c31311	David asked.
c31312	“Where have you come from?”
c31313	he replied.
c31314	“I have escaped from the Israelite camp,”
c31315	David asked.
c31316	“What was the outcome?”
c31317	“Please tell me.”
c31318	he replied.
c31319	“The troops fled from the battle,”
c31320	“Many of [them] fell
c31321	and died.
c31322	And Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.”
c31323	David asked the young man
c31324	who had brought him the report,
c31325	“How do you know
c31326	Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
c31327	he replied,
c31329	“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,”
c31330	“and there was Saul, leaning on his spear,
c31331	with the chariots and the cavalry closing in on him.
c31332	When he turned around
c31333	and saw me,
c31334	he called out
c31335	and I answered,
c31336	‘Here I am!’
c31337	he asked.
c31338	‘Who are you?’
c31339	So I told him,
c31340	‘I am an Amalekite.’
c31341	Then he begged me,
c31342	‘Stand over
c31343	me and kill me,
c31344	for agony has seized me
c31345	but my life still lingers.’
c31346	So I stood over
c31347	him and killed him,
c31348	because I knew
c31349	that ... he could not survive.
c31350	after he had fallen
c31351	And I took the crown
c31352	that was on his head
c31353	and the band
c31354	that was on his arm,
c31355	and I have brought them here to my lord.”
c31356	Then David took hold of his clothes
c31357	and tore them,
c31358	and all the men ... did the same.
c31359	who [were] with him
c31360	They mourned
c31361	and wept
c31362	and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the people of the LORD and the house of Israel,
c31363	because they had fallen by the sword.
c31364	And David inquired of the young man
c31365	who had brought him the report,
c31366	“Where are you from?”
c31367	he answered.
c31368	“I am the son of a foreigner,” ... “I am an Amalekite.”
c31369	So David asked him,
c31370	“Why were you not afraid
c31371	to lift your hand
c31372	to destroy the LORD’s anointed?”
c31373	Then David summoned one of the young men
c31374	and said,
c31375	“Go,
c31376	execute him!”
c31377	So he struck him down,
c31378	and he died.
c31379	For David had said to the Amalekite,
c31380	“Your blood [be] on your own head
c31381	because your own mouth testified against you,
c31382	saying,
c31383	‘I killed the LORD’s anointed.’”
c31384	Then David took up this lament for Saul and his son Jonathan,
c31385	and he ordered
c31386	that the sons of Judah be taught [the Song of] the Bow.
c31387	It is written in the Book of Jashar:
c31388	“Your glory,
c31389	O Israel,
c31390	lies slain on your heights.
c31391	How the mighty have fallen!
c31392	Tell [it] not in Gath;
c31393	proclaim [it] not in the streets of Ashkelon,
c31394	lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
c31395	and the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
c31396	O mountains of Gilboa,
c31397	no dew
c31398	may you have ... or rain,
c31399	no fields [yielding] offerings [of grain].
c31400	For there the shield of the mighty was defiled,
c31401	the shield of Saul, no longer anointed with oil.
c31402	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not retreat,
c31403	and the sword of Saul did not return empty.
c31404	Saul and Jonathan, beloved and delightful
c31405	in life, were not divided in death.
c31406	They were swifter than eagles,
c31407	they were stronger than lions.
c31408	O daughters of Israel,
c31409	weep for Saul,
c31410	who clothed you in scarlet and luxury,
c31411	who decked your garments with ornaments of gold.
c31412	How the mighty have fallen in the thick of battle!
c31413	Jonathan lies slain on your heights.
c31414	I grieve for you,
c31415	Jonathan, my brother.
c31416	You were delightful to me;
c31417	your love to me was extraordinary, surpassing the love of women.
c31418	How the mighty have fallen
c31419	and the weapons of war have perished!”
c31420	Some time later,
c31421	David inquired of the LORD,
c31423	“Should I go up to one of the towns of Judah?”
c31424	the LORD answered.
c31425	“Go up,”
c31426	Then David asked,
c31427	“Where should I go?”
c31428	replied the LORD.
c31429	“To Hebron,”
c31430	So David went there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
c31431	the men
c31432	who were with him,
c31433	David also took
c31434	each with his household,
c31435	and they settled in the towns near Hebron.
c31436	Then the men of Judah came [to Hebron],
c31437	and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.
c31438	And they told David,
c31440	“It was the men of Jabesh-gilead
c31441	who buried Saul.”
c31442	So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead
c31443	to tell them,
c31444	“The LORD bless you,
c31445	because you have shown this kindness to Saul your lord
c31446	when you buried him.
c31447	Now
c31448	may the LORD show you loving devotion and truth,
c31449	and I will also show you the same favor
c31450	because you have done this.
c31451	Now then,
c31452	be strong
c31453	and courageous,
c31454	for though Saul your lord is dead,
c31455	the house of Judah has anointed me as their king.”
c31456	Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander ... army,
c31457	of Saul’s
c31458	took Saul’s son Ish-bosheth,
c31459	moved him to Mahanaim,
c31460	and made him king over Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin— over all Israel.
c31461	Saul’s son Ish-bosheth was forty years old
c31462	when he began to reign over Israel,
c31463	and he reigned for two years.
c31464	The house of Judah, however, followed David.
c31465	And the length of time ... was
c31466	that David ... king in Hebron over the house of Judah
c31467	was seven years and six months.
c31468	One day Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth son of Saul marched out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
c31469	So Joab son of Zeruiah, along with the servants of David, marched out
c31470	and met them by the pool of Gibeon.
c31471	And the two camps took up positions on opposite sides of the pool.
c31473	Then Abner said to Joab,
c31474	“Let us have the young men get up
c31475	and compete before us.”
c31476	Joab replied.
c31477	“Let them get up,”
c31478	So they got up
c31479	and were counted off— twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.
c31480	grabbed
c31481	Then each man ... his opponent by the head
c31482	and thrust his sword into his opponent’s side,
c31483	and they all fell together.
c31484	So this place, ... is called the Field of Swords.
c31485	which is in Gibeon,
c31486	The battle that day was intense,
c31487	and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the servants of David.
c31488	The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.
c31489	Now Asahel [was] fleet of foot like a ... gazelle,
c31490	wild
c31491	and he chased Abner,
c31492	not turning
c31493	to the right or to the left
c31494	in his pursuit.
c31495	And Abner glanced back
c31496	and said,
c31497	“Is that you,
c31498	Asahel?”
c31499	Asahel replied.
c31500	“It is,”
c31501	So Abner told him,
c31502	“Turn to your right or to your left,
c31503	seize one of the young men,
c31504	and take his equipment for yourself.”
c31505	But Asahel would not
c31506	stop chasing him.
c31507	Once again, Abner
c31508	warned Asahel,
c31509	“Stop chasing me.
c31510	Why should I strike you to the ground?
c31511	How could I show my face to your brother Joab?”
c31512	But Asahel refused
c31513	to turn away;
c31514	so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into his stomach,
c31515	and [it] came out his back,
c31516	and he fell ... on the spot.
c31517	dead
c31519	And every man
c31520	when he came to the place
c31521	where Asahel had fallen
c31522	and died.
c31523	paused
c31524	But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner.
c31525	By sunset,
c31526	they had gone as far as the hill of Ammah
c31527	opposite Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
c31528	The Benjamites rallied to Abner,
c31529	formed a single unit,
c31530	and took their stand atop a hill.
c31531	Then Abner called out to Joab:
c31532	before you tell
c31533	“Must the sword devour forever?
c31534	Do you not realize
c31535	that this will only end in bitterness?
c31536	How long ... the troops
c31537	to stop pursuing their brothers?”
c31538	Joab replied,
c31539	“As surely as God lives,”
c31540	“if you had not spoken up,
c31541	the troops would have continued ... until morning.”
c31542	pursuing their brothers
c31543	So Joab blew the trumpet,
c31544	and all the troops stopped;
c31545	they no longer pursued Israel
c31546	or continued
c31547	to fight.
c31548	And all that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah.
c31549	They crossed the Jordan,
c31550	marched all morning,
c31551	and arrived at Mahanaim.
c31552	When Joab returned from pursuing Abner,
c31553	he gathered all the troops.
c31554	In addition to Asahel, nineteen of David’s servants were missing,
c31555	but they had struck down ... men of Benjamin and Abner.
c31556	360
c31557	Later, they took Asahel
c31558	and buried him in his father’s tomb
c31559	in Bethlehem.
c31560	Then Joab and his men marched all night
c31561	and reached Hebron at daybreak.
c31562	The war between the house of Saul and the house of David was protracted.
c31563	And David grew [stronger]
c31564	and stronger,
c31565	while the house of Saul grew [weaker]
c31566	and weaker.
c31567	And sons were born to David in Hebron:
c31568	His firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam of Jezreel;
c31569	his second was Chileab, by Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel;
c31570	his third was Absalom, the son of Maacah the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur;
c31571	his fourth was Adonijah, the son of Haggith;
c31572	his fifth was Shephatiah, the son of Abital;
c31573	and his sixth was Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah.
c31574	These [sons] were born to David in Hebron.
c31575	Now during
c31576	the war between the house of Saul and the house of David,
c31577	Abner had continued to strengthen [his position] in the house of Saul.
c31578	Meanwhile, Saul had a concubine
c31579	named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah.
c31580	So Ish-bosheth questioned Abner,
c31581	“Why did you sleep with my father’s concubine?”
c31582	Abner was furious over Ish-bosheth’s accusation.
c31583	he asked.
c31584	“Am I the head of a dog
c31585	that belongs to Judah?”
c31586	“All this time I have been loyal to the house of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends.
c31587	I have not delivered you into the hand of David,
c31588	but now you accuse me of wrongdoing with this woman!
c31589	May God punish Abner,
c31590	and ever so severely,
c31591	if
c31592	for David as the LORD has sworn to him,
c31593	I do not do
c31594	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul
c31595	and to establish the throne of David over Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.”
c31596	Ish-bosheth did not dare
c31597	to say another word to [him].
c31598	And for fear [of Abner],
c31599	Then Abner sent messengers in his place ... to David,
c31600	to say
c31601	“To whom [does] the land [belong]?
c31603	Make your covenant with me,
c31604	and you can be certain my hand [will be] on your side
c31605	to turn all Israel to you.”
c31606	replied David,
c31607	“Good,”
c31608	“I will make a covenant with you.
c31609	But there is one thing I require of you:
c31611	Do not appear before me
c31612	unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal
c31613	when you come
c31614	to see me.”
c31615	Then David sent messengers ... to Ish-bosheth son of Saul,
c31616	to say
c31617	“Give me back my wife, Michal,
c31618	whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred Philistine foreskins.”
c31619	So Ish-bosheth sent
c31620	and took [Michal] from [her] husband Paltiel son of Laish.
c31621	Her husband followed her, weeping all the way to Bahurim.
c31622	Then Abner said to him,
c31624	“Go back.”
c31625	So he returned [home].
c31626	Now Abner conferred with the elders of Israel
c31627	and said,
c31628	“In the past you sought David as your king.
c31629	Now
c31630	take action,
c31631	because the LORD has said to David,
c31633	‘Through My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hands of the Philistines [and] of all their enemies.’”
c31634	Abner also spoke to the Benjamites
c31635	and went
c31636	to Hebron to tell David all
c31637	that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.
c31638	When Abner ... came to David at Hebron,
c31639	and twenty of his men
c31640	David held ... for them.
c31642	a feast
c31643	Then Abner said to David,
c31645	“Let me go at once,
c31646	and I will gather all Israel to my lord the king,
c31647	that they may make a covenant with you,
c31648	and that you may rule over all
c31649	that your heart desires.”
c31650	So David dismissed Abner,
c31651	and he went in peace.
c31652	Just then David’s soldiers and Joab returned from a raid,
c31653	bringing with them a great plunder.
c31654	But Abner [was]
c31655	not with David in Hebron
c31656	because David had sent him
c31657	on his way in peace.
c31658	When Joab and all his troops
c31660	arrived,
c31661	[he] was informed,
c31663	“Abner son of Ner came to see the king,
c31664	who sent him
c31665	on his way in peace.”
c31666	So Joab went to the king
c31667	and said,
c31668	“What have you done?
c31669	Look, Abner came to you.
c31670	Why did you dismiss him?
c31671	Now he is getting away.
c31672	Surely you realize ... Abner son of Ner
c31673	that
c31674	to deceive you
c31675	came
c31676	and to track your movements
c31677	and all
c31678	that you are doing.”
c31679	As soon as Joab had left David,
c31680	he sent messengers after Abner,
c31681	who brought him back from the well of Sirah;
c31682	but David was unaware of it.
c31683	When Abner returned to Hebron,
c31684	Joab pulled him aside into the gateway,
c31685	as if to speak to him privately,
c31686	and there Joab stabbed him in the stomach.
c31687	So Abner died on account of the blood of Joab’s brother Asahel.
c31688	Afterward, David heard about this
c31689	and said,
c31690	“I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.
c31691	May it whirl over the heads of Joab and the entire house of his father,
c31692	and may the house of Joab never be without one having a discharge or skin disease
c31693	or who leans on a staff
c31694	or falls by the sword
c31695	or starves.”
c31696	(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner
c31697	because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)
c31698	Then David ordered Joab and all the people
c31699	with him,
c31700	“Tear your clothes,
c31701	put on sackcloth,
c31702	and mourn before Abner.”
c31703	And King David himself walked behind the funeral bier.
c31704	When they buried Abner in Hebron,
c31705	the king ... aloud
c31706	wept ... at Abner’s tomb,
c31707	and all the people wept.
c31708	And the king sang this lament for Abner:
c31710	“Should Abner die the death of a fool?
c31711	Your hands were not bound,
c31712	your feet were not fettered.
c31713	As a man falls before the wicked,
c31714	[so also] you fell.”
c31715	And all the people ... even more.
c31716	wept over him
c31717	Then all the people came
c31718	and urged David to eat something while it was still day,
c31719	but David took an oath,
c31720	saying,
c31721	“May God punish me,
c31722	and ever so severely,
c31723	if
c31724	else before the sun sets!”
c31725	I taste bread or anything
c31726	All the people took note
c31727	and were pleased.
c31728	In fact, everything
c31729	the king did
c31730	pleased them
c31731	So on that day all the troops and all Israel were convinced
c31732	that the king had no part
c31733	in the murder of Abner son of Ner.
c31734	Then the king said to his servants,
c31735	“Do you not realize
c31736	that a great prince has fallen today in Israel?
c31737	And I [am] weak this day,
c31738	though anointed as king,
c31739	and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too fierce for me.
c31740	May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil!”
c31741	Now when [Ish-bosheth] son of Saul heard
c31742	that Abner had died in Hebron,
c31743	he lost courage,
c31744	and all Israel was dismayed.
c31745	Saul’s son had two men who were leaders of raiding parties:
c31746	One [was] named Baanah
c31747	and the other Rechab;
c31748	[they were] the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the tribe of Benjamin
c31749	(Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin,
c31750	because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim
c31751	and live there as foreigners to this very day).
c31752	And Jonathan son of Saul had a son [who was] lame in [his] feet.
c31753	He was five years old
c31754	when the report about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel.
c31755	His nurse picked him up
c31756	and fled,
c31758	but as she was hurrying
c31759	to escape,
c31760	he fell
c31761	and became lame.
c31762	His name was Mephibosheth.
c31763	Now Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out
c31764	and arrived
c31765	in the heat of the day,
c31766	at the house of Ish-bosheth
c31767	while the king was taking his midday nap.
c31768	They entered the interior of the house as if to get some wheat,
c31769	and they stabbed him in the stomach.
c31770	Then Rechab and his brother Baanah slipped away.
c31771	They had entered the house
c31772	while Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed,
c31773	and having stabbed
c31774	and killed him,
c31775	they beheaded him,
c31776	took his head,
c31777	and traveled all night by way of the Arabah.
c31778	They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron
c31779	and said to the king,
c31780	“Here is the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy
c31781	who sought your life.
c31782	Today the LORD has granted vengeance to my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.”
c31783	But David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite,
c31785	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c31786	who has redeemed my life from all distress,
c31787	when
c31788	someone told me,
c31790	‘Look, Saul is dead’
c31791	and thought he was a bearer of good news,
c31792	I seized him
c31793	and put him to death at Ziklag.
c31794	That was his reward for [his] news!
c31795	How much more, when wicked men kill a righteous man in his own house [and] on his own bed,
c31796	shall I not now
c31797	require his blood from your hands
c31798	and wipe you off the earth!”
c31799	So David commanded his young men,
c31800	and they killed [Rechab and Baanah].
c31801	They cut off their hands and feet
c31802	and hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron,
c31803	but they took the head of Ish-bosheth
c31804	and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.
c31805	Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron
c31806	and said,
c31808	“Here
c31809	we [are], your own flesh and blood.
c31810	Even in times past,
c31811	while Saul was king over us,
c31812	you were the one
c31813	who led Israel out
c31814	and brought them back. And to you
c31815	the LORD said,
c31816	‘You will shepherd My people Israel,
c31817	and you will be ruler over [them].’”
c31818	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron,
c31819	[where] King David made with them a covenant before the LORD.
c31820	And they anointed [him] king over Israel.
c31821	David was thirty years old
c31822	when he became king,
c31823	[and] he reigned forty years.
c31824	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months,
c31825	and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
c31826	Now the king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who inhabited the land.
c31827	The Jebusites said to David:
c31828	For they thought,
c31829	“You will never get in here.
c31830	Even the blind and lame can repel you.”
c31832	“David cannot get in here.”
c31833	Nevertheless , David captured the fortress of Zion
c31834	(that is, the City of David).
c31835	On that day [he] said,
c31837	“Whoever attacks the Jebusites
c31838	must use the water shaft to reach
c31839	the lame and blind who are despised by David.”
c31840	That is why it is said,
c31841	“The blind and the lame will never enter the palace.”
c31842	So David took up residence in the fortress
c31843	and called it the City of David.
c31844	He built it up all the way around, from the supporting terraces inward.
c31845	And David became greater and greater,
c31846	for the LORD God of Hosts was with him.
c31847	King Hiram of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons,
c31848	and they built a palace for David.
c31849	And David realized
c31850	that the LORD had established him as king over Israel
c31851	and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.
c31852	David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem,
c31853	After he had arrived from Hebron,
c31854	and more sons and daughters were born to him.
c31855	These are the names
c31856	of the children born to him in Jerusalem:
c31857	Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
c31858	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
c31859	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
c31860	When the Philistines heard
c31861	that David had been anointed king over Israel,
c31862	they all went
c31863	in search of [him];
c31864	but [David] learned [of this]
c31865	and went down to the stronghold.
c31866	Now the Philistines had come
c31867	and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
c31868	So David inquired of the LORD,
c31869	replied
c31870	“Should I go up against the Philistines?
c31871	Will You deliver them into my hand?”
c31872	the LORD,
c31873	“Go,”
c31874	“for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hand.”
c31875	So David went to Baal-perazim,
c31876	where he defeated [the Philistines]
c31877	and said,
c31878	“Like a bursting flood, the LORD has burst out against my enemies before me.”
c31879	So he called that place Baal-perazim.
c31880	There the Philistines abandoned their idols,
c31881	and David and his men carried them away.
c31882	Once again the Philistines
c31883	came up
c31884	and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
c31885	So David inquired of the LORD,
c31886	who answered,
c31887	“Do not march straight up,
c31888	but circle around behind
c31889	them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.
c31890	As soon as
c31891	you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees,
c31892	move quickly,
c31893	because this will mean the LORD has marched out before you
c31894	to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
c31895	So David did
c31896	as the LORD had commanded him,
c31897	and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Geba
c31898	to Gezer.
c31899	David again assembled [the] choice [men] of Israel, thirty thousand in all.
c31901	And he and all his troops set out
c31903	for Baale of Judah
c31904	to bring up from there the ark of God,
c31905	which is called by the Name, the name of the LORD of Hosts
c31906	who is enthroned between the cherubim
c31907	that are on it.
c31908	They set the ark of God on a new cart
c31909	and brought it from the house of Abinadab,
c31910	which was on the hill.
c31911	Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart,
c31912	bringing ... from the house of Abinadab,
c31913	which [was] on the hill.
c31914	with it the ark of God
c31915	And Ahio was walking in front of the ark.
c31916	David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of wood [instruments], harps, stringed instruments, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.
c31917	When they came to the threshing floor of Nachon,
c31918	Uzzah reached out ... the ark of God,
c31919	and took hold of
c31920	because the oxen had stumbled.
c31921	And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah,
c31922	and God struck him down on the spot for his irreverence,
c31923	and he died there beside the ark of God.
c31924	Then David became angry
c31925	because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah;
c31926	so he named that place Perez-uzzah, as it is [called] to this day.
c31927	That day David feared the LORD
c31928	and asked,
c31929	“How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?”
c31930	So he was unwilling
c31931	to move the ark of the LORD to the City of David;
c31932	instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
c31933	Thus the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months,
c31934	and the LORD blessed [him] and all his household.
c31935	Now it was reported to King David,
c31937	“The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all
c31938	that belongs to him,
c31939	because of the ark of God.”
c31940	So David went
c31941	and had the ark of God brought up from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David with rejoicing.
c31943	When those carrying the ark of the LORD had advanced six paces,
c31944	he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.
c31945	And David, ... danced with all his might before the LORD,
c31946	wearing a linen ephod,
c31947	while he and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouts and the sound of the trumpets.
c31949	As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David,
c31950	Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window
c31951	and saw King David
c31952	leaping
c31953	and dancing before the LORD,
c31954	and she despised him in her heart.
c31955	So they brought the ark of the LORD
c31956	and set it in its place inside the tent
c31957	that David had pitched for it.
c31958	Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
c31959	When David had finished
c31960	sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings,
c31961	he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of Hosts.
c31962	Then he distributed to all the multitude of Israel, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake. ... each
c31963	And all the people departed, ... for his own home.
c31964	As soon as David returned
c31965	home to bless his own household,
c31966	Saul’s daughter Michal came out
c31967	to meet him.
c31968	she said.
c31969	“How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today!”
c31970	“He has uncovered himself today in the sight of the maidservants of his subjects,
c31971	like a vulgar person would [do].”
c31972	But David said to Michal,
c31973	“I was dancing before the LORD
c31974	who chose me over your father and all his house
c31975	when He appointed me ruler over the LORD’s people Israel.
c31976	I will celebrate before the LORD,
c31977	and I will humiliate ... even more than this.
c31978	and humble myself
c31979	by the maidservants
c31980	of whom you have spoken.”
c31981	Yet I will be honored
c31982	And Michal the daughter of Saul
c31983	had no children to the day of her death.
c31984	After
c31985	the king had settled into his palace
c31986	and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,
c31987	[he] said to Nathan the prophet,
c31988	“Here
c31989	I am, living in a house of cedar,
c31990	while the ark of God remains in a tent.”
c31991	So Nathan told the king,
c31992	all
c31993	that [is] in your heart,
c31994	“Go
c31995	and do
c31996	for the LORD is with you.”
c31997	But that night ... came
c31998	the word of the LORD ... to Nathan,
c31999	saying,
c32000	“Go
c32001	and tell My servant David
c32002	that this is what the LORD says:
c32003	Are you the one to build for Me a house
c32004	to dwell in?
c32005	For I have not dwelt in a house from the day
c32006	I brought the Israelites out of Egypt
c32007	until this day,
c32008	but I have moved about with a tent as My dwelling.
c32009	In all
c32010	My journeys with all the Israelites,
c32011	have I ever asked any [of the leaders],
c32012	whom I commanded
c32013	to shepherd My people Israel,
c32015	‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’
c32016	Now
c32017	then, you are to tell My servant David
c32018	that this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c32019	I took you from the pasture, from following the flock,
c32020	to be the ruler over My people Israel.
c32021	I have been with you
c32022	wherever you have gone,
c32023	and I have cut off all your enemies from before you.
c32024	Now I will make for you a name like the greatest
c32025	in the land.
c32026	And I will provide a place for My people Israel
c32027	and will plant them
c32028	so that they may dwell in a place of their own
c32029	and be disturbed no more.
c32030	No longer will the sons of wickedness
c32031	oppress them
c32032	as they did at the beginning
c32033	and [have done] since the day
c32034	I appointed judges over My people Israel.
c32035	I will give you rest from all your enemies.
c32036	The LORD declares to you
c32037	that He Himself will establish a house for you.
c32038	And when your days are fulfilled
c32039	and you rest with your fathers,
c32040	I will raise up your offspring after you,
c32041	who will come from your own body,
c32042	and I will establish his kingdom.
c32043	He will build a house for My name,
c32044	and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
c32045	I will be his Father,
c32046	and he will be My son.
c32047	When he does wrong,
c32048	I will discipline him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men.
c32049	But My loving devotion will never depart from him
c32050	as I removed it from Saul,
c32051	whom I moved out of your way.
c32052	Your house and kingdom will endure forever before Me,
c32053	and your throne will be established forever.”
c32054	According to all these words and this entire vision,
c32055	so Nathan spoke to David.
c32056	Then King David went in,
c32057	sat before the LORD,
c32058	and said,
c32059	“Who am I,
c32060	O Lord GOD,
c32061	and what is my house,
c32062	that You have brought me this far?
c32063	And as if this was a small thing in Your eyes,
c32064	O Lord GOD,
c32065	You have also spoken about the future of the house of Your servant.
c32066	[Is] this Your custom with man,
c32067	O Lord GOD?
c32068	What more can David
c32069	say to You?
c32070	For You know Your servant,
c32071	O Lord GOD.
c32072	For the sake of Your word and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished this great thing
c32073	and revealed it to Your servant.
c32074	How great You are,
c32075	O Lord GOD!
c32076	For [there is] none like You,
c32077	and there is no God besides You, according to everything
c32078	we have heard with our own ears.
c32079	And who is like Your people Israel— the one nation on earth
c32080	whom God went out
c32081	to redeem as a people for Himself,
c32082	to make a name for Himself,
c32083	and to perform for them great and awesome wonders ... from before Your people,
c32084	by driving out nations and their gods ... whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt?
c32085	For You have established Your people Israel as Your very own forever,
c32086	and You,
c32087	O LORD,
c32088	have become their God.
c32089	And now,
c32090	O LORD God,
c32091	the word
c32092	You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house.
c32093	confirm forever
c32094	Do
c32095	as You have promised,
c32096	so that Your name will be magnified forever
c32097	when it is said,
c32098	‘The LORD of Hosts is God over Israel.’
c32099	And the house of Your servant David will be established before You.
c32100	For You,
c32101	O LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel,
c32102	have revealed [this] to Your servant
c32103	when You said,
c32104	‘I will build a house for you.’
c32105	Therefore Your servant has found the courage
c32106	to offer this prayer to You.
c32107	And now,
c32108	O Lord GOD,
c32109	You are God!
c32110	Your words are true,
c32111	and You have promised this goodness to Your servant.
c32112	Now therefore, may it please You
c32113	to bless the house of Your servant,
c32114	that it may continue forever before You.
c32115	For You,
c32116	O Lord GOD,
c32117	have spoken,
c32118	and with Your blessing the house of Your servant will be blessed forever.
c32119	Some time later,
c32120	David defeated the Philistines,
c32121	subdued them,
c32122	and took Metheg-ammah from the hand of the Philistines.
c32123	[David] also defeated the Moabites,
c32124	and he measured them off with a cord.
c32125	made them lie down on the ground,
c32126	He measured off with two lengths
c32127	those to be put to death,
c32128	and with one length
c32129	those to be spared.
c32130	So the Moabites became subject to David and brought him tribute.
c32131	David also defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
c32132	who had marched out
c32133	to restore his dominion along the Euphrates River.
c32134	David captured from him a thousand [chariots], seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot soldiers,
c32135	and he hamstrung all the horses
c32136	except a hundred he kept for the chariots.
c32137	When the Arameans of Damascus came
c32138	to help King Hadadezer of Zobah,
c32139	David struck down twenty-two thousand men.
c32140	Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus,
c32141	and the Arameans became subject to David and brought him tribute.
c32142	So the LORD made David victorious wherever
c32143	he went.
c32144	And David took the gold shields
c32145	that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer
c32146	and brought them to Jerusalem.
c32147	And from Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a great amount of bronze.
c32148	When King Toi of Hamath heard
c32149	that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,
c32150	he sent his son Joram ... King David
c32151	to greet
c32152	and bless him
c32153	for fighting against Hadadezer
c32154	and defeating him.
c32155	For Toi and Hadadezer had been at war.
c32156	[Joram] brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze,
c32157	and King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold
c32158	he had dedicated from all the nations
c32159	he had subdued—
c32160	from Edom and Moab, from the Ammonites and Philistines and Amalekites, and from the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
c32161	And David made a name for himself
c32162	when he returned
c32163	from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
c32164	He placed garrisons ... Edom,
c32165	throughout ... the Edomites
c32166	and all ... were subject to David.
c32167	So the LORD made David victorious wherever
c32168	he went.
c32169	Thus David reigned over all Israel
c32170	and administered justice and righteousness for all his people:
c32171	Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army;
c32172	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud [was] the historian;
c32173	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests;
c32174	Seraiah was the scribe;
c32175	Benaiah son of Jehoiada [was over]
c32176	the Cherethites and Pelethites;
c32177	and David’s sons were priests.
c32178	Then David asked,
c32180	“Is there
c32181	anyone left from the house of Saul
c32182	to whom I can show kindness for the sake of Jonathan?”
c32183	And there was a servant of Saul’s family
c32184	named Ziba.
c32185	They summoned him to David,
c32186	and the king inquired,
c32187	“Are you Ziba?”
c32188	he replied.
c32189	“I am your servant,”
c32190	So the king asked,
c32191	“Is there anyone left of Saul’s family ... still
c32192	to whom I can show the kindness of God?”
c32193	Ziba answered,
c32194	“There is ... Jonathan’s son,
c32195	[who is] lame in both feet.”
c32196	replied the king.
c32197	“Where is he?”
c32198	And Ziba said,
c32199	“Indeed, he [is] in Lo-debar at the house of Machir son of Ammiel.”
c32200	So King David
c32201	had him brought from the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.
c32202	And when Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David,
c32203	he fell facedown
c32204	in reverence.
c32205	Then David said,
c32206	“Mephibosheth!”
c32207	he replied.
c32208	“I am your servant,”
c32209	said David,
c32210	“Do not be afraid,”
c32211	“for surely I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan.
c32212	I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul,
c32213	and you will always eat at my table.”
c32214	Mephibosheth bowed down
c32215	and said,
c32216	“What is your servant,
c32217	that you should show regard for a dead dog
c32218	like me?”
c32219	Then the king summoned Saul’s servant Ziba ... to him,
c32220	and said
c32221	all
c32222	that belonged to Saul and to all his house.
c32223	“I have given to your master’s grandson
c32224	You and your sons and servants are to work the ground for him
c32225	and bring in [the harvest],
c32226	so that your master’s grandson may have food
c32227	to eat.
c32228	But Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, is always to eat at my table.”
c32229	Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
c32230	And Ziba said to the king,
c32231	all
c32232	“Your servant ... that my lord the king has commanded.”
c32233	will do
c32234	So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table like one of the king’s sons.
c32235	And Mephibosheth had a young son
c32236	named Mica,
c32237	and all who dwelt in the house of Ziba [were] servants of Mephibosheth.
c32238	So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem,
c32239	because he always ate at the king’s table,
c32240	and he was lame in both feet.
c32241	Some time later,
c32242	the king of the Ammonites died
c32243	and was succeeded by his son Hanun.
c32244	And David said,
c32245	“I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash,
c32246	just as his father showed kindness to me.”
c32247	So David sent
c32248	some of his servants to console [Hanun] concerning his father.
c32249	But when they arrived in the land of the Ammonites,
c32250	the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord,
c32251	do you really believe he is showing respect for your father?
c32252	“Just because David has sent you comforters,
c32253	Has not
c32254	to explore the city,
c32255	spy it out,
c32256	and overthrow it?”
c32257	David [instead] sent his servants
c32258	So Hanun took David’s servants,
c32259	shaved off half of each man's beard,
c32260	cut their garments in half at the hips,
c32261	and sent them away.
c32262	When this was reported to David,
c32263	he sent messengers
c32264	to meet [the men],
c32265	since they were deeply humiliated.
c32266	The king told them,
c32267	“Stay in Jericho
c32268	until your beards have grown back,
c32269	and [then] return.”
c32270	When the Ammonites realized that
c32271	they had become a stench to David,
c32272	they
c32273	hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth-rehob and Zoba,
c32274	as well as a thousand men from the king of Maacah
c32275	and twelve thousand men from Tob.
c32276	On hearing of this,
c32277	[David] sent Joab and the entire army of mighty men.
c32278	The Ammonites marched out
c32279	and arrayed themselves for battle at the entrance to their city gate,
c32280	while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.
c32281	When Joab saw
c32282	the battle lines before him and behind him,
c32283	he selected some of the best men of Israel
c32284	and arrayed them
c32285	against the Arameans.
c32286	And he placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai,
c32287	who arrayed them
c32288	against the Ammonites.
c32289	said Joab,
c32290	“If the Arameans are too strong for me,”
c32291	“then you will come to my rescue.
c32292	And if the Ammonites are too strong for you,
c32293	then I will come
c32294	to your rescue
c32295	Be strong
c32296	and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our God.
c32297	May the LORD do
c32298	what is good in His sight.”
c32299	So Joab and his troops advanced
c32301	to fight the Arameans,
c32302	who fled before him.
c32303	When the Ammonites saw
c32304	that the Arameans had fled,
c32305	they too fled before Abishai,
c32306	and they entered the city.
c32307	So Joab returned from [fighting] against the Ammonites
c32308	and came to Jerusalem.
c32309	When the Arameans saw
c32310	that they had been defeated by Israel,
c32311	they regrouped.
c32312	Hadadezer sent
c32313	messengers to bring [more] Arameans
c32314	from beyond the Euphrates,
c32315	and they came to Helam
c32316	with Shobach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.
c32317	When this was reported to David,
c32318	he gathered all Israel,
c32319	crossed the Jordan,
c32320	and went to Helam.
c32321	Then the Arameans arrayed themselves
c32322	against David
c32323	and fought against him.
c32324	But the Arameans fled before Israel,
c32325	and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers.
c32326	He also struck down Shobach commander of their army,
c32327	who died there.
c32328	When all the kings [who were] subject to Hadadezer saw
c32329	that they had been defeated by Israel,
c32330	they made peace with Israel
c32331	and became subject to them.
c32332	So the Arameans were afraid
c32333	to help the Ammonites anymore.
c32334	In the spring, at the time when
c32335	kings march out to war,
c32336	David sent Joab with his servants and the whole [army] of Israel.
c32337	They destroyed the Ammonites
c32338	and besieged Rabbah,
c32339	but David remained in Jerusalem.
c32340	One evening
c32341	David got up from his bed
c32342	and strolled around on the roof of the palace.
c32343	And from the roof he saw a woman bathing—
c32344	a very beautiful woman.
c32345	So David sent
c32346	and inquired about the woman,
c32347	and he was told,
c32348	“This is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.”
c32349	Then David sent messengers
c32350	to get her,
c32351	and when she came to him,
c32352	he slept with her.
c32353	(Now she had just purified herself from her uncleanness.)
c32354	Then she returned home.
c32355	And the woman conceived
c32356	and sent word
c32357	to David,
c32358	saying,
c32359	“I am pregnant.”
c32360	At this, David sent orders to Joab:
c32361	“Send me Uriah the Hittite.” ... to
c32362	So Joab sent [him] ... David.
c32363	When Uriah came to him,
c32364	David asked how Joab and the troops were doing with the war.
c32365	Then [he] said to Uriah,
c32366	“Go down to your house
c32367	and wash your feet.”
c32368	So Uriah left the palace,
c32369	and a gift from the king followed him.
c32370	But Uriah slept at the door of the palace with all his master’s servants;
c32371	he did not go down to his house.
c32372	When David was told,
c32373	questioned
c32374	“Uriah did not go home,”
c32375	[he] ... Uriah,
c32376	“Have you not just come from a journey?
c32377	Why did you not go home?”
c32378	Uriah answered,
c32379	“The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents,
c32380	and my master Joab and his soldiers are camped in the open field.
c32381	How can I go to my house
c32382	to eat
c32383	and drink
c32384	and sleep with my wife?
c32385	As surely as you live, and [as] your soul lives,
c32386	I will not do such a thing!”
c32387	David said to Uriah,
c32388	“Stay here one more day,”
c32389	“and tomorrow I will send you back.”
c32390	So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.
c32391	Then David invited
c32392	Uriah to eat ... with him,
c32393	and drink
c32394	and he got [Uriah] drunk.
c32395	And in the evening he went out
c32396	to lie down on his cot with his master’s servants,
c32397	but he did not go home.
c32398	The next morning
c32399	David wrote a letter to Joab
c32400	and sent it with Uriah.
c32401	In the letter he wrote:
c32403	“Put Uriah at the front of the fiercest battle;
c32404	then withdraw from him,
c32405	so that he may be struck down
c32406	and die.”
c32407	So as
c32408	Joab besieged the city,
c32409	he assigned Uriah to a place
c32410	where he saw
c32411	the strongest enemy soldiers.
c32412	And when the men of the city came out
c32413	and fought against Joab,
c32414	some of David’s servants fell,
c32415	and Uriah the Hittite also died.
c32416	Joab sent
c32417	to David a full account of the battle
c32418	and instructed the messenger,
c32420	“When you have finished ... all the details of the battle,
c32421	giving the king
c32423	if the king’s anger flares,
c32424	he may ask you,
c32425	‘Why did you get so close to the city
c32426	to fight?
c32427	Did you not realize
c32428	they would shoot from atop the wall?
c32429	Who [was the one] to strike Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth?
c32430	Was it not a woman who dropped an upper millstone on him from the wall,
c32431	so that he died in Thebez?
c32432	Why did you get so close to the wall?’
c32433	If so, then you are to say,
c32434	‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.’”
c32435	So the messenger set out
c32437	and reported to David all
c32438	that Joab had sent him to say.
c32439	The messenger said to David,
c32440	“The men overpowered us
c32441	and came out against us in the field,
c32442	but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.
c32443	Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall,
c32444	and some of the king’s servants were killed.
c32445	And your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.”
c32446	Then David told the messenger,
c32447	“Say this to Joab:
c32448	‘Do not let this matter upset you,
c32449	for the sword devours one as well as another.
c32450	Strengthen your attack against the city
c32451	and demolish it.’
c32452	Encourage him [with these words].”
c32453	When Uriah’s wife heard
c32454	that her husband was dead,
c32455	she mourned for him.
c32456	And when the [time of] mourning was over,
c32457	David
c32458	had her brought to his house,
c32459	and she became his wife
c32460	and bore him a son.
c32461	But the thing ... was evil
c32462	that David had done
c32463	in the sight of the LORD.
c32464	Then the LORD sent Nathan to David,
c32465	and when he arrived,
c32466	he said,
c32467	“There were two men in a certain city,
c32468	one rich
c32469	and the other poor.
c32470	The rich man had a great number of sheep and cattle,
c32471	but the poor man had nothing
c32472	except one small ewe lamb
c32473	that he had bought.
c32474	He raised it,
c32475	and it grew up with him and his children. It shared
c32476	his food
c32477	and drank from his cup;
c32478	it slept in his arms
c32479	and was like a daughter to him.
c32480	Now a traveler came to the rich man,
c32482	who refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle
c32483	to prepare for the traveler
c32484	who had come to him.
c32485	Instead, he took the poor man’s lamb
c32486	and prepared it for his guest.”
c32488	David burned with anger against the man
c32489	and said to Nathan:
c32490	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c32491	the man ... deserves to die!
c32492	who did this
c32493	he must pay for the lamb four times over.”
c32494	Because he has done this thing
c32495	and shown no pity,
c32496	Then Nathan said to David,
c32497	“You are that man!
c32498	This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c32499	‘I anointed you king over Israel,
c32500	and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
c32501	I gave your master’s house to you and your master’s wives into your arms.
c32502	I gave you the house of Israel and Judah,
c32503	and if that was not enough,
c32504	I would have given you even more.
c32505	Why then have you despised the command of the LORD
c32506	by doing
c32507	evil in His sight?
c32508	You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword
c32509	and took his wife as your own,
c32510	for you have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites.
c32511	Now, therefore,
c32512	the sword will never depart from your house,
c32513	because you have despised Me
c32514	and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite
c32515	to be your own.’
c32516	This is what the LORD says:
c32517	‘I will raise up adversity against you from your own house.
c32518	Before your very eyes I will take your wives
c32519	and give them to another,
c32520	and he will lie with them in broad daylight.
c32521	You have acted in secret,
c32522	but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.’”
c32523	Then David said to Nathan,
c32524	“I have sinned against the LORD.”
c32525	Nathan replied.
c32526	“The LORD has taken away your sin,”
c32527	“You will not die.
c32528	Nevertheless, because by this deed you have treated the LORD with utter contempt,
c32529	the son
c32530	born to you
c32531	will surely die.”
c32532	After Nathan had gone home,
c32533	the LORD struck the child
c32534	that Uriah’s wife had borne to David,
c32535	and he became ill.
c32536	David pleaded with God for the boy.
c32537	He fasted
c32538	and went into his house
c32539	and spent the night
c32540	lying [in sackcloth] on the ground.
c32541	The elders of his household stood beside him
c32542	to help him up from the ground,
c32543	but he was unwilling
c32544	and would not eat anything with them.
c32545	On the seventh day ... was
c32546	the child died.
c32547	But David’s servants were afraid
c32548	to tell him
c32549	that the child was dead,
c32550	for they said,
c32551	“Look,
c32552	while the child ... alive,
c32553	we spoke to him,
c32554	and he would not listen to us.
c32555	So how can we tell him
c32556	the child is dead?
c32557	He may even harm himself.”
c32558	When David saw
c32559	that his servants were whispering to each other,
c32560	he perceived
c32561	that the child was dead.
c32562	So he asked his servants,
c32563	“Is the child dead?”
c32564	they replied.
c32565	“He is dead,”
c32566	Then David got up from the ground,
c32567	washed
c32568	and anointed himself,
c32569	changed his clothes,
c32570	and went into the house of the LORD
c32571	and worshiped.
c32572	Then he went to his own house,
c32573	and at his request
c32574	they set food before him,
c32575	and he ate.
c32576	his servants asked.
c32577	“What [is] this
c32578	you have done?” ... but when
c32579	“While the child was alive,
c32580	you fasted
c32581	and wept,
c32582	he died,
c32583	you got up
c32584	and ate.”
c32585	[David] answered,
c32586	“While the child was alive,
c32587	I fasted
c32588	and wept,
c32589	for I said,
c32590	‘Who knows?
c32591	The LORD may be gracious
c32592	to me and let him live.’
c32593	But now that he is dead,
c32594	why should I fast?
c32595	Can
c32596	I bring him back again?
c32597	I will go to him,
c32598	but he will not return to me.”
c32599	Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba,
c32600	and he went to her
c32601	and lay with her.
c32602	So she gave birth to a son,
c32603	and they named him Solomon.
c32604	Now the LORD loved [the child]
c32605	and sent [word] through Nathan the prophet
c32606	to name him Jedidiah because the LORD [loved him].
c32607	Meanwhile, Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites
c32608	and captured the royal fortress.
c32609	Then Joab sent messengers to David
c32610	to say,
c32611	“I have fought against Rabbah
c32612	and have also captured the water supply.
c32613	Now, therefore,
c32614	assemble the rest of the troops,
c32615	lay siege to the city,
c32616	and capture it.
c32617	Otherwise I will capture the city,
c32618	and it will be named after me.”
c32619	So David assembled all the troops
c32620	and went to Rabbah;
c32621	and he fought against it
c32622	and captured it.
c32623	Then he took the crown from the head of their king.
c32624	It weighed a talent of gold
c32625	and was set with precious stones,
c32626	and it was placed on David’s head.
c32627	And David took a great amount of plunder from the city.
c32628	the people
c32629	who [were] there
c32630	[David] brought out
c32631	and put [them to work] with saws, iron picks, and axes,
c32632	and he made them work at the brick kilns.
c32633	He did the same to all the Ammonite cities.
c32634	Then [David] and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.
c32635	After some time,
c32636	the beautiful sister of David’s son Absalom.
c32637	with Tamar,
c32638	David’s son Amnon fell in love
c32639	Amnon ... with frustration
c32640	was sick
c32641	over his sister Tamar,
c32642	for she was a virgin,
c32643	and it seemed implausible for [him]
c32644	to do anything to her.
c32645	Now Amnon had a friend
c32646	named Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah.
c32647	Jonadab was a very shrewd man,
c32648	so he asked Amnon,
c32649	“Why are you, ... so depressed
c32650	the son of the king,
c32651	morning after morning?
c32652	Won't you tell me?”
c32653	Amnon replied,
c32654	“I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”
c32655	Jonadab told him,
c32656	“Lie down on your bed
c32657	and pretend you are ill.
c32658	When your father comes
c32659	to see you,
c32660	say to him,
c32661	‘Please let my sister Tamar come
c32662	and give me something to eat.
c32663	Let her prepare [it] in my sight
c32664	so I may watch her
c32665	and eat it from her hand.’”
c32666	So Amnon lay down
c32667	and feigned illness.
c32668	When the king came
c32669	to see him,
c32670	Amnon said,
c32671	“Please let my sister Tamar come
c32672	and make a couple of cakes in my sight,
c32673	so that I may eat from her hand.”
c32674	Then David sent word to Tamar at the palace:
c32676	“Please go to the house of Amnon your brother
c32677	and prepare a meal for him.”
c32678	So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon,
c32679	[who] was lying down.
c32680	She took some dough,
c32681	kneaded [it],
c32682	made cakes in his sight,
c32683	and baked them.
c32684	Then she brought the pan
c32685	and set it down before him,
c32686	but he refused
c32687	to eat.
c32688	said Amnon.
c32689	“Send everyone away!”
c32690	And everyone went out.
c32691	Then Amnon said to Tamar,
c32692	“Bring the food into the bedroom,
c32693	so that I may eat it from your hand.”
c32694	Tamar took the cakes
c32695	she had made
c32696	and went to her brother Amnon’s bedroom.
c32697	And when she had brought [them] to him
c32698	to eat,
c32699	he took hold of her
c32700	and said,
c32701	“Come,
c32702	lie with me,
c32703	my sister!”
c32704	she cried.
c32705	“No,
c32706	my brother!”
c32707	“Do not humiliate me,
c32708	for such a thing should never be done in Israel.
c32709	Do not do this disgraceful thing!
c32710	could I
c32711	Where ... ever take my shame?
c32712	And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel!
c32714	Please speak to the king,
c32715	for he will not withhold me from you.”
c32716	But [Amnon] refused
c32717	to listen to her,
c32718	and being stronger
c32719	,he violated her
c32720	and lay with her.
c32721	Then Amnon hated [Tamar] with such intensity ... his hatred
c32722	that ... was greater than
c32724	the love
c32725	he previously had.
c32726	he said to her.
c32727	“Get up!”
c32728	“Be gone!”
c32729	she replied,
c32730	“No,”
c32731	[is worse] than this great wrong
c32732	you have already done to me!”
c32733	“sending me away
c32734	But he refused
c32735	to listen to her.
c32736	Instead, he called to his attendant
c32738	and said,
c32739	“Throw this [woman] out
c32740	and bolt the door behind her!”
c32741	Now Tamar was wearing a robe of many colors,
c32742	because this is what the king’s virgin daughters wore.
c32743	So Amnon’s attendant threw her out
c32744	and bolted the door behind her.
c32745	And Tamar put ashes on her head
c32746	her robe.
c32748	and tore
c32749	And putting her hand on her head,
c32750	she went away
c32751	crying bitterly.
c32752	Her brother Absalom said to her:
c32753	“Has your brother Amnon been with you?
c32754	for now,
c32755	my sister.
c32756	Be quiet
c32757	He is your brother.
c32758	Do not take this thing to heart.”
c32759	So Tamar lived
c32760	as a desolate woman in the house of her brother Absalom.
c32761	When King David heard all this,
c32762	he was furious.
c32763	And Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad,
c32764	because he hated Amnon for
c32765	disgracing his sister Tamar.
c32766	Two years later, ... were
c32767	when Absalom’s sheepshearers ... at Baal-hazor
c32768	near Ephraim,
c32769	he invited all the king’s sons.
c32770	And he went to the king
c32771	and said,
c32772	“Your servant has just hired shearers. ... please
c32773	Will the king and his servants ... come with [me]?”
c32774	the king replied,
c32775	“No,
c32776	my son,”
c32777	“we should not all go,
c32778	or we would be a burden to you.”
c32779	Although Absalom urged him,
c32780	he was not willing
c32781	to go,
c32782	but gave him his blessing.
c32783	said Absalom,
c32784	“If not,”
c32785	“please let my brother Amnon go with us.”
c32786	the king asked.
c32787	“Why should he go with you?”
c32788	But Absalom urged him,
c32789	so he sent Amnon and the rest of the king’s sons.
c32790	Now Absalom had ordered his young men,
c32791	I order
c32792	“Watch ... until
c32793	Amnon ... his heart is merry with wine,
c32794	and when
c32795	you to strike Amnon {down},
c32796	you are to kill him.
c32797	Do not be afraid.
c32798	not
c32799	Have I ... commanded you?
c32800	Be courageous
c32801	and valiant!”
c32802	So Absalom’s young men did to Amnon
c32803	just as Absalom had ordered.
c32804	Then all the rest of the king’s sons got up,
c32806	and each one ... on his mule.
c32807	fled
c32808	were
c32809	While they ... on the way,
c32810	a report reached David:
c32812	“Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons;
c32813	not one of them is left!”
c32814	Then the king stood up,
c32815	tore his clothes,
c32816	and lay down on the ground;
c32817	and all his servants stood
c32818	by with their clothes torn.
c32819	But Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, spoke up:
c32820	think
c32821	“My lord must not
c32822	they have killed all the sons of the king,
c32823	for only Amnon is dead.
c32824	In fact, Absalom has planned this since the day
c32825	Amnon violated his sister Tamar.
c32826	So now,
c32827	my lord the king, do not take to heart the report that
c32829	all the king’s sons are dead.
c32830	Only Amnon is dead.”
c32831	Meanwhile, Absalom had fled.
c32832	When the young man ... looked up,
c32833	standing watch
c32835	he saw
c32836	many people coming down the road west of him, along the side of the hill. (And the watchman went and reported to the king, “I see men coming from the direction of Horonaim, along the side of the hill.”)
c32837	So Jonadab said to the king,
c32838	“Look, the king’s sons have arrived!
c32839	your servant said.”
c32840	It is just as
c32842	And as he finished
c32843	speaking,
c32844	the king’s sons came in,
c32845	loudly.
c32846	wailing
c32847	Then the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly.
c32848	Now Absalom fled
c32849	and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur.
c32850	But David mourned for his son every day.
c32851	After Absalom had fled
c32852	and gone to Geshur,
c32853	he stayed there three years.
c32854	Then the spirit of the king longed
c32855	to go to Absalom,
c32856	for he had been consoled over Amnon’s
c32857	death.
c32858	Now Joab son of Zeruiah perceived
c32859	that the king’s heart longed for Absalom.
c32860	So Joab sent to Tekoa
c32861	to bring a wise woman from there.
c32862	He told her,
c32863	“Please pretend to be a mourner;
c32864	put on clothes for mourning
c32865	and do not anoint yourself with oil.
c32866	Act like a woman
c32867	who has mourned for the dead a long time.
c32868	Then go to the king
c32869	and speak these words to him.”
c32870	And Joab put the words in her mouth.
c32871	When the woman from Tekoa went to the king, ... and said,
c32872	she fell facedown
c32873	in homage
c32875	“Help me,
c32876	O king!”
c32877	the king asked her.
c32878	“What troubles you?”
c32879	she said,
c32880	“Indeed,” ... “I [am] a widow,
c32881	for my husband is dead.
c32882	And your maidservant had two sons
c32883	[who] were fighting in the field
c32884	with no one to separate them,
c32885	struck
c32886	and one ... the other
c32887	and killed him.
c32888	Now the whole clan has risen up against your maidservant
c32889	and said,
c32890	‘Hand over the one who struck down his brother,
c32891	that we may put him to death for the life of the brother
c32892	whom he killed.
c32893	Then we will cut off the heir as well!’
c32894	So they would extinguish ... ember
c32895	my one remaining
c32896	by not preserving my husband’s name or posterity on the earth.”
c32897	the king said to the woman,
c32898	“Go home,”
c32899	“and I will give orders on your behalf.”
c32900	But the woman of Tekoa said to the king,
c32901	be on
c32902	“My lord the king,
c32903	may any blame
c32904	me and my father’s house,
c32905	and may the king and his throne [be] guiltless.”
c32906	said the king,
c32907	“If anyone speaks to you,”
c32908	“bring him to me,
c32909	and he will not ... you again!”
c32910	trouble
c32911	she replied,
c32912	“Please,” ... “may the king invoke the LORD your God to prevent the avenger of blood from increasing
c32913	the devastation,
c32914	so that my son may not be destroyed!”
c32915	he vowed,
c32916	“As surely as the LORD lives,”
c32917	“not a hair of your son's head will fall to the ground.”
c32918	Then the woman said,
c32919	“Please, may your servant speak a word to my lord the king?”
c32920	he replied.
c32921	“Speak,”
c32922	The woman asked,
c32923	“Why have you devised a thing like this against the people of God?
c32924	When the king says this, does he not convict himself,
c32925	since [he] has not brought back his own banished [son]?
c32926	For surely we will die
c32927	and be like water
c32928	poured out on the ground,
c32929	which cannot be recovered.
c32930	Yet God does not take away a life;
c32931	but He devises ways
c32932	so that the banished one may not remain estranged from Him.
c32933	Now therefore,
c32934	I have come
c32935	to present this matter to my lord the king
c32936	because the people have made me afraid.
c32937	Your servant thought:
c32938	I will speak to the king.
c32939	Perhaps [he] will grant the request of his maidservant.
c32940	For the king will hear
c32941	and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man
c32942	[who would] cut off both me and my son from God’s inheritance.
c32943	Your servant thought:
c32944	May the word of my lord the king bring me rest, ... be
c32945	for ... just like the Angel of God.
c32946	my lord the king
c32947	is able to discern good and evil,
c32948	May the LORD your God ... with you.”
c32949	Then the king said to
c32950	the woman, ... replied.
c32951	you something; do not conceal it from me!”
c32952	“I am going to ask
c32953	she
c32954	“Let my lord the king speak,”
c32955	So the king asked,
c32956	“Is the hand of Joab behind all this?”
c32957	The woman answered,
c32959	“As surely as you live,
c32960	my lord the king,
c32961	no one can turn
c32962	to the right
c32963	or to the left from anything
c32964	that my lord the king says.
c32965	Yes, your servant Joab
c32966	is the one who gave me orders;
c32967	he told your maidservant exactly what to say.
c32968	to bring about this change of affairs,
c32969	Joab your servant has done this
c32970	but my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the Angel of God,
c32971	to know everything
c32972	that [happens] in the land.”
c32973	Then the king said to Joab,
c32974	“I hereby grant this request.
c32975	Go,
c32976	bring back the young man Absalom.”
c32977	Joab fell facedown
c32978	in homage
c32979	and blessed the king.
c32980	said Joab,
c32981	“Today,” ... “your servant knows
c32982	that he has found favor with you,
c32983	my lord the king,
c32984	because the king has granted his request.”
c32985	So Joab got up,
c32986	went to Geshur,
c32987	and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
c32988	But the king added,
c32989	“He may return to his house,
c32990	but he must not see my face.”
c32991	So Absalom returned to his own house,
c32992	but he did not see the king.
c32993	Now there was not a man in all Israel as handsome ... as Absalom.
c32994	and highly praised
c32995	From the sole of his foot to the top of his head, he did not have a single flaw.
c32996	And when he cut the hair of his head—
c32997	it every year
c32998	he shaved
c32999	because his hair got so heavy—
c33001	he would weigh [it] [to be] two hundred shekels according to the royal standard.
c33002	Three sons were born to Absalom, and a daughter
c33003	named Tamar,
c33004	who was a beautiful woman.
c33005	Now Absalom lived in Jerusalem two years
c33006	without seeing the face of the king.
c33007	Then [he] sent for Joab
c33008	to send him to the king,
c33009	but Joab refused
c33010	to come.
c33011	So [Absalom] sent the second [time],
c33012	but [Joab] still would not
c33013	come.
c33014	So Absalom said to his servants,
c33015	“Look,
c33016	Joab's field is next to mine,
c33017	and he has barley there.
c33018	Go
c33019	and set fire to it!”
c33020	And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
c33021	Then Joab
c33022	came to Absalom’s house
c33023	and demanded,
c33024	“Why did your servants set my field on fire?”
c33027	said Absalom,
c33028	“Look,” ... “I sent for
c33029	you and said,
c33030	‘Come here.
c33031	I want to send you to the king
c33032	to ask:
c33033	Why have I come back from Geshur?
c33034	[It would be] better for me
c33035	[if] I [were] still there.’
c33036	So now,
c33037	let me see the king's face,
c33038	and if there is iniquity in me,
c33039	let him kill me.”
c33040	So Joab went
c33041	and told [the king],
c33042	and David summoned Absalom, ... to
c33043	who came ... [him]
c33044	and bowed facedown before him.
c33045	Then the king kissed Absalom.
c33046	Some time later,
c33047	Absalom provided for himself a chariot with horses
c33048	and fifty men to run before him.
c33049	He would get up early
c33050	and stand beside the road leading to the city gate.
c33051	had
c33052	Whenever anyone
c33053	a grievance
c33054	to bring before the king for a decision,
c33055	Absalom would call out
c33056	and ask,
c33057	“What city are you from?”
c33058	And if he replied,
c33059	“Your servant [is] from one of the tribes of Israel,”
c33060	Absalom would say,
c33061	“Look,
c33062	your claims are good and right,
c33063	but the king [has] no deputy to hear you.”
c33064	And [he] would add,
c33065	“If only someone would appoint me judge in the land,
c33066	then everyone ... could come to me,
c33067	with a grievance or dispute
c33068	and I would give him justice.”
c33069	Also, when
c33070	anyone approached
c33071	to bow down to him,
c33072	Absalom would reach out his hand,
c33073	take hold of him,
c33074	and kiss him.
c33075	Absalom did this to all the Israelites
c33076	who came to the king for justice.
c33077	In this way he stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
c33078	After four years had passed,
c33079	Absalom said to the king,
c33080	“Please let me go
c33081	to fulfill a vow
c33082	I have made to the LORD.
c33083	to Hebron
c33084	For your servant made a vow
c33085	while dwelling in Geshur of Aram,
c33086	saying:
c33087	‘If indeed the LORD brings me back to Jerusalem,
c33088	I will worship the LORD in Hebron.’”
c33089	said the king.
c33090	“Go in peace,”
c33091	So [Absalom] arose
c33092	and went to Hebron.
c33093	Then Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes of Israel
c33094	with this message:
c33095	“When you hear the sound of the trumpet,
c33096	you are to say,
c33097	‘Absalom reigns in Hebron!’”
c33098	Two hundred men from Jerusalem accompanied Absalom.
c33099	They had been invited as guests
c33100	and they went along innocently,
c33101	for they knew nothing about the matter.
c33102	[he] sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, [to come] from his hometown of Giloh.
c33103	While [Absalom] was offering the sacrifices,
c33104	So the conspiracy gained strength,
c33105	following kept
c33106	and Absalom's ... increasing.
c33107	Then a messenger came to David
c33108	and reported,
c33109	“The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”
c33110	And David said to all the servants
c33111	with him in Jerusalem,
c33112	“Arise
c33113	and let us flee,
c33114	or we will not escape from Absalom!
c33115	quickly,
c33116	We must leave
c33117	or he will soon
c33118	overtake us,
c33119	heap disaster on us,
c33120	and put the city to the sword.”
c33121	The king’s servants replied,
c33122	“Whatever
c33123	our lord the king decides,
c33124	we are your servants.”
c33125	Then the king set out, and his entire household followed him.
c33126	But he left behind ten concubines
c33127	to take care of the palace.
c33128	So the king set out with all the people following him.
c33129	[He] stopped at the last house,
c33130	and all his servants marched past him—
c33131	all the Cherethites and Pelethites, and six hundred Gittites
c33132	who had followed him from Gath.
c33134	Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite,
c33135	“Why should you also go with us?
c33136	Go back
c33137	and stay with the new king,
c33138	since you are both a foreigner
c33139	and an exile from your homeland.
c33140	In fact, you arrived [only] yesterday;
c33141	should I make you ... with us today
c33142	wander around
c33143	while I ... am going?
c33144	do not know where I
c33145	Go back
c33146	and take your brothers
c33147	with you. May the LORD show you loving devotion and faithfulness.”
c33148	But Ittai answered the king,
c33150	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c33151	and as my lord the king lives,
c33152	wherever ... whether
c33153	my lord the king may be, ... there will
c33154	or death,
c33155	it means life
c33156	your servant be!”
c33157	said David to Ittai.
c33159	“March on then,”
c33160	So Ittai the Gittite marched past with all his men and all the little ones
c33161	who [were] with him.
c33162	Everyone in the countryside was weeping loudly
c33163	as all the people passed by.
c33164	And as the king crossed the Kidron Valley,
c33165	all the people also passed toward the way of the wilderness.
c33166	there,
c33167	Zadok was also ... and all the Levites with
c33168	him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God.
c33169	And they set down the ark of God,
c33170	and Abiathar offered
c33171	sacrifices until the people had finished
c33172	passing out of the city.
c33173	Then the king said to Zadok,
c33174	“Return the ark of God to the city.
c33175	If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD,
c33176	He will bring me back
c33177	and let me see [both] it and His dwelling place {again}.
c33178	But if He should say,
c33179	‘I do not delight in you,’
c33180	then here I am;
c33181	let Him do to me
c33182	whatever seems good to Him.”
c33183	The king also said to Zadok the priest,
c33184	“[Are you not] a seer?
c33185	Return to the city in peace
c33186	with your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. [You and Abiathar take] your two sons with you.
c33187	See,
c33188	I will wait at the fords of the wilderness
c33189	until word comes from you
c33190	to inform me.”
c33191	So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem
c33192	and stayed there.
c33193	But David continued up the [Mount of] Olives, weeping as he went up.
c33194	His head was covered,
c33195	and he was walking barefoot.
c33196	And all the people
c33197	with him
c33198	covered their heads
c33199	and went up, weeping as they went.
c33200	Now someone told David:
c33201	pleaded,
c33202	“Ahithophel [is] among the conspirators with Absalom.”
c33203	So David
c33204	please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!”
c33205	“O LORD,
c33206	When
c33207	David came to the summit,
c33208	where he used to worship God,
c33209	was there
c33210	to meet him
c33211	Hushai the Archite
c33212	with his robe torn
c33213	and dust on his head.
c33214	David said to him,
c33215	“If you go on with me,
c33216	you will be a burden to me,
c33217	but if you return to the city
c33218	and say to Absalom,
c33219	‘I ... your servant,
c33220	my king!
c33221	will be ... was your father’s servant,
c33222	In the past I
c33223	but now
c33224	I will be your servant,’
c33225	then you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me.
c33226	Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you?
c33228	everything
c33229	you hear from the king’s palace.
c33230	Report [to them]
c33231	Indeed, their two sons, ... are there with them.
c33232	Ahimaaz [son] of Zadok
c33233	and Jonathan [son] of Abiathar,
c33234	Send them to me with everything
c33235	you hear.”
c33236	So David's friend Hushai arrived ... the city.
c33237	in Jerusalem just as Absalom was entering
c33238	When David had gone a little beyond the summit,
c33239	Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there
c33240	to meet him.
c33241	He had a pair of saddled donkeys
c33242	loaded with two hundred [loaves] of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine.
c33243	said the king to Ziba.
c33244	“Why do you have these?”
c33245	Ziba replied,
c33246	“The donkeys are for the king’s household
c33247	to ride,
c33248	the bread and summer fruit
c33249	are for the young men to eat,
c33250	and the wine
c33251	is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”
c33252	asked the king.
c33253	“Where is your master’s grandson?”
c33254	And Ziba answered,
c33255	“Indeed, he is staying in Jerusalem,
c33256	for he has said,
c33257	‘Today, the house of Israel will restore to me the kingdom of my grandfather.’”
c33258	So the king said to Ziba,
c33259	“All ... is now yours!”
c33260	that [belongs] to Mephibosheth
c33261	said Ziba.
c33262	“I humbly bow before you,”
c33263	“May I find favor in your eyes,
c33264	my lord the king!”
c33265	As King David approached Bahurim,
c33266	a man from the family of the house of Saul was just coming out.
c33267	His name was Shimei son of Gera,
c33268	and as he approached,
c33269	he kept yelling out curses.
c33270	He threw stones at David and at all the servants of the king, ... on David’s
c33271	though the troops and all the mighty men [were] ... right and left.
c33272	And as ... Shimei said,
c33273	he yelled curses,
c33274	“Get out,
c33275	get out,
c33276	you worthless man of bloodshed!
c33277	The LORD has paid you back for all the blood of the house of Saul,
c33278	in whose place you have reigned,
c33279	and the LORD has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom.
c33280	See, you have come to ruin
c33281	because you are a man of bloodshed!”
c33282	Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king,
c33283	“Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?
c33284	Let me go over
c33285	and cut off his head!”
c33286	But the king replied,
c33287	“What have I to do with you,
c33288	O sons of Zeruiah?
c33289	If he curses me
c33290	because the LORD told him,
c33291	‘Curse David,’
c33292	who can ask,
c33293	‘Why did you do this?’”
c33294	Then David said to Abishai and all his servants,
c33295	“Behold, my own son,
c33296	my own flesh and blood,
c33297	seeks my life.
c33298	How much more, then, [this] Benjamite!
c33299	Leave him alone
c33300	and let him curse me,
c33301	for the LORD has told him so.
c33302	Perhaps the LORD will see my affliction
c33303	and repay me with good for the cursing [I receive] today.”
c33304	So David and his men proceeded along the road
c33305	as Shimei went along the ridge of the hill opposite him.
c33306	As Shimei went,
c33307	he yelled curses,
c33308	threw stones, ... at [David].
c33309	and flung dust
c33310	Finally, the king and all the people ... arrived,
c33311	with him
c33312	exhausted.
c33313	And there he refreshed himself.
c33314	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem,
c33315	and Ahithophel [was] with him.
c33316	And
c33317	David’s friend Hushai the Archite went to Absalom
c33318	and said to [him],
c33319	“Long live the king!
c33320	Long live the king!”
c33321	Absalom replied.
c33322	“Is this the loyalty [you show] your friend?”
c33323	“Why did you not go with your friend?”
c33324	Hushai answered.
c33325	“Not at all,”
c33326	“For
c33327	the one chosen by the LORD, by the people, and by all the men of Israel—
c33328	his I will be,
c33329	and with him I will remain.
c33330	Furthermore,
c33331	whom should I serve
c33332	if not the son? ... presence,
c33333	As I served in your father’s ... in yours.”
c33334	so also I will serve
c33335	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel,
c33336	“Give me counsel.
c33337	What should we do?”
c33338	Ahithophel replied,
c33339	“Sleep with your father’s concubines
c33340	whom he has left
c33341	to keep the palace.
c33342	When all Israel hears
c33343	that you have become a stench to your father,
c33344	then the hands of all ... will be strengthened.”
c33345	who are with you
c33346	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof,
c33347	and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
c33348	the advice of Ahithophel
c33349	Now in those days ... was like
c33350	the consultation of the word of God.
c33351	Such was the regard that both David and Absalom had for Ahithophel’s advice.
c33352	Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom,
c33353	“Let me choose twelve thousand men
c33354	and set out
c33355	tonight in pursuit of David.
c33356	I will attack
c33357	him while he is weak and weary;
c33358	I will throw him into a panic,
c33359	and all the people ... will flee;
c33360	with him
c33361	I will strike down only the king
c33362	and bring all the people back to you.
c33363	When everyone returns
c33364	except the man
c33365	you seek,
c33366	all the people will be at peace.”
c33367	This proposal seemed good to Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
c33368	Then Absalom said,
c33369	“Summon Hushai the Archite as well,
c33370	and let us hear
c33371	what ... has to say.”
c33372	he too
c33373	So Hushai came to Absalom,
c33374	[who] told him,
c33376	“Ahithophel has spoken this proposal.
c33377	Should we carry it out?
c33378	If not,
c33379	what do you say?”
c33380	Hushai replied,
c33381	the advice ... is not sound.”
c33382	“This time ... of Ahithophel
c33383	[He] continued,
c33384	“You know your father and his men.
c33385	They [are] mighty men,
c33386	and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs.
c33387	Moreover, your father [is] a man of war
c33388	who will not spend the night with the troops.
c33389	Surely by now he is hiding in a cave or some other location.
c33390	has been
c33391	If some of your troops fall first,
c33392	whoever hears [of it]
c33394	will say,
c33395	‘There ... a slaughter among the troops
c33396	who follow Absalom.’
c33397	Then
c33398	even the most valiant soldier
c33399	with the heart of a lion
c33400	will melt with fear,
c33401	because all Israel knows
c33402	that your father is a mighty man
c33403	who has valiant men
c33404	with him.
c33405	Instead, I advise
c33406	that all Israel from Dan to Beersheba— ... like the sand by ... be gathered
c33407	the sea— ... to you,
c33408	a multitude
c33409	and that you yourself lead them into battle.
c33410	Then we will attack [David] wherever
c33411	we find him,
c33412	and we ... on
c33413	will descend ... him like dew on the ground.
c33414	And of all the men ... not ... will remain.
c33415	with him,
c33416	even one
c33417	If he retreats to a city,
c33418	all Israel will bring ropes to that city,
c33419	and we will drag it down to the valley
c33420	until not even a pebble can be found.”
c33421	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said,
c33422	“The advice of Hushai the Archite [is] better than [that] of Ahithophel.”
c33423	For the LORD had purposed
c33424	to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel,
c33425	in order to bring disaster on Absalom.
c33426	So Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests,
c33427	“This is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel,
c33428	and this is what I have advised.
c33429	Now
c33430	send quickly
c33431	and tell David,
c33433	‘Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness,
c33434	but be sure to cross over.
c33435	Otherwise the king and all the people ... will be swallowed up.’”
c33436	with him
c33437	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel,
c33438	where a servant girl would come
c33439	and pass along information to them.
c33440	They in turn would go
c33441	and inform King David,
c33442	for they dared not
c33443	be seen
c33444	entering the city.
c33445	But a young man did see them
c33446	and told Absalom.
c33447	So the two left quickly
c33448	and came to the house of a man in Bahurim.
c33449	He had a well in his courtyard,
c33450	and they climbed down into it.
c33451	Then [the man's] wife took
c33452	a covering and spread it over the mouth of the well
c33453	and scattered grain over it,
c33454	so nobody would know a thing.
c33455	When Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house,
c33456	they asked,
c33457	“Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
c33458	she replied.
c33459	“They have crossed over the brook,”
c33460	The men searched
c33461	but did not find [them],
c33462	so they returned to Jerusalem.
c33464	After [the men] had gone,
c33465	Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed up out of the well
c33466	and went
c33467	to inform King David,
c33468	saying,
c33469	“Get up
c33470	and cross over the river at once,
c33471	for Ahithophel has given this advice against you.”
c33472	So David and all the people ... got up
c33473	with him
c33474	and crossed the Jordan.
c33475	By daybreak, there was no one left
c33476	who had not crossed the Jordan.
c33477	When Ahithophel saw
c33478	that his advice had not been followed,
c33479	he saddled his donkey
c33480	and set out
c33481	for his house in his hometown.
c33482	He put his affairs in order
c33483	and hanged himself.
c33484	So he died
c33485	and was buried in his father’s tomb.
c33486	Then David went to Mahanaim,
c33487	and Absalom crossed over the Jordan with all the men of Israel.
c33488	Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab.
c33489	Amasa was the son of a man
c33490	named Ithra, the Ishmaelite
c33491	who had married Abigail daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.
c33492	So the Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
c33494	When David came to Mahanaim,
c33495	[he was met by] Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim.
c33496	[They brought] beds, basins, and earthen vessels, as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,
c33497	honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd for David and his people
c33499	to eat.
c33500	For they said,
c33501	“The people have become hungry, exhausted, and thirsty in the wilderness.”
c33502	Then David reviewed his troops
c33504	and appointed over them commanders of hundreds and of thousands.
c33505	He sent out the troops,
c33506	a third under Joab,
c33507	a third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah,
c33508	and a third under Ittai the Gittite.
c33509	And the king said to the troops,
c33510	“I will surely march out with you as well.”
c33511	But the people pleaded,
c33512	“You must not go out!
c33513	For if we have to flee,
c33514	they will pay no attention to us.
c33515	Even if half of us die,
c33516	they will not care;
c33517	but you are worth ten thousand of us.
c33518	It is better for now
c33519	from the city.”
c33520	if you support us
c33521	the king replied.
c33522	whatever seems best to you,”
c33523	“I will do
c33524	So he stood beside the gate,
c33525	while all the troops marched out by hundreds and thousands.
c33526	Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai,
c33528	“Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.”
c33529	And all the people heard
c33530	the king’s orders to each of the commanders regarding Absalom.
c33531	So David’s army marched into the field
c33532	to engage Israel
c33533	in the battle, which took place in the forest of Ephraim.
c33534	There the people of Israel were defeated by David’s servants,
c33535	and the slaughter was great that day— twenty thousand [men].
c33536	The battle spread over the whole countryside,
c33537	the forest ... more
c33538	devoured ... people
c33539	and that day ... than the sword.
c33540	Now Absalom ... met the servants of David,
c33541	was riding on his mule when he
c33542	and as the mule went under the tangled branches of a large oak,
c33543	Absalom’s head was caught fast in the tree.
c33544	so that he was suspended in midair.
c33545	The mule
c33546	under him
c33547	kept going,
c33548	When one of the men saw this,
c33549	he told Joab,
c33551	“I just
c33552	saw Absalom
c33553	hanging in an oak tree!”
c33554	Joab exclaimed.
c33556	“You just
c33557	saw him!”
c33558	“Why did you not strike him to the ground right there?
c33560	I would have given you ten [shekels] of silver and a warrior's belt!”
c33561	The man replied,
c33562	“Even if a thousand [shekels] of silver were weighed out into my hands,
c33563	I would not raise my hand against the king’s son.
c33564	For we heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai,
c33566	‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.’
c33567	If I had jeopardized my own life—
c33568	and nothing is hidden from the king—
c33569	you would have abandoned me.”
c33570	But Joab declared,
c33571	“I am not going to wait like this with you!”
c33572	And he took three spears in his hand
c33573	and thrust them through the heart of Absalom
c33574	while he was still alive in the oak tree.
c33575	And ten young men who carried Joab's armor surrounded
c33576	Absalom, struck him,
c33577	and killed him.
c33578	Then Joab blew the trumpet,
c33579	and the troops broke off
c33580	their pursuit of Israel
c33581	because Joab had restrained them.
c33582	They took Absalom,
c33583	cast him into a large pit in the forest,
c33584	and piled a huge mound of stones over him.
c33585	Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled,
c33586	each to his home.
c33587	Absalom
c33588	During his lifetime, ... had set up for himself a pillar
c33589	in the King’s Valley,
c33590	for he had said,
c33591	“I have no son
c33592	to preserve the memory of my name.”
c33593	So he gave the pillar his name,
c33594	and to this day it is called Absalom's Monument.
c33595	Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said,
c33596	“Please let me run
c33597	and tell the king the good news
c33598	that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.”
c33599	But Joab replied,
c33600	“You are not the man to take good news today.
c33601	You may do it another day,
c33602	but you must not [do so] today,
c33603	because the king’s son is dead.”
c33604	So Joab said to a Cushite,
c33605	“Go,
c33606	tell the king
c33607	what you have seen.”
c33608	The Cushite bowed to Joab
c33609	and took off running.
c33610	Ahimaaz son of Zadok, however, persisted
c33611	and said to Joab,
c33612	“Regardless of whatever may happen,
c33613	please let me also run behind the Cushite!”
c33614	Joab replied,
c33615	“why do you want to run,
c33616	“My son,”
c33617	since you will not receive a reward?”
c33618	“No matter what, ... he replied.
c33619	I want to run!”
c33620	Joab told him.
c33621	“Then run!”
c33622	So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain
c33623	and outran the Cushite.
c33624	Now David was sitting between the two gates
c33625	when the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall,
c33626	looked out,
c33627	and saw
c33628	a man running alone.
c33629	So [he] called out
c33630	and told the king.
c33631	the king replied,
c33632	“If he is alone,”
c33633	“he bears good news.”
c33634	As the first runner drew near,
c33635	the watchman saw another man
c33636	running,
c33637	and he called out to the gatekeeper,
c33638	said
c33639	“Look! Another man is running alone!”
c33640	the king.
c33641	“This [one] also brings news,”
c33642	The watchman said,
c33643	“The first man appears to me to be running like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.”
c33644	said the king.
c33645	“This is a good man,”
c33646	“He comes with good news.”
c33647	Then Ahimaaz called out
c33648	to the king, ... He continued,
c33649	“All is well!”
c33650	And he bowed down facedown before the king.
c33652	“Blessed [be] the LORD your God!
c33653	He has delivered up the men
c33654	who raised their hands against my lord the king.”
c33655	The king asked,
c33656	“Is the young man Absalom safe?”
c33657	And Ahimaaz replied,
c33658	I saw a great tumult,
c33659	“When Joab sent the king’s servant and your servant,
c33660	but I do not know what it was.”
c33661	said the king,
c33662	“Move aside,”
c33663	“and stand here.”
c33664	aside.
c33665	So he stepped
c33666	Just then the Cushite came
c33667	and said,
c33668	“May my lord the king hear the good news:
c33669	Today the LORD has avenged you of all
c33670	who rose up against you!”
c33671	The king asked the Cushite,
c33672	“Is the young man Absalom all right?”
c33673	And the Cushite replied,
c33674	“May what has become of the young man happen to the enemies of my lord the king
c33675	and to all
c33676	who rise up against you to harm you.”
c33677	The king was shaken
c33678	and went up to the gate chamber
c33679	and wept.
c33680	And as ... he cried out,
c33681	he walked,
c33682	“O my son Absalom!
c33683	My son, my son Absalom!
c33684	If only
c33685	I had died instead of you,
c33686	O Absalom, my son, my son!”
c33687	Then it was reported to Joab,
c33688	“The king is weeping
c33689	and mourning over Absalom.”
c33690	And that day’s victory was turned into mourning for all the people,
c33691	because on that day [they] were told,
c33693	“The king is grieving over his son.”
c33694	So they ... quietly that day,
c33695	returned to the city
c33696	as people steal away
c33697	in humiliation
c33698	after fleeing a battle.
c33699	But the king covered his face
c33700	and cried out at the top of his voice,
c33701	“O my son Absalom!
c33702	O Absalom, my son, my son!”
c33703	Then Joab went into the house ... to the king,
c33704	and said
c33705	“Today you have disgraced all your servants
c33706	who have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, of your wives, and of your concubines.
c33707	You love those who hate you
c33708	and hate those who love you!
c33709	For you have made it clear today that
c33710	the commanders and soldiers mean nothing to you.
c33711	I know today that
c33713	if Absalom were alive
c33714	and all of us were dead,
c33715	it would have pleased you!
c33716	Now therefore get up!
c33717	Go out
c33718	and speak comfort to your servants,
c33719	for I swear by the LORD
c33720	that if you do not go out,
c33721	not a man will remain with you tonight.
c33722	This will be worse for you than all the adversity
c33723	that has befallen you from your youth until now!”
c33724	So the king got up
c33725	and sat in the gate,
c33726	and all the people were told:
c33728	“Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.”
c33729	So they all came before the king.
c33730	Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled,
c33731	each man to his home.
c33733	And all the people throughout the tribes of Israel were arguing,
c33735	“The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies
c33736	and rescued us from the hand of the Philistines,
c33737	but now he has fled the land because of Absalom.
c33738	But Absalom,
c33739	the man we anointed over us,
c33740	has died in battle.
c33741	So
c33742	why do you say nothing
c33743	about restoring the king?”
c33744	Then King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: ... to
c33746	“Say ... the elders of Judah, ... to
c33748	‘Why should you be the last
c33749	to restore the king ... his palace,
c33750	since the talk of all Israel has reached the king at his quarters?
c33751	You are my brothers,
c33752	my own flesh and blood. ... should you
c33753	So why ... be the last
c33754	to restore the king?’
c33755	And say to Amasa,
c33756	‘Aren’t you my flesh and blood?
c33757	May God punish me,
c33758	and ever so severely,
c33759	if from this time you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab!’”
c33760	So [Amasa] swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man,
c33761	and they sent word to the king:
c33762	“Return, you and all your servants.”
c33763	So the king returned,
c33764	and when he arrived at the Jordan,
c33765	[the men of] Judah came to Gilgal
c33766	to
c33767	meet [him]
c33768	and escort him across the Jordan.
c33769	Then Shimei son of Gera, a Benjamite ... hurried
c33770	from Bahurim,
c33771	down with the men of Judah
c33772	to meet King David,
c33773	along with a thousand men of Benjamin
c33774	and Ziba, the steward of the house of Saul,
c33775	and his fifteen sons and twenty servants.
c33776	They rushed down to the Jordan before the king
c33777	and crossed at the ford
c33778	to carry over the king’s household
c33779	and to do
c33780	what was good in his sight.
c33781	When Shimei son of Gera ... he fell down before the king
c33782	crossed the Jordan,
c33783	and said,
c33784	“My lord, do not hold me guilty,
c33785	and do not remember
c33786	your servant’s wrongdoing on the day
c33787	my lord the king left Jerusalem.
c33788	May the king not take it to heart.
c33789	For your servant knows
c33790	that I have sinned,
c33791	so here I am
c33792	today as the first of all the house of Joseph
c33793	to come down
c33794	to meet my lord the king.”
c33795	But Abishai son of Zeruiah said,
c33797	“Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this,
c33798	because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?”
c33799	And David replied,
c33800	what have I to do with you,
c33801	“Sons of Zeruiah,
c33802	that you should be my adversaries today? ... that
c33803	Should any man be put to death in Israel today?
c33804	Am I not indeed aware
c33805	today I am king over Israel?”
c33806	So the king said to Shimei,
c33807	“You shall not die.”
c33808	Then the king swore an oath to him.
c33809	Then Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, went down
c33810	to meet the king.
c33811	He had not cared for his feet
c33812	[or] trimmed his mustache
c33813	[or] washed his clothes from the day
c33814	the king had left
c33815	until the day
c33816	he returned safely.
c33817	And
c33818	he came from Jerusalem
c33819	to meet the king,
c33820	[who] asked him,
c33821	why did you not go with me?”
c33822	“Mephibosheth,
c33823	he replied,
c33824	“My lord the king,”
c33825	But my servant [Ziba] deceived me,
c33826	[I] said,
c33827	‘I will have my donkey saddled
c33828	so that I may ride on it
c33829	and go with the king.’
c33830	“because [I] am lame,
c33831	and he has slandered your servant to my lord the king.
c33832	Yet my lord the king [is] like the Angel of God,
c33833	so do
c33834	[what is] good in your eyes.
c33835	For all the house of my grandfather
c33836	deserves death from my lord the king,
c33837	yet you have set your servant among those who eat at your table.
c33838	What further right, then, do I have
c33839	to keep appealing to the king?”
c33840	The king replied,
c33841	“Why say any more?
c33842	I hereby declare
c33843	that you and Ziba are to divide the land.”
c33844	And Mephibosheth said to the king,
c33845	“Instead, ... let Ziba take it all!”
c33846	since my lord the king has safely come to his own house,
c33847	Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim
c33848	to cross the Jordan with the king
c33849	and send him on his way [from there].
c33850	Barzillai was quite old,
c33851	eighty years of age,
c33852	he had provided for the king while he stayed in Mahanaim.
c33853	and since he was a very wealthy man,
c33854	The king said to Barzillai,
c33855	“Cross over with me,
c33856	and I will provide for you at my side in Jerusalem.”
c33857	But Barzillai replied,
c33858	“How many years of my life [remain],
c33859	that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?
c33860	I am now eighty years old.
c33861	Can I discern what is good and what is not?
c33862	Can your servant taste
c33863	what he eats
c33864	or drinks?
c33865	Can I still hear the voice of singing men and women?
c33866	Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
c33867	Your servant could go with the king only a short distance past the Jordan;
c33868	why should the king repay me with such a reward?
c33869	Please let your servant return,
c33870	that I may die in my own city near the tomb of my father and mother.
c33871	But here is your servant Chimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king,
c33872	and do for him
c33873	what is good in your sight.”
c33874	The king replied,
c33875	“Chimham will cross over with me,
c33876	and I will do for him
c33877	what seems good in your sight,
c33878	whatever
c33879	you desire of me.”
c33880	and I will do for you
c33881	So all the people crossed the Jordan,
c33882	and then the king crossed over.
c33883	The king kissed Barzillai
c33884	and blessed him,
c33885	and Barzillai returned home.
c33886	Then the king went on to Gilgal,
c33887	and Chimham crossed over with him.
c33888	All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king.
c33889	Soon all the men of Israel came to the king
c33890	and asked,
c33891	“Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, take you away secretly
c33892	and bring the king and his household across the Jordan,
c33893	together with all of David’s men?”
c33894	And all the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel,
c33895	“[We did this] because the king is our relative.
c33896	Why does this anger you?
c33897	Have we ever eaten at the king's [expense]
c33898	or received anything for ourselves?”
c33899	answered the men of Israel,
c33901	“We have ten shares in the king,”
c33902	“so we have more claim to David than you.
c33903	Why then do you despise us?
c33904	Were we not the first to speak
c33905	of restoring our king?”
c33906	But the men of Judah pressed even harder [than] the men of Israel.
c33907	Now a worthless man ... happened to be there,
c33908	named Sheba son of Bichri, a Benjamite,
c33909	and he blew the ram’s horn
c33910	and shouted:
c33911	“We have no share in David,
c33912	no inheritance in Jesse’s son.
c33913	Every man to his tent,
c33914	O Israel!”
c33915	So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bichri.
c33916	But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
c33917	When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem,
c33918	he took the ten concubines
c33919	he had left
c33920	to care for the palace
c33921	and placed them under guard.
c33922	He provided for them,
c33923	but he no longer slept with them.
c33924	They were confined until the day
c33925	of their death,
c33926	living as widows.
c33927	Then the king said to Amasa,
c33928	“Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days,
c33929	and be here yourself.”
c33930	So Amasa went
c33931	to summon Judah,
c33932	but he took longer than the time
c33933	allotted him.
c33934	And David said to Abishai,
c33935	“Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom.
c33936	Take your lord’s servants
c33937	and pursue him,
c33938	or he will secure fortified cities
c33939	and elude us.”
c33940	So Joab’s men, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men,
c33941	marched out of Jerusalem
c33942	in pursuit of Sheba son of Bichri.
c33943	[And while] they were at the great stone
c33944	in Gibeon,
c33945	Amasa joined them.
c33946	Now Joab was dressed in military attire,
c33947	and over it was a belt ... with a dagger
c33948	around his waist
c33949	in its sheath.
c33950	As he stepped forward,
c33951	the sword fell out.
c33952	Joab asked Amasa.
c33953	“Are you well,
c33954	my brother?”
c33955	And with his right hand Joab grabbed Amasa by the beard
c33956	to kiss him.
c33957	Amasa was not on guard against the dagger
c33958	in Joab’s hand,
c33959	and Joab stabbed him in the stomach
c33960	and spilled out his intestines on the ground.
c33961	And Joab did not need to strike him again,
c33962	for Amasa was dead.
c33963	Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri.
c33964	One of Joab's young men stood near Amasa
c33965	and said,
c33966	“Whoever
c33967	favors Joab,
c33968	and whoever
c33969	is for David,
c33970	[let him] follow Joab!”
c33971	But Amasa wallowed in his blood in the middle of the road,
c33972	and when the man saw
c33973	that all the troops were stopping there,
c33974	he dragged [the body] off the road into a field
c33975	and threw a garment over it.
c33980	As soon as [Amasa's body] was removed from the road,
c33981	all the men went on with Joab
c33982	to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.
c33983	Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel toward Abel-Beth-Maacah,
c33984	through the entire [region of] the Berites,
c33985	who gathered together
c33986	and followed him.
c33987	And Joab’s troops came
c33988	and besieged [Sheba] in Abel-Beth-Maacah
c33989	and built a siege ramp ... of the city.
c33990	against the outer rampart
c33991	As all the troops
c33992	with Joab
c33993	were battering
c33994	the wall to topple it,
c33995	a wise woman called out from the city,
c33996	“Listen!
c33997	Listen!
c33998	Please tell Joab ... with him.”
c33999	to come here
c34000	so that I may speak
c34001	When he had come near to her,
c34002	the woman asked,
c34003	“Are you Joab?”
c34004	he replied.
c34005	“I [am],”
c34006	she said.
c34007	“Listen to the words of your servant,”
c34008	he answered.
c34009	“I am listening,”
c34010	Then [the woman] said,
c34012	“Long ago they used to say,
c34014	‘Seek counsel at Abel,’
c34015	and that is how disputes were settled.
c34016	I [am] [among the] peaceable [and] faithful in Israel,
c34017	but you are trying
c34018	to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel.
c34019	Why would you swallow up the LORD’s inheritance?”
c34020	Joab
c34021	declared.
c34022	“Far be it!”
c34023	“Far be it from me
c34024	to swallow up
c34025	or destroy!
c34026	That [is] not the case.
c34027	But a man ... from the hill country of Ephraim,
c34028	named Sheba son of Bichri,
c34029	has lifted up his hand against the king, against David.
c34030	Deliver him alone,
c34031	and I will depart from the city.”
c34032	the woman replied,
c34033	“Look,” ... “his head will be thrown to you over the wall.”
c34034	Then the woman went to all the people with her wise counsel,
c34035	and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri
c34036	and threw it to Joab.
c34037	So he blew the trumpet
c34038	and [his men] dispersed from the city,
c34039	each to his own home.
c34040	And Joab returned to the king in Jerusalem.
c34041	Now Joab was over the whole army of Israel;
c34042	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites;
c34043	Adoniram was in charge of forced labor;
c34044	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;
c34045	Sheva was the scribe;
c34046	Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
c34047	and Ira the Jairite was David’s priest.
c34048	Now during the reign of David there was a famine for three successive years,
c34049	and David sought the face of the LORD.
c34050	And the LORD said,
c34051	“It is because of the blood shed by Saul and his family,
c34052	because he killed the Gibeonites.”
c34053	At this, David summoned ... (Now the Gibeonites
c34054	and spoke to them.
c34055	the Gibeonites
c34056	were not Israelites,
c34057	but a remnant of the Amorites.
c34058	The Israelites had taken an oath concerning them,
c34059	Saul had sought
c34060	to kill them.)
c34061	but in his zeal for Israel and Judah,
c34062	So David asked the Gibeonites,
c34063	“What shall I do for you?
c34064	How can I make amends
c34065	so that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?”
c34066	The Gibeonites said to him,
c34067	“We need no silver or gold from Saul or his house,
c34068	nor should you ... for us.”
c34069	put to death
c34070	anyone in Israel
c34071	ask,
c34072	“Whatever
c34073	you ... he replied.
c34074	I will do for you,”
c34075	And they answered the king,
c34076	“As for the man
c34077	who consumed us
c34078	and plotted against us
c34079	to exterminate us
c34080	from existing within any border of Israel,
c34081	let seven of his male descendants be delivered to us
c34082	so that we may hang them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD.”
c34083	said the king.
c34084	“I will give them to you,”
c34085	Now the king spared son of Jonathan, Mephibosheth the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD
c34086	between David and Jonathan son of Saul.
c34087	But the king took ... the two sons ... Rizpah daughter of Aiah
c34088	whom ... had borne to Saul,
c34089	Armoni and Mephibosheth,
c34090	and the five sons ... Merab daughter of Saul
c34091	whom ... had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite,
c34092	and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites,
c34093	and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD.
c34094	So all seven of them fell together;
c34095	they were put to death in the first days of the harvest, at the beginning of the barley harvest.
c34096	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth
c34097	and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest
c34098	until the rain from heaven poured down on the bodies,
c34099	she did not allow the birds of the air
c34100	to rest on them by day,
c34101	nor the beasts of the field by night.
c34102	When David was told
c34103	what Saul’s concubine Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, had done,
c34104	he went
c34105	and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead,
c34106	[who] had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan
c34107	where the Philistines had hung [the bodies] after
c34108	[they] had struck down Saul at Gilboa.
c34109	[So David had] the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan brought from there,
c34110	[along with] the bones of those who had been hanged.
c34111	And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in Zela in the land of Benjamin, in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish.
c34112	they had done everything
c34113	the king had commanded,
c34114	After ... God answered their prayers for the land.
c34115	Once again the Philistines waged war against Israel,
c34116	and David and his servants went down
c34117	and fought against the Philistines;
c34118	but David became exhausted.
c34119	Then Ishbi-benob,
c34120	a descendant of Rapha,
c34121	whose bronze spear weighed three hundred [shekels]
c34122	and who was bearing a new [sword],
c34123	resolved
c34124	to kill David.
c34125	But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to his aid,
c34126	struck the Philistine,
c34127	and killed him.
c34128	Then David’s men swore to him,
c34130	“You must never again go out with us to battle,
c34131	so that the lamp of Israel may not be extinguished.”
c34132	Some time later, there was
c34133	another battle with the Philistines at Gob.
c34134	At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph,
c34135	one of the descendants of Rapha.
c34136	Once again there was a battle with the Philistines at Gob,
c34137	and Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed [the brother of] Goliath the Gittite,
c34138	the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
c34139	And there was still another battle at Gath,
c34140	where there was a man of [great] stature with
c34141	six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—
c34142	twenty-four in all.
c34143	He too was descended from Rapha,
c34144	and when he taunted Israel,
c34145	Jonathan the son of David's brother Shimei killed him.
c34146	So these four descendants of Rapha in Gath
c34147	fell at the hands of David and his servants.
c34148	David sang this song to the LORD on the day
c34149	the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
c34150	He said:
c34151	“The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.
c34152	My God [is] my rock,
c34153	in whom I take refuge,
c34154	my shield, and the horn of my salvation.
c34155	My stronghold, my refuge, and my Savior,
c34156	You save me from violence.
c34157	I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised;
c34158	so shall I be saved from my enemies.
c34159	For the waves of death engulfed me;
c34160	the torrents of chaos overwhelmed me.
c34161	The cords of Sheol entangled me;
c34162	the snares of death confronted me.
c34163	In my distress I called upon the LORD;
c34164	I cried out to my God.
c34165	And from His temple He heard my voice,
c34166	and my cry for help reached His ears.
c34167	shook
c34168	Then the earth ... and quaked;
c34169	the foundations of the heavens trembled;
c34170	they were shaken
c34171	because He burned with anger.
c34172	Smoke rose from His nostrils,
c34173	and consuming fire came from His mouth;
c34174	glowing coals flamed forth.
c34175	He parted the heavens
c34176	and came down
c34177	with dark clouds beneath His feet.
c34178	He mounted a cherub
c34179	and flew;
c34180	He soared on the wings of the wind.
c34181	He made darkness a canopy around Him,
c34182	a gathering of water and thick clouds.
c34183	From the brightness of His presence, coals of fire blazed forth.
c34184	The LORD thundered from heaven;
c34185	the voice of the Most High resounded.
c34186	He shot His arrows
c34187	and scattered [the foes];
c34188	He hurled lightning
c34189	and routed them.
c34190	The channels of the sea appeared,
c34191	the foundations of the world were exposed at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
c34192	He reached down from on high
c34193	and took hold of me;
c34194	He drew me out of deep waters.
c34195	He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes,
c34196	for they were too mighty for me.
c34197	They confronted me in my day of calamity,
c34198	but the LORD was my support.
c34199	He brought me out into the open;
c34200	He rescued me
c34201	because He delighted in me.
c34202	The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness;
c34203	He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.
c34204	For I have kept the ways of the LORD
c34205	and have not wickedly departed from my God.
c34206	For all His ordinances [are] before me;
c34207	His statutes.
c34208	I have not disregarded
c34209	And I have been blameless before Him
c34210	and kept myself from iniquity.
c34211	So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in His sight.
c34212	To the faithful You show Yourself faithful,
c34213	and to the blameless You show Yourself blameless,
c34214	to the pure You show Yourself pure,
c34215	but to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd.
c34216	You save an afflicted people,
c34217	but Your eyes are on the haughty
c34218	to bring [them] down.
c34219	For You, ... are my lamp;
c34220	O LORD,
c34221	the LORD enlightens my darkness.
c34222	For in you I can charge an army;
c34223	with my God I can scale a wall.
c34224	[As for] God,
c34225	His way is perfect;
c34226	the word of the LORD is flawless.
c34227	He is a shield to all
c34228	who take refuge in Him.
c34229	For who is God besides the LORD?
c34230	And who [is] the rock except our God?
c34231	God ... fortress
c34232	is my strong
c34233	and He makes my way blameless.
c34234	He makes my feet like the feet of a deer
c34235	and stations me upon the heights.
c34236	He trains my hands for battle;
c34237	my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
c34238	You have given me Your shield of salvation;
c34239	and Your gentleness
c34240	exalts me.
c34241	You broaden the path beneath me
c34242	so that my ankles do not give way.
c34243	I pursued my enemies
c34244	and destroyed them;
c34245	I did not turn back
c34246	until they were consumed.
c34247	I devoured
c34248	and crushed them
c34249	so they could not rise;
c34250	they have fallen under my feet.
c34251	You have armed me with strength for battle;
c34252	You have subdued my foes beneath me.
c34253	my enemies
c34254	You have made ... retreat before me;
c34255	to those who hated me.
c34256	I put an end
c34257	They looked,
c34258	but [there was] no one to save them—
c34259	to the LORD,
c34260	but He did not answer.
c34261	I ground them as the dust of the earth;
c34262	I crushed ... like mud in the streets.
c34263	and trampled them
c34264	You have delivered me from the strife of my people;
c34265	You have preserved me as the head of nations;
c34266	a people
c34267	I had not known
c34268	shall serve me.
c34269	Foreigners cower before me;
c34270	when they hear me,
c34271	they obey me.
c34272	Foreigners lose heart
c34273	and come trembling from their strongholds.
c34274	The LORD lives,
c34275	and blessed [be] my Rock!
c34276	And may God, the rock of my salvation, be exalted—
c34277	the God
c34278	who avenges me
c34279	and brings down nations beneath me,
c34280	who frees me from my enemies.
c34281	You exalt me above my foes;
c34282	You rescue me from violent men.
c34283	Therefore I will praise You,
c34284	O LORD,
c34285	among the nations;
c34286	I will sing praises to Your name.
c34287	Great salvation {He brings to} His king.
c34288	He shows loving devotion to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.”
c34289	These are the last words of David:
c34290	“The oracle of David son of Jesse, the oracle of the man
c34291	raised on high,
c34292	the one anointed by the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel:
c34293	The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me;
c34294	His word was on my tongue.
c34295	The God of Israel spoke;
c34296	the Rock of Israel said to me,
c34297	‘He who rules the people with justice,
c34298	who rules in the fear of God,
c34299	is like the light of the morning
c34300	at sunrise
c34301	dawn,
c34302	of a cloudless
c34303	the glistening after the rain on the sprouting grass of the earth.’
c34304	Is not my house right with God?
c34305	For He has established with me an everlasting covenant,
c34306	ordered ... in every part.
c34307	and secured
c34308	my full salvation and my every desire?
c34309	Will He not bring about
c34310	But the worthless
c34311	are all like thorns raked aside,
c34312	for they can never be gathered by hand.
c34313	The man [who] touches them
c34314	must be armed with iron or with the shaft of a spear.
c34315	The fire will burn them to ashes in [the] place [where they lie].”
c34316	These are the names ... mighty men:
c34317	of David’s
c34318	Josheb-basshebeth the Tahchemonite
c34319	was chief of the Three. He
c34320	wielded his spear
c34321	against eight hundred [men], whom he killed at one time.
c34322	Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty men,
c34323	he [went] with David
c34324	to taunt the Philistines
c34325	who had gathered for battle [at Pas-dammim].
c34326	The men of Israel retreated,
c34327	but Eleazar stood his ground
c34328	and struck the Philistines
c34329	until his hand grew weary
c34330	and stuck to his sword.
c34331	The LORD brought about a great victory that day.
c34332	Then the troops returned to him,
c34333	but only to plunder the dead.
c34334	And after him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite.
c34335	When the Philistines had banded together near
c34336	a field
c34337	full of lentils,
c34338	[Israel's] troops fled from [them].
c34339	But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field,
c34340	defended it,
c34341	and struck down the Philistines.
c34342	So the LORD brought about a great victory.
c34343	three of the thirty chief men went down
c34344	At harvest time, ... to David at the cave of Adullam,
c34345	while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
c34346	At that time David was in the stronghold,
c34347	and the garrison of the Philistines was at Bethlehem.
c34348	David longed [for water]
c34349	and said,
c34350	“Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well ... of Bethlehem!”
c34351	near the gate
c34352	So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine camp,
c34353	drew water from the well ... of Bethlehem,
c34354	near the gate
c34356	and brought [it] back to David.
c34357	But he refused
c34358	to drink it;
c34359	instead , he poured it out to the LORD,
c34360	saying,
c34361	“Far be it from me,
c34362	O LORD,
c34363	to do this!
c34364	Is [this not] the blood of the men
c34365	who risked their lives?”
c34366	So he refused
c34367	to drink it.
c34368	Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
c34369	Now Abishai, the brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah,
c34370	was chief of the Three,
c34371	and he lifted his spear against three hundred [men], killed [them],
c34372	and won a name along with [the] Three.
c34373	than the Three?
c34375	Was he not more honored
c34376	And he became their commander,
c34377	even though he was not included among the Three.
c34378	And Benaiah son of Jehoiada [was] a valiant warrior from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits.
c34379	[He] struck down two champions of Moab,
c34380	he went down
c34381	and on a snowy day ... into a pit and killed a lion.
c34382	He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man.
c34383	Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand,
c34384	Benaiah went against him with a club,
c34385	snatched the spear from [his] hand,
c34386	and killed [the Egyptian] with his own spear.
c34387	These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada,
c34388	who won a name alongside the three mighty men.
c34389	He was the most honored of the Thirty,
c34390	but he did not become one of the Three. ... him over
c34391	And David appointed ... his guard.
c34392	Now [these were members of] the Thirty: Asahel the brother of Joab,
c34393	Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
c34394	Shammah the Harodite,
c34395	Elika the Harodite,
c34396	Helez the Paltite,
c34397	Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
c34398	Abiezer the Anathothite,
c34399	Mebunnai the Hushathite,
c34400	Zalmon the Ahohite,
c34401	Maharai the Netophathite,
c34402	Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
c34403	Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjamites,
c34404	Benaiah the Pirathonite,
c34405	Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash,
c34406	Abi-albon the Arbathite,
c34407	Azmaveth the Barhumite,
c34408	Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
c34409	the sons of Jashen, Jonathan
c34410	son of Shammah the Hararite,
c34411	Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,
c34412	Eliphelet son of Ahasbai son of the Maacathite,
c34413	Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
c34414	Hezro the Carmelite,
c34415	Paarai the Arbite,
c34416	Igal son of Nathan of Zobah,
c34417	Bani the Gadite,
c34418	Zelek the Ammonite,
c34419	Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
c34420	Ira the Ithrite,
c34421	Gareb the Ithrite,
c34422	and Uriah the Hittite.
c34423	There were thirty-seven in all.
c34424	Again the anger of the LORD
c34425	burned against Israel,
c34426	and He stirred up David against them,
c34427	saying,
c34428	“Go,
c34429	take a census of Israel and Judah.”
c34430	So the king said to Joab the commander of his army,
c34431	who [was] with him,
c34432	“Go now throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba
c34433	and register the troops,
c34434	so that I may know their number.”
c34435	But Joab replied to the king,
c34436	“May the LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over
c34437	and may the eyes of my lord the king see [it].
c34438	does my lord the king
c34439	But why ... want to do such a thing?”
c34440	Nevertheless , the king's word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army.
c34441	So Joab and the commanders of the army departed from the presence of the king
c34442	to count the troops of Israel.
c34443	They crossed the Jordan
c34444	and camped near Aroer, south of the town
c34445	in the middle of the valley, and proceeded toward Gad
c34446	and Jazer.
c34447	Then they went to Gilead
c34448	and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi
c34449	and continued on to Dan-jaan
c34450	and around to Sidon.
c34451	They went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites.
c34452	Finally, they went on to the Negev of Judah, [to] Beersheba.
c34453	having gone through the whole land,
c34454	At the end of nine months and twenty days, ... they returned to Jerusalem.
c34455	And Joab reported to the king the total number of the troops.
c34456	In Israel there were 800,000 valiant warriors
c34457	who drew the sword,
c34458	and in Judah there were 500,000.
c34459	After ... [his] conscience was stricken
c34460	[David] had numbered the troops,
c34461	and he said to the LORD,
c34462	“I have sinned greatly
c34463	in what I have done.
c34464	Now,
c34465	O LORD,
c34466	I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant,
c34467	for I have acted very foolishly.”
c34468	When David got up in the morning,
c34469	a revelation from the LORD had come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer:
c34471	“Go
c34472	and tell David
c34473	that this is what the LORD says:
c34474	‘I am offering you three [options].
c34475	Choose one of them,
c34476	and I will carry it out against you.’”
c34477	So Gad went ... to David,
c34478	and said
c34480	“Shall you endure three years of famine on your land,
c34481	or three months of fleeing ... of your enemies,
c34482	the pursuit
c34483	or three days of plague upon your land?
c34484	Now then, think it over
c34485	and decide
c34486	how I should reply to Him who sent me.”
c34487	David answered Gad,
c34488	“I am deeply distressed.
c34489	Please, let us fall into the hands of the LORD,
c34490	for His mercies [are] great;
c34491	but do not let me fall into the hands of men.”
c34492	So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the appointed time,
c34493	and of the people from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand men died.
c34494	But when the angel stretched out his hand ... Jerusalem,
c34495	to destroy
c34496	the LORD relented from the calamity
c34497	and said to the angel
c34498	who was destroying the people,
c34499	“Enough, ... now!”
c34500	withdraw your hand
c34501	At that time the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
c34502	When David ... he said to the LORD,
c34503	saw the angel
c34504	striking down the people,
c34506	“Surely I, [the shepherd], have sinned
c34507	and acted wickedly.
c34508	But these sheep,
c34509	what have they done?
c34510	Please, let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house.”
c34511	And that day Gad came to David
c34512	and said to him,
c34513	“Go up
c34514	and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
c34515	So David went up at the word of Gad,
c34516	just as the LORD had commanded.
c34517	When Araunah looked out
c34518	and saw the king and his servants
c34519	coming toward him,
c34520	he went out
c34521	and bowed ... before the king.
c34522	facedown
c34523	Araunah said.
c34524	“Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”
c34525	David replied,
c34526	“To buy your threshing floor,”
c34527	“that I may build an altar to the LORD,
c34528	so that the plague on the people may be halted.”
c34529	Araunah said to David,
c34530	may take
c34531	“My lord the king ... and offer it up.
c34532	whatever [seems] good
c34533	Here are the oxen for a burnt offering
c34534	and the threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.
c34535	Araunah gives all these
c34536	O king,
c34537	to the king.”
c34538	[He] also said to the king,
c34539	“May the LORD your God accept you.”
c34540	replied the king,
c34541	“No,”
c34542	“I insist on paying a price,
c34543	for I will not offer to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”
c34544	So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
c34545	And there he built an altar to the LORD
c34546	and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
c34547	Then the LORD answered the prayers on behalf of the land,
c34548	and the plague on Israel was halted.
c34549	Now King David was old
c34550	and advanced in years,
c34551	and though they covered him with blankets,
c34552	he could not get warm.
c34553	So his servants said to him,
c34554	“Let us search for a young virgin for our lord the king,
c34555	to attend to [him]
c34556	and care for him
c34557	and lie by his side
c34558	{to keep} him warm.”
c34559	Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl,
c34560	and they found Abishag the Shunammite
c34561	and brought her to the king.
c34562	The girl was unsurpassed in beauty,
c34563	and she cared for the king
c34564	and served him,
c34565	but he had no relations with her.
c34566	At that time Adonijah, [David's] son by Haggith, began to exalt himself,
c34567	saying,
c34568	“I will be king!”
c34569	And he acquired chariots and horsemen and fifty men
c34570	to run ahead of him.
c34571	(His father had never once reprimanded
c34572	him by saying,
c34573	“Why do you act this way?”
c34574	He [was] also very handsome,
c34575	born next after Absalom.)
c34576	So [Adonijah] conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest,
c34577	who supported [him].
c34578	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, ... mighty men
c34579	and David’s
c34580	would not join Adonijah.
c34581	And Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened calves near the stone of Zoheleth,
c34582	which is next to En-rogel.
c34583	He invited all his royal brothers and all the men of Judah who were servants of the king.
c34584	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or his brother Solomon.
c34585	Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
c34587	“Have you not heard
c34588	that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king,
c34589	and our lord David does not know it?
c34590	Now ... come
c34591	please, ... and let me advise you.
c34592	Save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
c34593	Go
c34594	at once to King David
c34595	and say,
c34596	did you not
c34597	‘My lord the king,
c34598	swear to your maidservant,
c34600	“Surely your son Solomon will reign after me,
c34601	and he will sit on my throne”?
c34602	Why then has Adonijah become king?’
c34603	Then, while you are still there speaking with the king,
c34604	I will come in after you
c34605	and confirm your words.”
c34606	So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom.
c34607	Since the king was very old,
c34608	Abishag the Shunammite was serving him.
c34609	And Bathsheba bowed down
c34610	in homage to the king,
c34611	[who] asked,
c34612	“What is your desire?”
c34613	she replied,
c34614	“My lord,”
c34615	“you yourself swore to your maidservant by the LORD your God:
c34616	‘Surely your son Solomon will reign after me,
c34617	and he will sit on my throne.’
c34618	But now,
c34619	behold, Adonijah has become king,
c34620	and you,
c34621	my lord the king,
c34622	did not know it.
c34623	And he has sacrificed an abundance of oxen, fattened calves, and sheep,
c34624	and has invited all the other sons of the king, as well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army.
c34625	But he did not invite your servant Solomon.
c34626	And as for you,
c34627	my lord the king,
c34628	the eyes of all Israel [are] upon you
c34629	to tell them
c34630	who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
c34631	will be counted
c34632	Otherwise, when my lord the king rests with his fathers,
c34633	I and my son Solomon ... as criminals.”
c34634	And just then,
c34635	while [Bathsheba] was still speaking with the king,
c34636	Nathan the prophet arrived.
c34637	So the king was told,
c34639	“Nathan the prophet is here.”
c34640	And [Nathan] went before the king
c34641	and bowed facedown to [him].
c34642	said Nathan,
c34643	“My lord the king,”
c34644	“did you say,
c34645	‘Adonijah will reign after me,
c34646	and he will sit on my throne’?
c34647	For today he has gone down
c34648	and sacrificed an abundance of oxen, fattened calves, and sheep,
c34649	and has invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest.
c34650	And behold, they are eating
c34651	and drinking before him,
c34652	saying,
c34653	‘Long live King Adonijah!’
c34654	But me your servant he did not invite, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon.
c34655	Has my lord the king let this happen
c34656	without informing your servant
c34657	who should sit on the throne after my lord the king?”
c34658	Then King David said,
c34660	“Call in Bathsheba for me.”
c34661	So she came into the king’s presence
c34662	and stood before him.
c34663	And the king swore an oath,
c34664	saying,
c34665	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c34666	who has redeemed my life from all distress,
c34667	exactly
c34668	what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel:
c34670	Surely your son Solomon will reign after me,
c34671	and he will sit on my throne in my place.”
c34672	I will carry out this very day
c34673	Bathsheba bowed
c34674	facedown
c34675	in homage to the king
c34676	and said,
c34677	“May my lord King David live forever!”
c34678	Then King David said,
c34679	“Call in for me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.”
c34680	So they came before the king.
c34681	said the king.
c34682	“Take my servants with you,”
c34683	“Set my son Solomon on my own mule
c34685	and take him down to Gihon.
c34686	There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him king over Israel.
c34687	You are to blow the trumpet
c34688	and declare,
c34689	‘Long live King Solomon!’
c34690	Then you shall go up with him,
c34691	and he is to come
c34692	and sit on my throne
c34693	and reign in my place.
c34694	For I have appointed him
c34695	to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”
c34696	replied Benaiah son of Jehoiada.
c34697	declare it.
c34698	“Amen,”
c34699	“May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so
c34700	Just as the LORD was with my lord the king,
c34701	so may He be with Solomon
c34702	and make his throne even greater than [that] of my lord King David.”
c34703	Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, along with the Cherethites and Pelethites, went down
c34704	and set Solomon on King David’s mule,
c34705	and they escorted him to Gihon.
c34706	Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tabernacle
c34707	and anointed Solomon.
c34708	Then they blew the trumpet,
c34709	and all the people proclaimed,
c34710	“Long live King Solomon!”
c34711	All the people followed him,
c34712	playing flutes
c34713	and rejoicing with such a great joy
c34714	that the earth was split by the sound.
c34715	Now Adonijah and all his guests ... when they heard
c34717	were finishing
c34718	their feast
c34719	the sound of the trumpet. ... Joab.
c34720	asked
c34721	“Why [is] the city in such a loud uproar?”
c34722	As he was speaking,
c34723	suddenly Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest arrived.
c34724	said Adonijah,
c34725	“Come in,”
c34726	“for you [are] a man of valor.
c34727	You must be bringing good news.”
c34728	Jonathan replied.
c34730	“Not at all,”
c34731	“Our lord King David has made Solomon king.
c34732	And with Solomon, the king has sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, along with Cherethites, and Pelethites,
c34733	and they have set him on the king’s mule.
c34734	Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon,
c34735	and they have gone up from there with rejoicing
c34736	that rings out in the city.
c34737	That is the noise
c34738	you hear.
c34739	Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.
c34740	The king’s servants have also gone
c34741	to congratulate our lord King David,
c34742	saying,
c34743	‘May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than your own name,
c34744	and may He make his throne greater than your throne.’
c34745	And the king has bowed in worship on his bed,
c34746	saying,
c34747	‘May the LORD God of Israel be praised!
c34748	Today He has provided [one]
c34749	to sit on my throne,
c34750	and my eyes have seen [it].’”
c34751	in terror
c34752	At this, all the guests ... arose
c34753	of Adonijah
c34754	and scattered.
c34756	But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon,
c34757	got up
c34758	and went
c34759	to take hold of the horns of the altar.
c34760	It was reported to Solomon:
c34761	saying,
c34762	“Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon,
c34763	and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar,
c34765	‘Let King Solomon first swear to me
c34766	not to put his servant to the sword.’”
c34767	And Solomon replied,
c34768	“If he is a man of character,
c34769	not a single hair of his will fall to the ground.
c34770	But if evil is found in him,
c34771	he will die.”
c34772	So King Solomon summoned [Adonijah]
c34773	down from the altar,
c34774	and he came
c34775	and bowed down before King Solomon,
c34776	[who] said to him,
c34777	“Go to your home.”
c34778	As the time drew near for David
c34779	to die,
c34780	he charged his son Solomon,
c34782	“I am about to go the way of all of the earth.
c34783	So be strong
c34784	and prove yourself a man.
c34785	And keep the charge of the LORD your God
c34786	to walk in His ways
c34787	and to keep His statutes, commandments, ordinances, and decrees,
c34788	as is written in the law of Moses,
c34789	so that you may prosper in all
c34790	you do
c34791	and wherever
c34792	you turn,
c34793	and so that the LORD may fulfill His promise
c34794	to me:
c34796	‘If your descendants take heed
c34797	to walk in truth before Me with all their heart and soul,
c34799	you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’
c34800	Moreover, you know
c34801	what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me
c34802	[and] what he did to Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether, the two commanders of the armies of Israel.
c34803	He killed them
c34804	in peacetime to avenge the blood of war.
c34805	He stained with the blood of war the belt
c34806	around his waist
c34807	and the sandals
c34808	on his feet.
c34809	So act according to your wisdom,
c34810	and do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.
c34811	But show loving devotion to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
c34812	and let them be among those who eat at your table,
c34813	because they stood by me
c34814	when I fled from your brother Absalom.
c34815	Keep an eye on Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite with you from Bahurim
c34816	[who] called down bitter curses against me on the day
c34817	I went to Mahanaim.
c34818	But he came down
c34819	to meet me
c34820	at the Jordan,
c34821	and I swore to him by the LORD:
c34823	‘I will never kill you with the sword.’
c34824	Now therefore,
c34825	do not hold him guiltless,
c34826	for you are a wise man.
c34827	You know
c34828	what you ought to do to him
c34829	to bring his gray head down to Sheol in blood.”
c34830	Then David rested with his fathers
c34831	and was buried in the City of David.
c34832	The length
c34833	of David's reign over Israel
c34834	[was] forty years—
c34835	seven years in Hebron
c34836	and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
c34837	So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David,
c34838	and his kingdom was firmly established.
c34839	Now Adonijah son of Haggith went to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
c34840	who asked,
c34841	in peace?”
c34842	“Do you come
c34843	he replied.
c34844	“Yes, in peace,”
c34845	Then he said,
c34846	“I have something [to tell] you.”
c34847	she answered.
c34848	“Say it,”
c34849	he said.
c34850	“You know
c34851	that the kingship was mine,”
c34852	“All Israel expected
c34853	that I should reign,
c34854	but the kingship has turned
c34855	to my brother, ... to him
c34856	for it has come ... from the LORD.
c34857	So now
c34858	I have just one request of you;
c34859	do not deny me.”
c34860	she told him.
c34861	“State [your request],”
c34862	[Adonijah] replied,
c34863	“Please speak to King Solomon,
c34864	since he will not turn you down.
c34865	Let him give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.”
c34866	Bathsheba replied.
c34867	“Very well,”
c34868	“I will speak to the king for you.”
c34869	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon
c34870	to speak to him for Adonijah.
c34871	The king stood up
c34872	to greet her,
c34873	bowed to her,
c34874	and sat down on his throne.
c34875	Then [the king] had a throne brought for [his] mother,
c34876	[who] sat down at his right hand.
c34877	she said.
c34878	“I have just one small request of you,” ... “Make your request,
c34879	“Do not deny me.”
c34880	the king replied,
c34882	my mother,”
c34883	“for I will not deny you.”
c34884	So [Bathsheba] said,
c34885	“Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife.”
c34886	King Solomon answered
c34887	his mother,
c34888	“Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?
c34889	you might as well request the kingdom for him
c34890	Since he ... brother,
c34891	is my older
c34892	and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab son of Zeruiah.”
c34893	Then King Solomon swore by the LORD:
c34895	“May God punish me,
c34896	and ever so severely,
c34897	if Adonijah has not made this request at the expense of his life.
c34898	And now,
c34899	as surely as the LORD lives—
c34900	the One who established me,
c34901	who set me on the throne of my father David,
c34902	and who founded for me a dynasty as
c34903	He promised—
c34904	surely Adonijah shall be put to death today!”
c34905	So King Solomon sent the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada,
c34906	who struck down Adonijah,
c34907	and he died.
c34908	Then the king said to Abiathar the priest,
c34909	“Go back to your fields in Anathoth.
c34910	Even though you deserve to die,
c34911	I will not put you to death at this time,
c34912	since you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David,
c34913	and you suffered through all
c34914	that my father suffered.”
c34915	So Solomon banished Abiathar
c34916	from the priesthood of the LORD
c34917	and so fulfilled the word the LORD
c34918	had spoken at Shiloh against the house of Eli.
c34919	When the news reached Joab,
c34920	[who] had conspired with Adonijah
c34921	but not with Absalom,
c34922	[he] fled to the tent of the LORD
c34923	and took hold of the horns of the altar.
c34924	It was reported to King Solomon:
c34925	“Joab has fled to the tent of the LORD
c34926	and is now beside the altar.”
c34927	So Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada,
c34928	saying,
c34929	“Go,
c34930	strike him down!”
c34931	And Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD
c34932	and said to Joab,
c34933	“vvv The king says,
c34934	‘Come out!’”
c34935	But Joab replied,
c34936	“No,
c34937	I will die here.”
c34938	So Benaiah relayed the message to the king,
c34939	saying,
c34940	“This is how Joab
c34941	answered me.”
c34942	And the king replied,
c34943	“Do
c34944	just as he says.
c34945	Strike him down
c34946	and bury him,
c34947	and so remove ... the innocent blood
c34948	that Joab shed.
c34949	from me and from the house of my father
c34950	The LORD will bring his bloodshed back upon his own head,
c34951	for ... he struck down two men
c34952	more righteous and better than he
c34953	when he killed with the sword
c34954	without the knowledge of my father David
c34955	Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army.
c34956	Their blood will come back upon the heads of Joab [and] his descendants forever;
c34957	but for David, his descendants, his house, and his throne, there shall be peace from the LORD forever.”
c34958	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up,
c34959	struck down Joab,
c34960	and killed him.
c34961	He was buried at his own home in the wilderness.
c34962	And the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab’s place over the army,
c34963	and he appointed Zadok the priest in Abiathar’s place.
c34964	Then the king summoned
c34965	Shimei
c34966	and said to him,
c34967	“Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem
c34968	and live there,
c34969	but do not go anywhere else.
c34970	will be
c34971	On the day
c34972	you go out
c34973	and cross the Kidron Valley,
c34974	know for sure
c34975	that you will die;
c34976	your blood ... on your own head.”
c34977	Shimei replied.
c34978	“The sentence is fair,”
c34979	as my lord the king has spoken.”
c34980	“Your servant will do
c34981	And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
c34982	After three years, however,
c34983	two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath.
c34984	And Shimei was told,
c34986	“Behold, your slaves are in Gath.”
c34987	So Shimei
c34988	saddled his donkey
c34989	and set out to Achish at Gath
c34990	in search of his slaves,
c34992	and he brought them back from Gath.
c34993	When it was reported to Solomon
c34994	that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath
c34995	and had returned,
c34996	the king summoned
c34997	Shimei
c34998	and said to him,
c34999	“Did I not make you swear by the LORD
c35000	and warn you,
c35002	‘On the day
c35003	you leave
c35004	and go elsewhere,
c35005	know for sure
c35006	that you will die’?
c35007	And you told me,
c35008	‘The sentence is fair;
c35009	I will comply.’
c35010	So why have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the command
c35011	that I gave you?”
c35012	The king also said,
c35013	“You know ... all the evil
c35014	in your heart ... that
c35015	you did to my father David.
c35016	Therefore the LORD will bring your evil back upon your head.
c35017	But King Solomon will be blessed
c35018	and David’s throne will remain secure before the LORD forever.”
c35019	Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada,
c35020	and he went out
c35021	and struck Shimei down,
c35022	and he died.
c35023	Thus the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Solomon.
c35024	Later, Solomon formed an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt
c35025	by marrying [his] daughter.
c35026	Solomon brought her to the City of David
c35027	until he finished
c35028	building his palace and the house of the LORD, as well as the wall around Jerusalem.
c35029	The people, however, were still sacrificing on the high places
c35030	because a house for the Name of the LORD had not yet been built.
c35031	And Solomon loved the LORD,
c35032	walking in the statutes of his father David—
c35033	except that he sacrificed ... on the high places.
c35034	and burned incense
c35035	Now the king went to Gibeon
c35036	to sacrifice there,
c35037	for it [was] the great high place.
c35038	Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on the altar [there].
c35039	One night at Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream,
c35040	and God said,
c35041	“Ask,
c35042	[and] I will give it to you!”
c35043	Solomon replied,
c35044	“You have shown great loving devotion to Your servant, my father David,
c35045	because he walked before You in truth, righteousness, and uprightness of heart.
c35046	And You have kept this great loving devotion
c35047	by giving him a son
c35048	to sit on his throne
c35049	this very day.
c35050	And now,
c35051	O LORD my God,
c35052	You {have made} Your servant king in my father David’s place.
c35053	But I [am] only a little child,
c35054	not knowing [how]
c35055	to exit
c35056	or enter.
c35057	Your servant is here among the people
c35058	You have chosen,
c35059	a people
c35060	to count
c35061	too numerous ... or number.
c35062	Therefore give Your servant an understanding heart
c35063	to judge Your people
c35064	and to discern between good and evil.
c35065	For who is able
c35066	to govern this great people of Yours?”
c35067	Now it pleased the Lord
c35068	that Solomon had made this request.
c35069	So God said to him,
c35070	“Since you have asked for this
c35071	instead of requesting long life
c35072	[or] wealth for yourself ... but you have asked
c35073	[or] death for your enemies—
c35075	for discernment
c35076	to administer justice—
c35077	behold, I will do what you have asked.
c35078	I will give you a wise and discerning heart,
c35079	so that there will never have been anyone like you,
c35080	[nor] will there ever be.
c35082	Moreover, ... you what you did not request—
c35083	I will give ... both riches and honor—
c35084	so that during all your days no man in any kingdom will be your equal.
c35085	So if you walk in My ways
c35086	and keep My statutes and commandments,
c35087	just as your father David did,
c35088	then I will prolong your days.”
c35089	Then Solomon awoke,
c35090	and indeed it had been a dream.
c35091	So he returned to Jerusalem,
c35092	stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
c35093	and offered burnt offerings
c35094	and peace offerings. Then he held
c35095	a feast for all his servants.
c35096	At that time two prostitutes came to the king
c35097	and stood before him.
c35098	One woman said,
c35099	“Please, my lord,
c35100	this woman and I live in the same house,
c35101	and I gave birth while she [was] in the house.
c35102	On the third day
c35103	after I gave birth,
c35104	this woman also had a baby.
c35105	We were alone,
c35106	with no one in the house
c35107	but the two of us.
c35108	During the night this woman’s son died
c35109	because she rolled over on him.
c35110	So she got up in the middle of the night
c35111	and took my son from my side
c35112	while I was asleep.
c35113	She laid him in her bosom
c35114	and put her dead son at my bosom.
c35115	The next morning, when I got up
c35116	to nurse my son,
c35117	I discovered
c35118	he was dead.
c35119	But when I examined him,
c35120	I realized
c35121	that he was not the son
c35122	I had borne.”
c35123	said the other woman,
c35124	“No,”
c35125	“the living one [is] my son
c35126	and the dead one [is] your son.”
c35127	But the first woman insisted,
c35128	“No,
c35129	the dead one [is] yours
c35130	and the living one [is] mine.”
c35131	So they argued before the king.
c35132	Then the king replied,
c35133	“This woman says,
c35134	‘My son is alive
c35135	and yours is dead,’
c35136	but that woman says,
c35137	‘No,
c35138	your son is dead
c35139	and mine is alive.’”
c35140	The king continued,
c35141	“Bring me a sword.”
c35142	So they brought him a sword,
c35143	and the king declared,
c35144	“Cut the living child in two
c35145	and give half to one
c35146	and half to the other.”
c35147	Then the woman ... spoke
c35148	whose son was alive
c35149	to the king
c35150	because she yearned with compassion for her son.
c35151	she said,
c35152	“My lord,” ... Please
c35153	“give her the living baby.
c35154	do not kill him!”
c35155	But the other [woman] said,
c35156	mine
c35157	or yours.
c35158	“He will not be
c35159	Cut him in two!”
c35160	Then the king
c35161	gave his ruling:
c35162	“Give the living baby to the first woman.
c35163	By no means should you kill him;
c35164	she is his mother.”
c35165	When all Israel heard of the judgment
c35166	the king had given,
c35167	they stood in awe of [him],
c35168	for they saw
c35169	that the wisdom of God [was] in him
c35170	to administer justice.
c35171	So King Solomon ruled over Israel,
c35172	and these were his chief officials:
c35174	Azariah son of Zadok [was] the priest;
c35175	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, [were] secretaries;
c35176	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud [was] the recorder;
c35177	Benaiah son of Jehoiada [was] in charge of the army;
c35178	Zadok and Abiathar [were] priests;
c35179	Azariah son of Nathan [was] in charge of the governors;
c35180	Zabud son of Nathan [was] a priest and adviser to the king;
c35181	Ahishar [was] in charge of the palace;
c35182	and Adoniram son of Abda [was] in charge of the labor force.
c35183	Solomon had twelve
c35184	governors over all Israel
c35185	to provide food for the king and his household.
c35186	[Each] one ... for one month of the year,
c35187	would arrange provisions
c35188	and these were their names:
c35189	Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
c35190	Ben-deker in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
c35191	Ben-hesed in Arubboth
c35192	(Socoh and all the land of Hepher belonged to him);
c35193	Ben-abinadab in Naphath-dor
c35194	(Taphath, a daughter of Solomon, was his wife);
c35195	Baana son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all of Beth-shean
c35196	next to Zarethan
c35197	below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah and on past Jokmeam;
c35198	Ben-geber in Ramoth-gilead ... in Gilead
c35199	(the villages of Jair son of Manasseh ... [belonged] to him,
c35201	as well as the region of Argob
c35202	in Bashan
c35203	with its sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);
c35204	Ahinadab son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
c35205	Ahimaaz in Naphtali
c35206	(he had married Basemath, a daughter of Solomon);
c35207	Baana son of Hushai in Asher and in Aloth;
c35208	Jehoshaphat son of Paruah in Issachar;
c35209	Shimei son of Ela in Benjamin;
c35210	Geber son of Uri in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan.
c35211	He was the only governor
c35212	in the land [of Judah].
c35213	Judah and Israel ... as the sand
c35214	by the sea,
c35215	[became] as numerous
c35216	eating
c35217	and drinking
c35218	and rejoicing.
c35219	And Solomon
c35220	reigned over all the kingdoms from the [Euphrates] to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.
c35221	[These kingdoms] offered tribute
c35222	and served Solomon all the days of his life.
c35223	Solomon’s provisions for a single day were thirty cors of fine flour, sixty cors of meal,
c35224	ten fat oxen, twenty range oxen, and a hundred sheep, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened poultry.
c35225	For [Solomon] had dominion over everything west of the Euphrates— over all the kingdoms from Tiphsah to Gaza—
c35226	and he had peace on all sides.
c35227	Judah and Israel lived in safety
c35228	each man under his own vine and his own fig tree.
c35229	Throughout the days of Solomon, ... from Dan to Beersheba,
c35230	Solomon had four thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand horses.
c35231	the governors in turn provided food for King Solomon and all
c35232	who came to [his] table.
c35233	Each month
c35234	They saw to it that nothing was lacking.
c35235	also brought to the required place ... of barley and straw for the chariot horses and other horses.
c35237	Each one ... their quotas
c35238	And God gave Solomon wisdom,
c35239	exceedingly deep insight, and understanding beyond measure, like the sand
c35240	on the seashore.
c35241	Solomon’s wisdom was greater than [that] of all the men of the East, greater than all the wisdom of Egypt.
c35242	He was wiser than all men— wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and wiser than Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol.
c35243	And his fame spread throughout the surrounding nations.
c35244	Solomon composed three thousand proverbs,
c35245	and his songs numbered a thousand and five.
c35246	He spoke of trees, from the cedar ... about
c35247	in Lebanon
c35248	to the hyssop
c35249	growing in the wall,
c35250	and he taught ... animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.
c35251	So men of all nations came
c35252	to Solomon’s ... when they heard of his wisdom.
c35253	sent by all the kings of the earth
c35254	to listen ... wisdom,
c35255	Now when Hiram king of Tyre ... he sent envoys to Solomon;
c35256	heard
c35257	that [Solomon] had been anointed king in his father’s place,
c35258	for ... friends
c35259	Hiram ... been
c35260	had always ... with David.
c35261	And Solomon relayed ... to Hiram:
c35262	this message
c35263	“As you are aware, ... against my father David,
c35264	he could not
c35265	because of the wars waged ... build a house for the Name of the LORD his God
c35266	on all sides
c35267	until the LORD had put his enemies under his feet.
c35268	But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side,
c35269	and there is no adversary
c35270	or crisis.
c35271	So behold, I plan
c35272	to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God,
c35273	according to what the LORD said to my father David:
c35275	your son
c35276	‘I will put ... on your throne in your place,
c35277	and he will build the house for My Name.’
c35278	Now therefore,
c35279	order
c35280	that cedars of Lebanon be cut down for me.
c35281	My servants will be with your servants,
c35282	and I will pay your servants whatever wages
c35283	you set,
c35284	for you know
c35285	that [there are] none among us
c35286	as skilled
c35287	in logging
c35288	as the Sidonians.”
c35290	When Hiram received Solomon’s message,
c35291	he rejoiced greatly
c35292	and said,
c35293	“Blessed [be] the LORD this day!
c35294	He has given David a wise son over this great people!”
c35295	Then Hiram sent a reply to Solomon,
c35296	saying:
c35297	“I have received
c35298	your message;
c35299	I will do all you desire regarding the cedar and cypress timber.
c35300	My servants will haul the logs from Lebanon to the sea,
c35301	and I will float them in rafts by sea to the place
c35302	you specify.
c35303	There I will separate [the logs],
c35304	and you can take them away.
c35305	And in exchange, you can meet my needs
c35306	by providing my household with food.”
c35307	So
c35308	Hiram provided Solomon with all the cedar and cypress timber he wanted,
c35309	Solomon would provide Hiram with twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household,
c35310	as well as twenty [thousand] baths of pure olive oil.
c35311	and year after year
c35312	And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom,
c35313	as He had promised him.
c35314	There was peace between Hiram and Solomon,
c35315	and the two of them made a treaty.
c35316	Then King Solomon conscripted a labor force ... from all Israel.
c35317	of thirty thousand men
c35318	He sent them to Lebanon
c35319	in monthly shifts of ten thousand,
c35320	so that they would spend one month in Lebanon
c35321	[and] two months at home.
c35322	And Adoniram [was] in charge of the labor force.
c35323	Solomon had 70,000
c35324	porters
c35325	and80,000
c35326	stonecutters in the mountains,
c35327	not including his ... foremen
c35329	3,300
c35330	who supervised the workers.
c35332	And the king commanded them
c35333	to quarry large, costly stones ... stones.
c35334	to lay the foundation of the temple
c35335	with dressed
c35336	So Solomon’s and Hiram’s builders, along with the Gebalites, quarried the stone
c35337	and prepared the timber and stone
c35338	for the construction of the temple.
c35339	In the four hundred and eightieth year ... year
c35340	after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt,
c35341	of Ziv, ... month of the fourth
c35342	in the month ... the second
c35343	of [Solomon's] reign over Israel, [he]
c35344	began to build the house of the LORD.
c35345	The house
c35346	that King Solomon built for the LORD
c35347	[was] sixty cubits long,
c35348	twenty [cubits] wide,
c35349	and thirty cubits high.
c35350	The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple
c35351	[was] twenty cubits long, extending across the width of the temple
c35352	and projecting out ten cubits in front of the temple.
c35353	He also had narrow windows framed high in the temple.
c35354	Against the walls of the temple ... [Solomon] built a chambered structure all around
c35355	and the inner sanctuary, ... the temple, in which
c35356	he constructed the side rooms.
c35357	The bottom floor [was]
c35358	five cubits wide,
c35359	the middle floor
c35360	six cubits,
c35361	and the third [floor]
c35362	seven cubits.
c35363	He also placed offset ledges all around the outside of the temple,
c35364	so that nothing would be inserted into [its] walls.
c35365	The temple
c35366	was constructed
c35367	using finished stones cut at the quarry,
c35368	so that no hammer, chisel, or any iron tool was heard in the temple
c35369	while it was being built.
c35370	The entrance to the bottom floor was on the south side of the temple.
c35371	A stairway led up to the middle level,
c35372	and from [there] to the third floor.
c35373	So [Solomon] built the temple
c35374	and finished it,
c35375	roofing it with beams and planks of cedar.
c35376	He built chambers all along the temple,
c35377	[each] five cubits high
c35378	and attached to the temple with beams of cedar.
c35379	Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon,
c35380	saying:
c35381	“As for this temple
c35382	you are building,
c35383	if ... My statutes, ... by walking in them,
c35384	carry out My ordinances,
c35385	and keep all My commandments
c35386	you walk in
c35387	I will fulfill through you the promise
c35388	I made to your father David.
c35389	And I will dwell among the Israelites
c35390	and will not abandon My people Israel.”
c35391	So Solomon built the temple ... it.
c35392	and finished
c35393	He lined the interior walls with cedar paneling
c35394	from the floor of the temple to the ceiling,
c35395	and he covered the floor with cypress boards.
c35396	He partitioned off the twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling
c35397	to form within [the temple] and inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.
c35398	was forty cubits [long].
c35399	And the main hall in front of [this room]
c35400	The cedar paneling inside the temple
c35401	was carved with gourds and open flowers.
c35402	Everything was cedar;
c35403	not a stone could be seen.
c35404	[Solomon] also prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple
c35405	to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there.
c35406	The inner sanctuary
c35407	[was] twenty cubits long,
c35408	twenty cubits wide,
c35409	and twenty cubits high.
c35410	He overlaid [the inside] with pure gold,
c35411	and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.
c35412	So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold,
c35413	and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary,
c35414	which was overlaid with gold.
c35415	So he overlaid with gold the whole interior of the temple,
c35416	until everything was completely finished.
c35417	the entire altar
c35418	that belonged to the inner sanctuary.
c35419	He also overlaid with gold
c35420	In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim, ... out of olive wood.
c35421	[each] ten cubits high,
c35422	One wing of the first cherub [was] five cubits long,
c35423	and the other wing five cubits [as well].
c35424	So the full wingspan [was] ten cubits.
c35425	The second cherub [also measured] ten cubits;
c35426	both cherubim had the same size and shape,
c35427	and the height of each ... [was] ten cubits.
c35428	cherub
c35429	And he placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple.
c35430	Since their wings were spread out,
c35431	the wing of the first [cherub] touched one wall,
c35432	while the wing of the second cherub touched the other wall,
c35433	and in the middle of the room their wingtips touched.
c35434	He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
c35435	Then he carved the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer sanctuaries, with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.
c35436	And he overlaid the temple floor with gold in both the inner and outer sanctuaries.
c35437	For the entrance of the inner sanctuary, [Solomon] constructed doors of olive wood
c35438	with five-sided doorposts.
c35439	The double doors were made of olive wood,
c35440	and he carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers
c35441	and overlaid ... with hammered gold.
c35442	the cherubim and palm trees
c35443	In the same way, he made four-sided doorposts of olive wood for the sanctuary entrance.
c35444	The two doors were made of cypress wood,
c35445	[and] each had two folding panels.
c35447	And he carved [into them] cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers
c35448	and overlaid them with gold
c35449	hammered evenly over the carvings.
c35450	[Solomon] built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stone and one row of trimmed cedar beams.
c35451	The foundation of the house of the LORD was laid in the fourth year [of Solomon's reign], in the month of Ziv.
c35452	In his eleventh year ... the month of Bul,
c35453	and eighth month,
c35454	the temple was finished in every detail and according to every specification.
c35455	So he built [the temple] in seven years.
c35456	Solomon, however, took thirteen years ... the construction ... palace.
c35457	to complete ... of his entire
c35458	He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon
c35459	a hundred cubits long,
c35460	fifty cubits wide,
c35461	and thirty cubits high,
c35462	with four rows of cedar pillars
c35463	supporting the cedar beams.
c35464	[The house] was roofed with cedar above the beams
c35465	that rested on the pillars—
c35466	forty-five [beams],
c35467	fifteen per row.
c35468	There were three rows of [high] windows
c35469	facing each other in three tiers.
c35470	All the doorways had rectangular frames, with the openings facing each other [in] tiers of three.
c35471	[Solomon] made his colonnade
c35472	fifty cubits long
c35473	and thirty cubits wide,
c35474	with a portico in front of it
c35475	and a canopy with pillars in front of [the portico].
c35476	a hall for the throne,
c35477	where he was to judge.
c35478	In addition, he built ... the Hall of Justice,
c35479	It was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling.
c35480	And the palace
c35481	where [Solomon] would live,
c35482	set further back,
c35483	was of similar construction.
c35484	He also made a palace ... for Pharaoh’s daughter,
c35485	whom [he] had married.
c35486	like this hall
c35487	All these [buildings] were constructed with costly stones, cut to size
c35488	and trimmed with saws
c35489	inside and out from the foundation to the eaves, from the outside to the great courtyard.
c35490	The foundations were [laid with] large, costly stones, some eight cubits and some ten cubits [in length].
c35491	Above these were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams.
c35492	The great courtyard was surrounded by three rows of dressed stone
c35493	and a row of trimmed cedar beams,
c35494	as were the inner courtyard and portico of the house of the LORD.
c35495	Now King Solomon sent
c35496	to bring Huram from Tyre.
c35497	He [was] the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali,
c35498	and his father was a man of Tyre,
c35499	a craftsman in bronze.
c35500	Huram had great skill, understanding, and knowledge
c35501	for every kind of bronze work.
c35502	So he came to King Solomon
c35503	and carried out all his work.
c35504	He cast two pillars of bronze,
c35505	each eighteen cubits high
c35506	and twelve cubits in circumference.
c35507	He also made two capitals
c35508	to set on top of the pillars,
c35509	of cast bronze
c35510	[each] capital five cubits high.
c35512	[he made] a network of lattice,
c35513	For the capitals ... with wreaths of chainwork,
c35514	on top of the pillars
c35515	seven for [each] capital.
c35517	Likewise, he made the pillars with two rows ... around [each] grating
c35518	to cover each capital
c35519	of pomegranates ... atop [the pillars].
c35521	And the capitals
c35522	atop the pillars
c35523	in the portico were shaped like lilies, four cubits [high].
c35524	On the capitals of both pillars, just above the rounded projection
c35525	next to the network,
c35526	[were] the two hundred pomegranates in rows encircling each capital.
c35527	Thus he set up the pillars at the portico of the temple.
c35528	The pillar to the south
c35529	he named Jachin,
c35530	and the pillar to the north
c35531	he named Boaz.
c35532	And the tops of the pillars were shaped like lilies.
c35533	So the work of the pillars was completed.
c35534	He also made the Sea
c35535	of cast metal.
c35536	measuring ten cubits from rim to [rim],
c35537	[It was] circular in shape,
c35538	five cubits in height,
c35539	and thirty cubits in circumference.
c35540	Below the rim, ornamental buds encircled it,
c35541	ten per cubit
c35542	all the way around the Sea,
c35543	cast in two rows as a part of [the Sea].
c35544	[The Sea] stood on twelve oxen,
c35545	three facing north,
c35546	three facing west,
c35547	three facing south,
c35548	and three facing east.
c35549	[The Sea] rested on them,
c35550	with all their hindquarters toward the center.
c35551	It was a handbreadth thick,
c35552	and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom.
c35553	It could hold two thousand baths.
c35554	In addition, he made ten movable stands of bronze,
c35555	each four cubits long,
c35556	four cubits wide,
c35557	and three cubits high.
c35558	This was the design of the stands:
c35559	They had side panels
c35560	attached to uprights,
c35561	and on the panels
c35562	between the uprights
c35563	were lions, oxen, and cherubim.
c35564	On the uprights was a pedestal above,
c35565	and below the lions and oxen were wreaths of beveled work.
c35566	Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles
c35567	four
c35568	supports,
c35569	and a basin resting on
c35570	with wreaths at each side.
c35571	The opening [to each stand] inside the crown at the top [was] one cubit [deep],
c35572	with a round opening
c35573	like the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half [wide].
c35574	And around its opening [were] engravings, but the panels [of the stands] were
c35575	square,
c35576	not round.
c35577	There were four wheels under the panels,
c35578	and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand;
c35579	each wheel [was] a cubit and a half in diameter.
c35580	The wheels were made like chariot wheels;
c35581	their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs
c35582	were all of cast metal.
c35583	Each stand had four handles, [one for each] corner,
c35584	projecting from the stand.
c35585	At the top of each stand
c35586	half a cubit high.
c35587	[was] a circular band
c35588	The supports and panels were cast as a unit with the top of the stand.
c35589	He engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and panels, wherever each had space,
c35590	with wreaths all around.
c35591	In this way he made the ten stands,
c35592	each with the same casting, dimensions, and shape.
c35593	He also made ten bronze basins,
c35594	each holding forty baths
c35595	measuring four cubits across, ... basin for each
c35596	and ... one ... of the ten stands.
c35597	He set ... stands
c35598	five ... on the south side of the temple
c35599	and five on the north,
c35600	and he put the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple.
c35601	In addition, Huram made the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls.
c35602	So Huram finished
c35603	all the work he had undertaken
c35604	for King Solomon [in] the house of the LORD:
c35605	the two pillars; ... bowl-shaped capitals
c35606	the two ... atop the pillars;
c35607	the two sets of network
c35608	covering both bowls of the capitals
c35609	atop the pillars;
c35610	the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network
c35611	(two rows of pomegranates for each network
c35612	covering both the bowl-shaped capitals
c35613	atop the pillars);
c35614	the ten stands; the ten basins on the stands;
c35615	the Sea; the twelve oxen underneath the Sea;
c35616	and the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls.
c35617	All the articles
c35618	that Huram made for King Solomon [in] the house of the LORD
c35619	were made of burnished bronze.
c35620	The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.
c35621	Solomon {left} all these articles unweighed, because there were so many.
c35622	The weight of the bronze could not be determined.
c35623	Solomon also made all the furnishings
c35624	for the house of the LORD: ... on which
c35625	the golden altar; ... table
c35626	was placed the Bread of the Presence;
c35627	the golden
c35628	the lampstands
c35629	five on the right [side]
c35630	in front of the inner sanctuary, ... and five on the left;
c35631	of pure gold
c35632	the gold flowers, lamps, and tongs;
c35633	the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, ladles, and censers;
c35634	and the gold hinges for the doors of the inner temple (that is, the Most Holy Place) as well as for the doors of the main hall of the temple.
c35635	So all the work ... was completed.
c35636	that King Solomon had performed for the house of the LORD
c35637	Then Solomon brought in the consecrated items of his father David—
c35638	the silver, the gold, and the furnishings— and he placed them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
c35639	At that time Solomon assembled before him in Jerusalem the elders of Israel— all the tribal heads and family leaders of the Israelites—
c35640	to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD ... the City of David.
c35641	from Zion,
c35642	And all the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the feast ... the month of Ethanim.
c35643	in the seventh month,
c35644	When all the elders of Israel had arrived,
c35645	the priests took up the ark,
c35646	and they brought up the ark of the LORD and the Tent of Meeting with all ... sacred furnishings.
c35647	[its]
c35648	So the priests and Levites carried them up.
c35649	King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel
c35650	who had assembled with him
c35651	There, before the ark,
c35652	sacrificed ... sheep and oxen
c35653	that they could not be counted
c35654	so many ... or numbered.
c35655	Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
c35656	For the cherubim spread their wings over the place ... the ark
c35657	of the ark and overshadowed ... and its poles.
c35658	were so long that their
c35659	The poles ... ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary,
c35660	but not from outside [the Holy Place];
c35661	and they are there to this day.
c35662	[There was] nothing in the ark
c35663	except the two stone tablets
c35664	that Moses had placed in it at Horeb,
c35665	where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites
c35666	after they had come out of the land of Egypt.
c35667	And
c35668	when the priests came out of the Holy Place,
c35669	the cloud filled the house of the LORD
c35670	so that the priests could not
c35671	stand there
c35672	to minister
c35673	because of the cloud;
c35674	for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.
c35675	Then Solomon said:
c35676	“The LORD has said
c35677	that He would dwell in the thick cloud.
c35678	I have indeed built You an exalted house,
c35679	a place
c35680	for You to dwell forever.”
c35681	the king turned around
c35682	and blessed [them] all
c35683	And as the whole assembly of Israel stood [there],
c35684	and said:
c35685	“Blessed [be] the LORD, the God of Israel,
c35686	[who] ... what He spoke with His mouth to my father David,
c35687	has fulfilled with His own hand
c35688	saying,
c35689	‘Since the day
c35690	I brought My people Israel out of Egypt,
c35691	I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel
c35692	[in which] to build a house
c35693	so that My Name would be there.
c35694	But I have chosen David
c35695	to be over My people Israel.’
c35696	Now it was in the heart of my father David
c35697	to build a house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
c35698	But the LORD said to my father David,
c35699	‘Since it was in your heart ... in
c35700	to build a house for My Name,
c35701	you have done well
c35702	to have this ... your heart.
c35703	Nevertheless, you are not the one to build it;
c35704	but your son,
c35705	your own offspring,
c35706	will build the house for My Name.’
c35707	Now the LORD has fulfilled the word
c35708	that He spoke.
c35709	I have succeeded my father David,
c35710	and I sit on the throne of Israel,
c35711	as the LORD promised.
c35712	I have built the house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
c35713	And there I have provided a place for the ark,
c35714	which contains the covenant of the LORD
c35715	that He made with our fathers
c35716	when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.”
c35717	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel,
c35718	spread out his hands toward heaven,
c35719	and said:
c35720	“O LORD, God of Israel,
c35721	there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth below,
c35722	keeping [Your] covenant of loving devotion with Your servants
c35723	who walk before You with all their hearts.
c35724	You have kept ... to Your servant, my father David.
c35725	Your promise
c35726	What You spoke with Your mouth
c35727	You have fulfilled with Your hand
c35728	this day.
c35729	Therefore now,
c35730	O LORD, God of Israel,
c35731	keep for Your servant, my father David,
c35732	what You promised
c35733	when You said:
c35734	‘You will never fail to have a man ... before Me
c35735	to sit ... on the throne of Israel,
c35736	if only your descendants guard their way
c35737	to walk before Me
c35738	as you have [done].’
c35739	And now,
c35740	O God of Israel,
c35741	please confirm ... You promised
c35742	what ... to Your servant, my father David.
c35743	But
c35744	will God indeed dwell upon the earth?
c35745	Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You,
c35746	much less this temple
c35747	I have built.
c35748	Yet regard the prayer and plea of Your servant,
c35749	O LORD my God,
c35750	so that You may hear the cry and the prayer
c35751	that Your servant is praying before You today.
c35752	May Your eyes be open toward this temple night and day,
c35753	toward the place
c35754	of which You said,
c35755	‘My Name shall be there,’
c35756	so that You may hear the prayer ... toward
c35757	that Your servant prays ... this place.
c35758	Hear the plea of Your servant and of Your people Israel
c35759	when they pray toward this place.
c35760	May You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place.
c35761	May You hear
c35762	and forgive.
c35763	When a man sins against his neighbor
c35764	and is required to take an oath,
c35766	and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple,
c35767	may You hear from heaven
c35768	and act.
c35769	May You judge Your servants,
c35770	condemning the wicked man
c35771	by bringing down on his own head what he has done,
c35772	and justifying the righteous man
c35773	by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
c35774	When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy
c35775	because they have sinned against You,
c35776	and they return to You
c35777	and confess Your name,
c35778	praying
c35779	and pleading with You in this house,
c35780	may You hear from heaven
c35781	and forgive the sin of Your people Israel.
c35782	May You restore them to the land
c35783	You gave to their fathers.
c35784	When the skies are shut
c35785	and there is no rain
c35786	because [Your people] have sinned against You,
c35787	and they pray toward this place
c35788	and confess Your name,
c35789	and they turn from their sins
c35790	because You have afflicted them,
c35791	may You hear from heaven
c35792	and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel,
c35793	so that You may teach them the good way
c35794	in which they should walk.
c35795	May You send rain on the land
c35796	that You gave Your people as an inheritance.
c35797	famine
c35798	When ... comes upon the land,
c35799	pestilence
c35801	blight [or] mildew [or] locusts [or] grasshoppers,
c35802	[or] ... [or]
c35803	when their enemy besieges them in their cities,
c35804	whatever plague [or] sickness [there is],
c35805	may whatever prayer or petition
c35806	Your people Israel make—
c35807	knowing
c35808	each ... his own afflictions
c35809	and spreading out his hands toward this house—
c35810	be heard by You from heaven, Your dwelling place.
c35811	And may You forgive
c35812	and act,
c35813	and repay each man according to all his ways,
c35814	since You know his heart—
c35815	for You alone know the hearts of all men—
c35816	so that they may fear You all the days
c35817	they live in the land
c35818	You gave to our fathers.
c35819	And as for the foreigner
c35820	who is not of Your people Israel
c35821	but has come from a distant land because of Your name—
c35822	for they will hear of Your great name and mighty hand and outstretched arm—
c35823	when he comes
c35824	and prays toward this house,
c35825	may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place,
c35826	and do according to all
c35827	for which the foreigner calls to You.
c35828	Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name
c35829	and fear You, as [do] Your people Israel,
c35830	and they will know
c35831	that this house ... is called by Your Name.
c35832	I have built
c35833	When Your people go to war against their enemies, wherever
c35834	You send them,
c35835	and when they pray to the LORD in the direction of the city
c35836	You have chosen
c35837	and the house
c35838	I have built for Your Name,
c35839	may You hear from heaven their prayer and their plea,
c35840	and may You uphold their cause.
c35841	When they sin against You—
c35842	for there is no one
c35843	who does not sin—
c35844	and You become angry with them
c35845	and deliver them to an enemy
c35846	who takes them as captives to his own land, whether far or near,
c35847	to their senses in the land ... and they repent
c35848	to which they were taken,
c35849	and when they come
c35850	and plead with You in the land of their captors,
c35851	saying,
c35852	‘We have sinned
c35853	and done wrong;
c35854	we have acted wickedly,’
c35855	and when they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of the enemies
c35856	who took them captive,
c35857	and when they pray to You in the direction of the land
c35858	that You gave to their fathers,
c35859	the city
c35860	You have chosen,
c35861	and the house
c35862	I have built for Your Name,
c35863	then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and petition,
c35864	and may You uphold their cause.
c35865	May You forgive Your people
c35866	who have sinned against You
c35867	and all the transgressions
c35868	they have committed against You,
c35869	and may You grant them compassion in the eyes of their captors
c35870	to show them mercy.
c35871	For they are Your people and Your inheritance;
c35872	You brought them out of Egypt, out of the furnace for iron.
c35873	May Your eyes be open to the pleas of Your servant and [of] Your people Israel,
c35874	and may You listen to them whenever
c35875	they call to You.
c35876	For You, ... as Your inheritance, have set them apart from all the peoples of the earth,
c35877	as You spoke through Your servant Moses
c35878	when You brought our fathers out of Egypt.”
c35879	O Lord GOD,
c35880	Now when
c35881	Solomon finished
c35882	praying this entire prayer and petition to the LORD,
c35883	he got up before the altar of the LORD,
c35884	where he had been kneeling
c35885	with his hands spread out toward heaven.
c35886	And he stood
c35887	and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice,
c35888	saying:
c35889	“Blessed [be] the LORD,
c35890	who has given rest to His people Israel according to all
c35891	that He promised.
c35892	Not one word has failed of all the good promises
c35893	He made through His servant Moses.
c35894	May the LORD our God be with us,
c35895	as He was with our fathers.
c35896	May He never leave us
c35897	[or] forsake us.
c35898	May He incline our hearts to Himself,
c35899	to walk in all His ways
c35900	and to keep the commandments and statutes and ordinances
c35901	He commanded our fathers.
c35902	And may these words
c35903	with which I have made my petition before the LORD
c35904	be near to the LORD our God day and night,
c35905	so that He may uphold the cause of His servant [and] of His people Israel as each day requires,
c35906	so that all the peoples of the earth may know
c35907	that the LORD
c35908	is God.
c35909	There is no other!
c35910	So let your heart be fully devoted to the LORD our God,
c35911	to walk in His statutes
c35912	and to keep His commandments.”
c35913	as it is this day,
c35914	Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD.
c35915	And Solomon offered as peace offerings
c35916	to the LORD
c35917	22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep.
c35918	So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the house of the LORD.
c35919	On that same day, the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard
c35920	in front of the house of the LORD,
c35921	and there he offered the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings,
c35922	since the bronze altar
c35923	before the LORD
c35924	was too small
c35925	to contain [all these offerings].
c35926	So at that time Solomon ... observed the feast
c35927	and all Israel with him—
c35928	a great assembly of people
c35929	from Lebo-hamath
c35930	to the Brook of Egypt—
c35931	before the LORD our God for seven days and seven [more] days— fourteen days in all.
c35932	On the [fifteenth] day [Solomon] sent the people away.
c35933	So they blessed the king
c35934	and went home,
c35935	joyful and glad in heart for all the good things
c35936	that the LORD had done for His servant David and for His people Israel.
c35937	Now
c35938	when Solomon had finished
c35939	building the house of the LORD and the royal palace, ... all ... [he] had desired
c35940	that ... to do,
c35941	and had achieved
c35942	the LORD appeared to [him] a second [time],
c35943	as He had appeared to him at Gibeon.
c35944	And the LORD said to him,
c35945	“I have heard your prayer and petition
c35946	before Me.
c35947	I have consecrated this temple
c35948	you have built
c35949	by putting My Name ... forever; ... there
c35950	there ... My eyes and My heart will be ... for all time.
c35951	And as for you,
c35952	if you walk before
c35953	Me as your father David walked, with a heart of integrity and uprightness,
c35954	doing all
c35955	I have commanded you,
c35956	and if you keep My statutes and ordinances,
c35957	then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever,
c35958	as I promised your father David ... on
c35959	when I said,
c35960	‘You will never fail to have a man ... the throne of Israel.’
c35961	But if indeed you or your sons turn away from following Me
c35962	and do not keep the commandments [and] statutes
c35963	I have set before you,
c35964	and if you go off
c35965	to serve ... other gods,
c35966	and worship
c35967	then I will cut off Israel from the land
c35968	I have given them,
c35969	and this temple
c35970	that I have sanctified for My name
c35971	I will banish from My presence.
c35972	Then Israel will become an object of scorn and ridicule among all peoples.
c35973	And this temple will now become a heap of rubble.
c35974	All
c35975	who pass by it
c35976	will be appalled
c35977	and will hiss
c35978	and say,
c35979	‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’
c35980	And [others] will answer,
c35981	‘Because they have forsaken the LORD their God
c35982	who brought their fathers out of Egypt,
c35983	and have embraced other gods,
c35984	worshiping
c35985	and serving them.
c35986	Because of this, the LORD has brought all this disaster upon them.’”
c35987	Now at the end of the twenty years
c35988	during which Solomon built these two houses, the house of the LORD and the royal palace,
c35989	to Hiram king of Tyre, who had supplied him with cedar and cypress logs and gold for his every desire.
c35990	King Solomon gave twenty towns in the land of Galilee
c35991	So Hiram went out from Tyre
c35992	to look over the towns
c35993	that Solomon had given him,
c35994	but he was not pleased with them.
c35995	asked [Hiram],
c35996	“What are these towns
c35997	you have given me,
c35998	my brother?”
c35999	and he called them the land of Cabul, as they are [called] to this day.
c36000	And Hiram had sent the king 120 talents of gold.
c36001	This is the account of the forced labor
c36002	that King Solomon imposed
c36003	to build the house of the LORD, his own palace, the supporting terraces, and the wall of Jerusalem, as well as Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
c36004	Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked
c36005	and captured Gezer.
c36006	He had set it on fire,
c36007	the Canaanites
c36008	who lived in the city,
c36009	killed
c36010	and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.
c36011	So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, Lower Beth-horon,
c36012	Baalath, and Tamar in the Wilderness [of Judah],
c36013	as well as all the store cities
c36014	that Solomon had
c36015	for his chariots and horses—
c36016	[he] desired
c36017	whatever
c36018	to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion.
c36019	As for all the people
c36020	who remained of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites
c36021	(the people who were not Israelites)—
c36022	their descendants
c36023	who remained in the land,
c36024	those whom the Israelites were unable
c36025	to destroy completely—
c36026	Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day.
c36027	But Solomon did not consign any of the Israelites to slavery,
c36028	because they [were] his men of war, his servants, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry.
c36029	[They] [were also] the chief officers
c36030	over Solomon’s projects:
c36031	550
c36032	supervisors over the people
c36033	who did the work.
c36034	As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace
c36035	that [Solomon] had built for her,
c36036	he built the supporting terraces.
c36037	Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar
c36038	he had built for the LORD,
c36039	burning incense with them
c36040	before the LORD.
c36041	So he completed the temple.
c36042	King Solomon also assembled a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber,
c36043	which is near Eloth [in] Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.
c36044	And Hiram sent his servants, men who knew the sea, [to serve] in the fleet with Solomon’s servants.
c36045	They sailed to Ophir
c36046	and imported gold from there— 420 talents—
c36047	and delivered it to Solomon.
c36048	Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD,
c36049	she came
c36050	to test him with difficult questions.
c36051	in Jerusalem with a very large caravan, ... So she came
c36052	with camels bearing spices, gold in great abundance, and precious stones.
c36053	She arrived ... Solomon ... to him
c36054	to ... and spoke ... all
c36055	that was on her mind.
c36056	And Solomon answered all her questions;
c36057	nothing was too difficult for the king
c36058	to explain.
c36059	When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the palace
c36060	he had built,
c36061	the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and cupbearers, and the burnt offerings
c36062	he presented at the house of the LORD,
c36063	it took her breath away.
c36064	She said to the king,
c36065	“The report ... is true.
c36066	I heard in my own country about your words [and] wisdom
c36067	But I did not believe these things
c36068	until I came
c36069	and saw with my own eyes.
c36070	Indeed,
c36071	not even half was told to me.
c36072	Your wisdom and prosperity have far exceeded the report
c36073	I heard.
c36074	How blessed are your men!
c36075	How blessed are these servants of yours
c36076	who stand continually before you
c36077	[and] hear your wisdom!
c36078	Blessed be the LORD your God,
c36079	who has delighted in you
c36080	to set you on the throne of Israel.
c36081	Because of the LORD’s eternal love for Israel,
c36082	He has made you king
c36083	to carry out justice and righteousness.”
c36084	Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones.
c36085	Never again was such an abundance of spices brought in
c36086	as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
c36087	(The fleet of Hiram, ... also
c36088	which brought gold from Ophir,
c36089	brought from Ophir a great cargo of almug wood and precious stones.
c36090	The king made the almug wood into steps for the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers.
c36091	Never before had such almug wood been brought in,
c36092	nor has such been seen to this day.)
c36093	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired—
c36094	whatever she asked—
c36095	besides
c36096	what he had given her out of [his] royal bounty.
c36097	left
c36098	Then she ... and returned to her own country, along with her servants.
c36099	The weight of gold ... was
c36100	that came to Solomon each year
c36101	666 talents,
c36102	not including the revenue from the merchants, traders, and all the Arabian kings and governors of the land.
c36103	King Solomon made two hundred large shields [of] hammered gold;
c36104	six hundred [shekels] of gold went into each shield.
c36105	[He also made] three hundred small shields of hammered gold;
c36106	three minas of gold went into each shield.
c36107	And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
c36108	Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory
c36109	and overlaid it with pure gold.
c36110	The throne had six steps
c36111	and a rounded top at the back of the throne.
c36112	There were armrests on both sides of the seat,
c36113	with [a] lion standing beside each armrest.
c36114	Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each [step].
c36115	Nothing like [this] had ever been made for any kingdom.
c36116	All of King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold,
c36117	and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold.
c36118	There was no silver,
c36119	because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.
c36120	For the king had the ships of Tarshish at sea with Hiram’s fleet,
c36121	and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive
c36122	bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
c36123	So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
c36124	The whole world sought an audience with Solomon
c36125	to hear the wisdom
c36126	that God had put in his heart.
c36127	would bring
c36128	[each] visitor ... his tribute:
c36129	Year after year, ... articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
c36130	Solomon accumulated ... chariots ... horses,
c36131	1,400 ... and 12,000 ... in the chariot
c36132	which he stationed ... cities and also with [him] in Jerusalem.
c36133	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones,
c36134	and cedar ... as sycamore
c36135	as abundant ... in the foothills.
c36136	horses were imported
c36137	Solomon’s
c36138	from Egypt
c36139	and Kue;
c36140	the royal merchants purchased them in Kue.
c36141	could be imported
c36142	A chariot ... from Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver,
c36143	and a horse for a hundred and fifty.
c36144	Likewise, [they] exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram.
c36145	King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh— women of Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidon, as well as Hittite women.
c36146	[These women were] from the nations
c36147	about which the LORD had told the Israelites,
c36148	“You must not intermarry with them,
c36150	for surely they will turn your hearts after their gods.”
c36151	Yet Solomon clung to these [women] in love.
c36152	He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines—
c36153	and his wives turned his heart away.
c36154	For when Solomon grew old,
c36155	his wives turned his heart after other gods,
c36156	and he was not wholeheartedly devoted to the LORD his God, as his father David had been.
c36157	Solomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Molech the abomination of the Ammonites.
c36158	So Solomon did
c36159	evil in the sight of the LORD—
c36160	and unlike his father David, he did not follow the LORD completely.
c36161	At that time on a hill ... Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab
c36162	east of Jerusalem,
c36163	and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites.
c36164	He did the same for all his foreign wives,
c36165	who burned incense
c36166	and sacrificed to their gods.
c36167	Now the LORD grew angry with Solomon,
c36168	because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel,
c36169	who had appeared to him twice.
c36170	Although He had warned [Solomon] explicitly
c36171	not to follow other gods,
c36172	Solomon did not observe
c36173	what the LORD had commanded.
c36174	Then the LORD said to Solomon,
c36175	“Because you have done this
c36176	and have not kept My covenant and My statutes,
c36177	which I have commanded you,
c36178	I will tear the kingdom away from you
c36179	and give it to your servant.
c36180	Nevertheless, for the sake of your father David, I will not do it during your lifetime;
c36181	I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
c36182	Yet I will not {tear} the whole kingdom away from him.
c36183	I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem,
c36184	which I have chosen.”
c36185	Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite,
c36186	from the royal line of Edom.
c36187	Earlier,
c36188	when David was in Edom,
c36189	Joab the commander of the army had gone
c36190	to bury the dead
c36191	and had struck down every male in Edom.
c36192	For Joab and all Israel had stayed there six months,
c36193	until he had killed every male in Edom.
c36194	But Hadad, ... had fled
c36195	still just ... along with some Edomites who were servants of his father.
c36196	to Egypt,
c36197	a young boy,
c36198	Hadad and his men set out from Midian
c36199	and went to Paran.
c36200	They took men from Paran with them
c36201	and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c36202	who gave Hadad a house ... with food.
c36203	and provided him
c36204	and land
c36205	There Hadad found such great favor in the sight of Pharaoh
c36206	that he gave to him in marriage the sister of Queen Tahpenes, his own wife.
c36207	And the sister of Tahpenes bore [Hadad] a son named Genubath.
c36208	Tahpenes herself weaned him in Pharaoh’s palace,
c36209	and Genubath lived there among the sons of Pharaoh.
c36210	When Hadad heard in Egypt
c36211	that David had rested with his fathers
c36212	and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead,
c36213	he said to Pharaoh,
c36214	“Let me go,
c36215	so I may return to my own country.”
c36216	But Pharaoh asked him,
c36217	“What have you lacked here with me ... “but
c36218	that you suddenly want
c36219	to go back to your own country?”
c36220	[Hadad] replied,
c36221	“Nothing,”
c36222	please let me go.”
c36223	And God raised up against [Solomon] [another] adversary, Rezon the son of Eliada,
c36224	who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah
c36225	and had gathered men to himself.
c36226	[Rezon] captained a band [of raiders]
c36227	When David killed the Zobaites,
c36228	and went to Damascus,
c36229	where they settled
c36230	and gained control.
c36231	Rezon was Israel’s enemy throughout the days of Solomon,
c36232	adding to the trouble
c36233	[caused by] Hadad.
c36234	with hostility toward Israel.
c36235	So [Rezon] ruled over Aram
c36236	Jeroboam son of Nebat, was an Ephraimite from Zeredah,
c36237	and his mother [was] a widow named Zeruah.
c36238	Now Solomon’s servant,
c36239	Jeroboam rebelled against Solomon,
c36240	and this is the account
c36241	of his rebellion against the king.
c36242	Solomon had built the supporting terraces
c36243	and repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David.
c36244	And Jeroboam [was] a mighty man of valor,
c36245	so Solomon noticed ... the young man
c36246	that ... was industrious
c36247	and put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.
c36248	During that time,
c36249	as [he] was going out of Jerusalem.
c36250	the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met [Jeroboam] on the road
c36251	Now Ahijah had wrapped himself in a new cloak,
c36252	and the two of them were alone in the open field.
c36253	And Ahijah took hold of the new cloak
c36254	he was wearing,
c36255	tore it into twelve pieces,
c36256	and said to Jeroboam,
c36257	“Take ten pieces for yourself,
c36258	for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c36259	‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon,
c36260	and I will give you ten tribes.
c36261	But one tribe will remain for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city
c36262	I chose out of all the tribes of Israel.
c36263	For they have forsaken Me
c36264	to worship Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Molech the god of the Ammonites.
c36265	They have not walked in My ways,
c36266	nor done
c36267	what is right in My eyes,
c36268	nor [kept] My statutes and judgments, as Solomon's father David did.
c36269	Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of [Solomon's] hand,
c36270	because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David My servant,
c36271	whom I chose
c36272	because he kept My commandments and statutes.
c36273	But I will take ... of the kingdom from the hand of his son
c36274	ten tribes ... and give them to you.
c36275	I will give one tribe to his son,
c36276	so that My servant David will always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city
c36277	where I chose
c36278	to put My name.
c36279	But as for you, I will take you,
c36280	and you shall reign over all
c36281	that your heart desires,
c36282	and you will be king over Israel.
c36283	then I will be
c36284	If you listen to all that
c36285	I command you, ... as
c36286	walk in My ways,
c36287	and do
c36288	what is right in My sight
c36289	in order to keep My statutes and commandments
c36290	My servant David did, ... just as
c36291	with you.
c36292	I will build you a lasting dynasty
c36293	I built for David,
c36294	and I will give Israel to you.
c36295	Because of this, I will humble David’s descendants—
c36296	but not forever.’”
c36297	Solomon therefore sought
c36298	to kill Jeroboam.
c36299	But Jeroboam arose
c36300	and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt,
c36301	where he remained until the death of Solomon.
c36302	As for the rest of the acts of Solomon— all
c36303	that he did,
c36304	as well as his wisdom—
c36305	[are] they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?
c36306	Thus, the time
c36307	that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
c36308	[was] forty years.
c36309	And Solomon rested with his fathers
c36310	and was buried in the city of his father David.
c36311	And his son Rehoboam became king in his place.
c36312	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem,
c36313	for all Israel had gone [there]
c36314	to make him king.
c36316	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about this,
c36317	he was
c36318	still in Egypt
c36319	where he had fled from King Solomon
c36320	and had been living ever since.
c36321	So they sent for
c36322	[Jeroboam],
c36323	and [he] and the whole assembly of Israel came
c36324	to Rehoboam and said,
c36326	“Your father put a heavy yoke on us.
c36327	you
c36328	But now ... should lighten the burden of your father’s service and the heavy yoke
c36329	he put on us,
c36330	and we will serve you.”
c36331	Rehoboam answered, ... to me.”
c36332	“Go away for three days
c36333	and then return
c36334	So the people departed.
c36335	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders
c36336	who
c36337	had served his father Solomon
c36338	during his lifetime.
c36339	he asked.
c36340	“How do you advise
c36341	me to respond to these people?”
c36342	They replied,
c36344	“If you will be a servant to these people ... this day,
c36345	and serve them
c36346	and if you will respond
c36347	by speaking kind words to them,
c36348	they will be your servants forever.”
c36349	But [Rehoboam] rejected the advice of the elders;
c36351	instead, he consulted the young men
c36352	who had grown up with him
c36353	and served him.
c36354	He asked them,
c36355	“What ... do you advise
c36356	message ... that we send back to these people
c36357	who have spoken to me,
c36358	saying,
c36359	‘Lighten the yoke
c36360	your father put on us’?”
c36361	The young men ... replied, ... to you,
c36362	who had grown up with him
c36364	“This is how you should answer these people
c36365	who said
c36367	‘Your father made our yoke heavy,
c36368	but you should make it lighter.’
c36369	This is what you should tell them:
c36370	‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist!
c36371	Although
c36372	my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, ... to
c36373	I will add ... your yoke.
c36374	Although my father scourged you with whips,
c36375	I will scourge you with scorpions.’”
c36376	After three days, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam,
c36377	since the king had said,
c36379	“Come back to me on the third day.”
c36380	And the king answered the people harshly.
c36381	He rejected the advice of the elders
c36383	and spoke to them as the young men had advised,
c36384	saying,
c36385	“Although my father made your yoke heavy,
c36386	I will add to your yoke.
c36387	Although my father scourged you with whips,
c36388	I will scourge you with scorpions!”
c36389	So the king did not listen to the people,
c36390	and indeed this turn of events was from the LORD,
c36391	to fulfill the word
c36392	[He] had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.
c36393	When all Israel saw
c36394	that the king had refused to listen to them,
c36395	[they] answered the king:
c36397	“What portion do we have in David,
c36398	and what inheritance in the son of Jesse?
c36399	To your tents,
c36400	O Israel!
c36401	Look now to your own house,
c36402	O David!”
c36403	So the Israelites went home,
c36404	the Israelites
c36405	living in the cities of Judah.
c36406	but Rehoboam still reigned over
c36407	Then King Rehoboam sent out Adoram,
c36408	who was in charge of the labor force,
c36409	but all Israel stoned
c36410	him to death.
c36411	And King Rehoboam ... in haste
c36412	mounted his chariot
c36413	and escaped to Jerusalem.
c36414	So to this day Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David.
c36416	When all Israel heard
c36417	that Jeroboam had returned,
c36418	they summoned
c36419	him to the assembly
c36420	and made him king over all Israel.
c36421	Only the tribe of Judah followed the house of David.
c36422	And when Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem,
c36423	he mobilized the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin— 180,000 choice
c36424	warriors—
c36425	to fight against the house of Israel
c36426	and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
c36427	But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:
c36429	“Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people
c36431	that this is what the LORD says:
c36432	‘You are not to go up
c36433	and fight against your brothers, the Israelites.
c36434	of you must return
c36435	Each ... home,
c36436	for this word is from Me.’”
c36437	So they listened to the word of the LORD
c36438	and turned back
c36440	according to the word of the LORD.
c36441	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim
c36442	and lived there. And from
c36443	there he went out
c36444	and built Penuel.
c36445	Jeroboam said in his heart,
c36446	“Now, the kingdom might revert to the house of David.
c36447	If ... people go up
c36448	to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem,
c36449	these ... their hearts will return to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah;
c36450	then they will kill
c36451	me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”
c36452	After seeking advice, the king
c36453	made two golden calves
c36454	and said to the people,
c36455	is too much for you.
c36456	“Going to Jerusalem
c36457	Here, ... are your gods,
c36458	O Israel,
c36459	which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”
c36460	One [calf] he set up in Bethel,
c36461	[and] the other in Dan.
c36462	And this thing became a sin;
c36463	the people walked as far as Dan [to worship] before one [of the calves].
c36464	Jeroboam also built shrines on the high places
c36465	and appointed from every class of people priests
c36466	who were not Levites.
c36467	And Jeroboam ordained a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival
c36468	that [was] in Judah,
c36469	and he offered sacrifices on the altar;
c36470	he made this offering in Bethel
c36471	to sacrifice to the calves
c36472	he had set up,
c36473	and he installed priests in Bethel for the high places
c36474	he had set up.
c36475	[Jeroboam] offered sacrifices on the altar
c36476	he had set up in Bethel.
c36477	On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month
c36478	of his own choosing,
c36479	So he ordained a festival for the Israelites,
c36480	offered sacrifices on the altar,
c36481	and burned incense.
c36482	Suddenly,
c36483	there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD.
c36484	as Jeroboam was standing beside the altar
c36485	to burn incense,
c36486	And he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD,
c36487	says:
c36488	“O altar, O altar,
c36489	this is what the LORD
c36490	‘A son ... will be born to the house of David,
c36491	named Josiah
c36492	he will sacrifice the priests of the high places ... on you,
c36493	and upon you ... who burn incense
c36494	and human bones will be burned on you.’”
c36495	That day [the man of God] gave a sign,
c36496	saying,
c36497	“This is the sign
c36498	that the LORD has spoken:
c36499	‘Surely the altar will be split apart,
c36500	and the ashes ... will be poured out.’”
c36501	upon it
c36502	Now when
c36503	King ... heard the word ... the man of God
c36504	in Bethel, ... that ... had cried out against [it],
c36505	Jeroboam, who was at the altar ... he stretched out his hand
c36506	and said,
c36507	“Seize him!”
c36508	But the hand ... withered,
c36509	he stretched out toward him
c36510	so that he could not
c36511	pull it back.
c36512	And the altar was split apart,
c36513	and the ashes poured out,
c36514	according to the sign
c36515	that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
c36516	Then the king responded
c36517	to the man of God,
c36518	“Intercede with the LORD your God
c36519	and pray that my
c36520	hand may be restored.”
c36521	So the man of God interceded with the LORD,
c36522	and the king’s hand was restored to him
c36523	as [it was] before.
c36524	Then the king said to the man of God,
c36525	“Come home with me
c36526	and refresh yourself,
c36527	and I will give you a reward.”
c36528	But the man of God replied,
c36529	“If you were to give me half your possessions,
c36530	I still would not go with you,
c36531	nor would I eat bread
c36532	or drink water in this place.
c36533	For this is what I was commanded by the word of the LORD:
c36535	‘You must not eat bread
c36536	or drink water
c36537	or return by the way
c36538	you came.’”
c36539	So [the man of God] went another way
c36540	and did not return by the way
c36541	he had come to Bethel.
c36542	Now a certain old prophet was living in Bethel,
c36543	and his sons came
c36544	and told him all the deeds
c36545	that the man of God had done that day in Bethel.
c36546	the words
c36547	that [the man] had spoken to the king.
c36548	They also told their father
c36549	their father asked.
c36550	“Which ... the way
c36551	did he go?”
c36552	way ... And his sons had seen
c36553	taken by the man of God,
c36554	who had come from Judah.
c36555	So [the prophet] said to his sons,
c36556	“Saddle the donkey for me.”
c36557	Then they saddled the donkey for him,
c36558	and he mounted it
c36559	and went after the man of God.
c36560	He found him
c36561	sitting under an oak tree
c36562	and asked,
c36563	“Are you the man of God
c36564	who came from Judah?”
c36565	he replied.
c36566	“I [am],”
c36567	Then [the prophet] said to [the man of God],
c36568	“Come home with me
c36569	and eat some bread.”
c36570	But [the man] replied,
c36571	“I cannot
c36572	return with you
c36574	or eat bread
c36575	or drink water with you in this place.
c36576	For I have been told by the word of the LORD:
c36577	‘You must not eat bread
c36578	or drink water there
c36579	or return
c36580	by the way you came.’”
c36582	Then [the prophet] replied,
c36583	“I too [am] a prophet like you,
c36584	and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD,
c36585	saying,
c36586	‘Bring him back with you to your house,
c36587	so that he may eat bread
c36588	and drink water.’”
c36589	The old prophet was lying to him,
c36590	but the man of God went back with him,
c36591	ate bread in his house,
c36592	and drank water.
c36593	came
c36594	While they were sitting at the table,
c36595	the word of the LORD ... to the prophet
c36596	who had brought him back,
c36597	and the prophet cried out to the man of God
c36598	who had come from Judah,
c36599	says:
c36600	“This is what the LORD
c36601	‘Because you have defied the word of the LORD
c36602	and have not kept the commandment
c36603	that the LORD your God gave you,
c36604	but you went back
c36605	and ate bread
c36606	and drank water in the place
c36607	where He told you
c36608	not to do so,
c36610	your body shall never reach the tomb of your fathers.’”
c36611	And
c36612	after [the man of God] had finished eating
c36613	and drinking,
c36614	the old prophet ... saddled the donkey for him.
c36615	who had brought him back
c36616	As he went on his way,
c36617	a lion met him on the road
c36618	and killed him,
c36619	and his body was
c36620	left lying in the road,
c36621	with the donkey
c36622	and the lion standing beside [it].
c36623	And there were men passing by
c36624	who saw the body
c36625	lying in the road
c36626	with the lion
c36627	standing beside it,
c36628	and they went
c36629	and reported this in the city
c36630	where the old prophet lived.
c36631	When the prophet ... heard this,
c36632	who had brought him back from his journey
c36633	he said,
c36634	“It [is] the man of God
c36635	who disobeyed the command of the LORD.
c36636	Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion,
c36637	and it has mauled him
c36638	and killed him, according to the word that the LORD
c36639	had spoken to him.”
c36640	Then the old prophet instructed his sons,
c36642	“Saddle the donkey for me.”
c36643	So they saddled [it],
c36644	and he went
c36645	and found the body
c36646	lying in the road,
c36647	with the donkey and the lion standing beside [it].
c36648	The lion had not eaten the body
c36649	or mauled the donkey.
c36650	So the old prophet lifted up the body of the man of God,
c36651	laid it on the donkey,
c36652	and brought it back
c36653	to his own city
c36654	to mourn for him
c36655	and bury him.
c36656	Then he laid the body in his own tomb,
c36657	and they lamented over him,
c36658	“Oh, my brother!”
c36660	After he had buried him,
c36661	[the prophet] said to his sons,
c36663	“When I die,
c36664	you must bury me in the tomb
c36665	where the man of God is buried.
c36666	Lay my bones beside his bones,
c36667	for the message ... will surely come to pass.”
c36668	that he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar
c36669	in Bethel
c36670	and against all the shrines on the high places
c36671	in the cities of Samaria
c36672	Even after these events, Jeroboam did not repent of his evil ways,
c36673	but again
c36674	he appointed priests for the high places from every class of people.
c36675	anyone who desired
c36676	He ordained
c36677	to be a priest of the high places.
c36678	And this was the sin of the house of Jeroboam
c36679	that led to its extermination
c36680	and destruction from the face of the earth.
c36681	At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill,
c36682	and Jeroboam said to his wife,
c36683	“Please arise,
c36684	disguise yourself
c36685	so they will not recognize
c36686	you as [my] wife,
c36687	and go to Shiloh.
c36688	For Ahijah the prophet is there;
c36689	it was he who spoke about my kingship over this people.
c36690	Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey,
c36691	and go to him.
c36692	He will tell you
c36693	what will become of the boy.”
c36694	Jeroboam’s wife did as [instructed];
c36695	she arose
c36696	and went to Shiloh
c36697	and arrived at Ahijah’s house.
c36698	Now Ahijah could not
c36699	see,
c36700	for his eyes were dim because of his age.
c36701	But the LORD had said to Ahijah,
c36702	“Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming
c36703	to ask you about her son,
c36704	for he is ill.
c36705	You are to say such and such to her,
c36706	because
c36707	when she arrives,
c36708	she will be disguised.”
c36709	So
c36710	when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet
c36711	entering the door,
c36712	he said,
c36713	“Come in,
c36714	wife of Jeroboam!
c36715	Why are you disguised?
c36716	For I [have been] sent to you [with] bad [news].
c36717	Go,
c36718	tell Jeroboam
c36719	that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c36720	‘I raised you up from among the people
c36721	and appointed you ruler over My people Israel.
c36722	I tore the kingdom away from the house of David
c36723	and gave it to you.
c36724	But you were not like My servant David,
c36725	who kept My commandments
c36726	and followed Me with all his heart,
c36727	doing only [what was] right in My eyes.
c36728	more evil
c36729	You have done
c36730	than all
c36731	who came before you.
c36732	You have proceeded
c36733	to make for yourself other gods and cast images
c36734	to provoke
c36735	Me, and you have flung Me behind your back.
c36736	Because of all this, behold, I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam:
c36737	I will cut off from Jeroboam
c36738	every male,
c36739	both slave
c36740	and free in Israel;
c36741	I will sweep away the house of Jeroboam
c36742	as one sweeps away dung
c36743	until it is gone!
c36744	Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city
c36745	will be eaten by dogs,
c36747	and anyone who dies in the field
c36748	will be eaten by the birds of the air.
c36749	For the LORD has spoken.’
c36750	As for you, get up
c36751	and go home.
c36752	When your feet enter the city,
c36753	the child will die.
c36754	All Israel will mourn for him
c36755	and bury him,
c36756	for this [is] the only one belonging to Jeroboam who shall come to the grave,
c36757	because only in him has the LORD, the God of Israel, found any good in the house of Jeroboam.
c36758	Moreover , the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel
c36759	who will cut off the house of Jeroboam.
c36760	This is the day—
c36761	yes, even today!
c36762	For the LORD will strike Israel
c36763	as a reed is shaken in the water.
c36764	He will uproot Israel from this good land
c36765	that He gave their fathers
c36766	and scatter them beyond the Euphrates,
c36767	because they have made their Asherah poles,
c36768	provoking the LORD {to anger}.
c36769	And He will give Israel over on account of the sins Jeroboam
c36770	has committed
c36771	and has caused Israel to commit.”
c36772	Then Jeroboam’s wife got up
c36773	and departed
c36774	for Tirzah,
c36775	and as soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house,
c36776	the boy died.
c36777	And they buried him,
c36778	and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word the LORD
c36779	had spoken through His servant Ahijah the prophet.
c36780	As for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam,
c36781	how he waged war
c36782	and how he reigned,
c36783	they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
c36784	And the length
c36785	of Jeroboam’s reign
c36786	[was] twenty-two years,
c36787	and he rested with his fathers,
c36788	and his son Nadab reigned in his place.
c36789	Meanwhile, Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah.
c36790	[He] was forty-one years old
c36791	when he became king,
c36792	and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
c36793	the LORD had chosen ... in which
c36794	to put His Name.
c36795	from all the tribes of Israel
c36796	His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
c36797	And Judah did
c36798	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c36799	they provoked Him to jealous anger more than all
c36800	their fathers had done.
c36801	and by the sins
c36802	they committed
c36803	They also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
c36804	There were even male cult prostitutes in the land.
c36805	They imitated all the abominations of the nations
c36806	the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
c36807	In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign,
c36808	Shishak king of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem.
c36809	He seized the treasuries of the house of the LORD [and] of the royal palace.
c36810	He took everything,
c36811	including all the gold shields
c36812	that Solomon had made.
c36813	So King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place
c36814	and committed [them] to the care of the captains of the guard
c36815	on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
c36816	And
c36817	whenever the king entered the house of the LORD,
c36818	the royal escorts bore the shields
c36819	and then took them back to the guardroom.
c36820	As for the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, along with all
c36821	that he did,
c36822	[are] they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c36823	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout [their] days.
c36824	And Rehoboam rested with his fathers
c36825	and was buried with his fathers in the City of David;
c36826	his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite.
c36827	And his son Abijam became king in his place.
c36828	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijam became king of Judah,
c36829	and he reigned in Jerusalem three years.
c36830	His mother’s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
c36831	Abijam walked in all the sins that his father
c36832	before him had committed,
c36833	and his heart was not as fully devoted to the LORD his God as the heart of David his forefather [had been].
c36834	Nevertheless, for the sake of David, the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem
c36835	by raising up a son to succeed him
c36836	and to make Jerusalem {strong}.
c36837	For David had done what was right in the eyes of the LORD
c36838	and did not turn aside from anything
c36839	[the LORD] commanded
c36840	all the days of his life,
c36841	except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
c36842	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of [Abijam's] life.
c36843	As for the rest of the acts of Abijam, along with all
c36844	his accomplishments,
c36845	[are] they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c36846	And there was also war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
c36847	And Abijam rested with his fathers
c36848	and was buried in the City of David,
c36849	and his son Asa reigned in his place.
c36850	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign over Israel, Asa became king of Judah,
c36851	and he reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years.
c36852	His grandmother’s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
c36853	And Asa did
c36854	what was right in the eyes of the LORD,
c36855	as David his forefather [had done].
c36856	He banished the male cult prostitutes from the land
c36857	and removed all of the idols
c36858	that his fathers had made.
c36859	He also ... his grandmother Maacah
c36860	removed ... as the queen mother,
c36861	because she had made a detestable Asherah pole.
c36862	Asa chopped down the pole
c36863	and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
c36864	The high places were not removed,
c36865	but Asa’s heart was fully devoted to the LORD all his days.
c36866	And he brought into the house of the LORD the silver and gold and other articles that he and his father had dedicated.
c36867	Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their days.
c36868	Baasha king of Israel went to war against Judah
c36869	and fortified Ramah
c36870	to prevent [anyone] from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
c36871	So Asa withdrew all the silver and gold
c36872	that remained in the treasuries of the house of the LORD
c36873	and of the royal palace.
c36874	He entrusted it to his servants
c36875	and sent them to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion king of Aram,
c36876	who was ruling in Damascus,
c36877	saying,
c36878	“[Let there be] a treaty between me and you, between
c36879	my father and your father.
c36880	See, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold.
c36881	Now go
c36882	and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel,
c36883	so that he will withdraw from me.”
c36884	And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa
c36885	and sent the commanders of his armies
c36887	against the cities of Israel,
c36888	conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and the whole land of Naphtali, including the region of Chinnereth.
c36889	When
c36890	Baasha learned of this,
c36891	he stopped
c36892	fortifying Ramah
c36893	and withdrew to Tirzah.
c36894	Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah,
c36895	with no exception,
c36896	and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers
c36897	Baasha had used for building.
c36898	And with [these materials] King Asa built up Geba of Benjamin, as well as Mizpah.
c36899	Now the rest of the acts of Asa, along with all his might, all
c36900	his accomplishments,
c36901	and the cities
c36902	he built,
c36903	[are] they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c36904	In his old age, however, he became diseased in his feet.
c36905	And Asa rested with his fathers
c36906	and was buried with his fathers in the City of his father David,
c36907	and his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place.
c36908	In the second year of Asa's reign over Judah, Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel,
c36909	and he reigned two years.
c36910	And he did
c36911	evil in the sight of the LORD
c36912	and walked in the way of his father and in his sin,
c36913	which he had caused Israel to commit.
c36914	Then Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against Nadab,
c36915	and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon
c36916	of the Philistines
c36917	while Nadab and all Israel were besieging [the city].
c36918	In the third year of Asa's reign over Judah, Baasha killed Nadab
c36919	and reigned in his place.
c36920	As soon as
c36921	Baasha became king,
c36922	he struck down the entire household of Jeroboam.
c36923	He did not leave Jeroboam anyone that breathed,
c36924	but destroyed them all
c36925	according to the word the LORD
c36926	had spoken through His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,
c36927	because of the sins Jeroboam
c36928	had committed
c36929	and had caused Israel to commit,
c36930	to anger.
c36931	and because he had provoked the LORD, the God of Israel,
c36932	As for the rest of the acts of Nadab, along with all
c36933	his accomplishments,
c36934	[are] they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c36935	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their days.
c36936	In the third year of Asa's reign over Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah twenty-four years.
c36937	And [Baasha] did
c36938	evil in the sight of the LORD
c36939	and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin,
c36940	which he had caused Israel to commit.
c36941	Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha,
c36942	saying:
c36943	“Even though I lifted you out of the dust
c36944	and made you ruler over My people Israel,
c36945	you have walked in the way of Jeroboam
c36946	and have caused My people Israel to sin
c36947	and to provoke Me to anger by their sins.
c36948	So now I will consume Baasha and his house,
c36949	and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat:
c36950	Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city
c36951	will be eaten by dogs,
c36953	and anyone who dies in the field
c36954	will be eaten by the birds of the air.”
c36955	As for the rest of the acts of Baasha,
c36956	along with his accomplishments
c36957	and might,
c36958	[are] they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c36959	And Baasha rested with his fathers
c36960	and was buried in Tirzah,
c36961	and his son Elah reigned in his place.
c36962	Moreover, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha [and] his house,
c36963	because of all the evil
c36964	he had done in the sight of the LORD,
c36965	provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands
c36966	and becoming like the house of Jeroboam,
c36967	and also because Baasha struck down the house of Jeroboam.
c36968	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa's reign over Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years.
c36969	[Elah's] servant Zimri, the commander of half his chariots, conspired against him.
c36970	However, while Elah was in Tirzah
c36971	getting drunk in the house of Arza
c36972	the steward of [his] household in Tirzah,
c36973	Zimri went in,
c36974	struck Elah down,
c36975	So in the twenty-seventh year of Asa's reign over Judah, ... and killed him.
c36976	And Zimri reigned in his place.
c36977	As soon as
c36978	[Zimri] began to reign
c36979	and was seated on the throne,
c36980	he struck down the entire household of Baasha.
c36981	He did not leave
c36982	a single male,
c36983	whether a kinsman or friend.
c36984	So Zimri destroyed the entire household of Baasha, according to the word the LORD
c36985	had spoken against Baasha through Jehu the prophet.
c36986	This happened because of all the sins Baasha [and] his son Elah
c36987	had committed
c36988	and had caused Israel to commit,
c36989	provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, {to anger} with their worthless idols.
c36990	As for the rest of the acts of Elah, along with all
c36991	his accomplishments,
c36992	[are] they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c36993	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa's reign over Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah for seven days.
c36994	Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon
c36995	of the Philistines,
c36996	and the people ... heard
c36997	in the camp
c36999	that Zimri had not only conspired
c37000	but had also struck down the king.
c37001	So there in the camp that very day, all Israel proclaimed Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel.
c37002	Then Omri ... marched up
c37003	and all the Israelites
c37004	from Gibbethon
c37005	and besieged Tirzah.
c37007	When Zimri saw
c37008	that the city was captured,
c37009	he entered the citadel of the royal palace
c37010	and burned it down on himself.
c37011	So he died
c37012	because of the sins
c37013	he had committed,
c37014	doing
c37015	evil in the sight of the LORD
c37016	and following the example of Jeroboam and the sin
c37017	he had committed
c37018	and had caused Israel to commit.
c37019	As for the rest of the acts of Zimri and the treason
c37020	he committed,
c37021	[are] they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c37022	At that time the people of Israel were divided: Half
c37023	of the people supported Tibni son of Ginath
c37024	as king,
c37025	and half supported Omri.
c37026	But the followers ... proved stronger
c37027	of Omri
c37028	than those
c37029	of Tibni son of Ginath.
c37030	So Tibni died
c37031	and Omri became king.
c37032	In the thirty-first year of Asa's reign over Judah, Omri became king of Israel, [and he reigned] twelve years, ... [of them]
c37033	six ... in Tirzah.
c37034	He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver
c37035	and built [a city] [there],
c37036	calling [it]
c37038	Samaria after the name of Shemer, who had owned the hill.
c37039	But Omri did
c37040	evil in the sight of the LORD
c37041	and acted more wickedly than all
c37042	who [were] before him.
c37043	For he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat and in his sins,
c37044	which he caused Israel to commit,
c37045	provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, {to anger} with their worthless idols.
c37046	As for the rest of the acts of Omri,
c37047	along with his accomplishments
c37048	and the might
c37049	he exercised,
c37050	[are] they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c37051	And Omri rested with his fathers
c37052	and was buried in Samaria,
c37053	and his son Ahab reigned in his place.
c37054	In the thirty-eighth year of Asa's reign over Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, ... years.
c37055	and he reigned in Samaria twenty-two
c37056	However, Ahab son of Omri did
c37057	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c37058	more than all
c37059	who were before him.
c37060	And as if it were
c37061	not enough
c37062	for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat,
c37063	he even married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians,
c37064	and then he proceeded
c37065	to serve
c37066	and worship [Baal].
c37067	First, [Ahab] set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal
c37068	that he had built in Samaria.
c37069	Then [he] set up an Asherah pole.
c37070	Thus Ahab ... more
c37071	did
c37072	to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, {to anger} than all the kings of Israel
c37073	before him.
c37074	In [Ahab's] days, Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho.
c37075	At the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation,
c37076	and at the cost of Segub his youngest he set up its gates,
c37077	according to the word the LORD
c37078	had spoken through Joshua son of Nun.
c37079	Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was among the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab,
c37080	“As surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives,
c37081	I stand before Him,
c37082	and in these years there will be neither dew nor rain
c37083	except at my word!”
c37084	Then a revelation from the LORD came to [Elijah]:
c37086	“Leave here,
c37087	turn eastward,
c37088	and hide yourself by the Brook Cherith,
c37089	east of the Jordan.
c37090	And
c37091	you are to drink from the brook,
c37092	and I have commanded the ravens
c37093	to feed you there.”
c37094	and he went
c37095	So [Elijah] did what the LORD had told him,
c37097	and lived by the Brook Cherith,
c37098	east of the Jordan.
c37099	The ravens would bring him bread and meat in the morning
c37100	and evening,
c37101	and he would drink from the brook.
c37102	Some time later, however,
c37103	the brook dried up
c37104	because there had been no rain in the land.
c37105	Then the word of the LORD came to [Elijah]:
c37107	“Get up,
c37108	go to Zarephath
c37109	of Sidon,
c37110	and stay there.
c37111	Behold, I have commanded a widow there
c37112	to provide for you.”
c37113	So Elijah got up
c37114	and went to Zarephath.
c37115	When he arrived at the city gate,
c37116	there was a widow
c37117	gathering sticks.
c37118	Elijah called to
c37119	her and said,
c37120	“Please bring me a little water in a cup,
c37121	so that I may drink.”
c37122	And as she was going
c37123	to get [it],
c37124	he called to her
c37125	and said,
c37126	“Please bring me a piece of bread.”
c37127	But she replied,
c37128	“As surely as the LORD your God lives,
c37129	I have no bread—
c37130	only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug.
c37131	Look, I am gathering a couple of sticks
c37132	to go in
c37133	and prepare for myself and my son,
c37134	so that we may eat it
c37135	and die.”
c37136	Elijah said to her.
c37137	“Do not be afraid,”
c37138	“Go
c37139	as you have said. ... make me
c37140	and do ... But first ... a small cake of bread from [what you have],
c37141	and bring it out to me.
c37142	Afterward, make [some] for yourself and your son,
c37143	for this is what the LORD God of Israel says:
c37144	‘The jar of flour will not be exhausted
c37145	and the jug of oil will not run dry
c37146	until the day
c37147	the LORD sends rain on the face of the earth.”
c37148	So she went
c37149	and did according to the word of Elijah,
c37150	and the woman, Elijah, and her household had food to eat every day.
c37151	The jar of flour was not exhausted
c37152	and the jug of oil did not run dry,
c37153	according to the word the LORD
c37154	had spoken through Elijah.
c37155	Later, ... grew
c37156	the son of the woman who owned the house became ill,
c37157	and his sickness ... severe,
c37158	until no breath remained in him.
c37159	said [the woman] to Elijah,
c37160	“what have you done to me?
c37161	“O man of God,”
c37162	Have you come
c37163	to remind me of my iniquity
c37164	and cause the death of my son?”
c37165	But Elijah said to her,
c37166	“Give me your son.”
c37167	So he took him from her arms,
c37168	carried him to the upper room
c37169	where he was staying,
c37170	and laid him on his own bed.
c37171	Then he cried out to the LORD,
c37173	“O LORD my God,
c37174	have You also ... on this widow
c37175	who has opened her home to me
c37176	brought tragedy
c37177	by causing her son {to die}?”
c37178	Then he stretched himself out over the child three times
c37179	and cried out to the LORD,
c37181	“O LORD my God,
c37182	please let this boy’s life return to him!”
c37183	And the LORD listened to the voice of Elijah,
c37184	and the child’s life returned to him,
c37185	and he lived.
c37186	Then Elijah took the child,
c37187	brought him down from the upper room into the house,
c37188	and gave him to his mother.
c37189	Elijah declared.
c37190	“Look,
c37191	your son is alive,”
c37192	Then the woman said to Elijah,
c37193	“Now I know
c37194	that you are a man of God
c37195	and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is truth.”
c37196	After a long time,
c37197	in the third year [of the drought], the word of the LORD came to Elijah:
c37199	“Go
c37200	and present yourself to Ahab,
c37201	and I will send rain on the face of the earth.”
c37202	So Elijah went
c37203	to present himself to Ahab.
c37204	The famine was severe in Samaria,
c37205	and Ahab summoned Obadiah,
c37206	who was in charge of the palace.
c37207	(Now Obadiah greatly feared the LORD,
c37209	for when Jezebel had slaughtered ... of the LORD, ... prophets
c37210	the prophets ... Obadiah had taken a hundred
c37211	and hidden them,
c37212	fifty men per cave,
c37213	providing them with food and water.)
c37214	Then Ahab said to Obadiah,
c37215	“Go throughout the land to every spring and every valley.
c37216	Perhaps we will find grass
c37217	to keep the horses and mules alive
c37218	so that we will not have to destroy any livestock.”
c37219	So they divided the land
c37220	to explore.
c37221	Ahab went one way by himself,
c37222	and Obadiah went the other way by himself.
c37223	Now as Obadiah went on [his] way,
c37224	Elijah suddenly
c37225	met him.
c37226	When Obadiah recognized him,
c37227	he fell facedown
c37228	and said,
c37229	“Is it you,
c37230	my lord Elijah?”
c37231	he answered.
c37232	“[It is] I,”
c37233	“Go
c37234	tell your master,
c37235	‘Elijah is here!’”
c37236	But Obadiah replied,
c37237	“How have I sinned,
c37238	that you are handing your servant over to Ahab
c37239	to put me to death?
c37240	As surely as the LORD your God lives,
c37241	there is no nation or kingdom
c37242	where my lord has not sent
c37243	someone to search for you.
c37244	When they said,
c37245	‘[He is] not [here],’
c37246	he made that kingdom or nation swear
c37247	they had not found you.
c37248	And now
c37249	you say,
c37250	‘Go
c37251	tell your master [that]
c37252	Elijah is here!’
c37254	when I leave you.
c37255	the Spirit of the LORD may carry you off
c37256	I do not know where
c37257	Then when I go
c37258	[and] tell Ahab
c37259	and he does not find you,
c37260	he will kill me.
c37261	But I, your servant, have feared the LORD from my youth.
c37262	Was it not reported to my lord
c37263	what I did
c37264	when Jezebel slaughtered the prophets of the LORD?
c37265	I hid a hundred prophets of the LORD, ... men
c37266	fifty ... to a cave,
c37267	and I provided them with food and water.
c37268	And now
c37269	you say,
c37270	‘Go
c37271	tell your lord
c37272	that Elijah is here!’
c37273	He will kill me!”
c37274	Then Elijah said,
c37275	“As surely as the LORD of Hosts lives,
c37276	before whom I stand,
c37277	I will present myself to Ahab today.”
c37278	So Obadiah went
c37279	to ... Ahab,
c37280	inform
c37281	[who] went
c37282	to meet Elijah.
c37284	When Ahab saw Elijah,
c37285	[he] said to him,
c37286	“Is that you,
c37287	O troubler of Israel?”
c37288	[Elijah] replied,
c37289	“I have not troubled Israel,”
c37290	“but you and your father’s house [have],
c37291	for you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD
c37292	and have followed the Baals.
c37293	Now
c37294	summon
c37295	all Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel,
c37296	along with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal
c37297	and four hundred prophets of Asherah
c37298	who eat at Jezebel’s table.”
c37299	So Ahab summoned all the Israelites
c37300	and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.
c37301	Then Elijah approached all the people
c37302	and said,
c37303	“How long will you waver between two opinions?
c37304	If the LORD is God,
c37305	follow Him.
c37306	But if Baal [is],
c37307	follow him.”
c37308	But the people did not answer a word.
c37309	Then Elijah said to the people,
c37310	“I am the only remaining prophet of the LORD,
c37311	but Baal [has] four hundred and fifty prophets.
c37312	Get two bulls for us.
c37313	Let [the prophets of Baal] choose one bull for themselves,
c37314	cut it into pieces,
c37315	and place it on the wood,
c37316	but not light the fire.
c37317	And I will prepare the other bull
c37318	and place it on the wood,
c37319	but not light the fire.
c37320	Then you may call on the name of your god,
c37321	and I will call on the name of the LORD.
c37322	is
c37323	The God
c37324	who answers by fire,
c37325	He ... God.”
c37326	And all the people
c37327	answered,
c37328	“What you say is good.”
c37329	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal,
c37330	choose for yourselves one bull
c37331	and prepare it first.
c37332	“Since you are so numerous,
c37333	Then call on the name of your god,
c37334	but do not light the fire.”
c37335	And they took the bull
c37336	that was given them,
c37337	prepared [it],
c37338	and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon,
c37339	shouting,
c37340	“O Baal,
c37341	answer us!”
c37342	But there was no sound,
c37343	and no one answered
c37344	as they leaped around the altar
c37345	they had made.
c37346	At noon
c37347	Elijah began to taunt them,
c37348	saying,
c37349	“Shout louder,
c37350	for he is a god!
c37351	Perhaps he is deep in thought,
c37352	or occupied,
c37353	or on a journey.
c37354	Perhaps he is sleeping
c37355	and must be awakened!”
c37356	So they shouted louder
c37357	and cut themselves with knives and lances, as [was] their custom,
c37358	until the blood gushed out upon them.
c37360	Midday passed,
c37361	and they kept on raving
c37362	until the [time] of the [evening] sacrifice.
c37363	But [there was] no response,
c37364	no one answered,
c37365	no one paid attention.
c37366	Then Elijah said to all the people,
c37367	“Come near to me.”
c37368	So all the people approached him,
c37369	and he repaired the altar of the LORD
c37370	that had been torn down.
c37371	And Elijah took twelve stones— one for each tribe of Jacob's descendants
c37372	to whom the word of the LORD had come
c37373	and said,
c37374	“Israel shall be your name.”
c37375	And with the stones, [Elijah] built an altar in the name of the LORD.
c37376	Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.
c37377	Next, he arranged the wood,
c37378	cut up the bull,
c37379	placed it on the wood,
c37380	and said,
c37381	“Fill four waterpots
c37382	and pour [the water] on the offering and on the wood.”
c37383	he said,
c37384	“Do [it] a second time,”
c37385	and they did it a second time.
c37386	he said,
c37387	“Do [it] a third time,”
c37388	and they did it a third time.
c37389	So the water ran down around the altar
c37390	and even filled the trench.
c37392	At the time of the evening sacrifice,
c37393	Elijah the prophet approached
c37394	the altar and said,
c37395	“O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
c37396	let it be known this day
c37397	that You are God in Israel
c37398	and that I [am] Your servant
c37399	and have done all these things at Your command.
c37400	Answer me,
c37401	O LORD!
c37402	Answer me,
c37403	so that this people will know
c37404	that You, the LORD, are God,
c37405	and that You have turned their hearts back again.”
c37406	Then the fire of the LORD fell
c37407	and consumed the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, and the dust,
c37408	the water
c37409	in the trench.
c37410	and it licked up
c37411	When all the people saw this,
c37412	they fell facedown
c37413	and said,
c37414	“The LORD,
c37415	He is God!
c37416	The LORD,
c37417	He is God!”
c37418	ordered them, ... and Elijah
c37419	“Seize the prophets of Baal!
c37420	Do not let a single one escape.”
c37421	So they seized them,
c37422	Then Elijah ... brought them down to the Kishon Valley
c37423	and slaughtered them there.
c37424	And Elijah said to Ahab,
c37425	“Go up,
c37426	eat
c37427	and drink,
c37428	for there is the sound of a heavy rain.”
c37429	So Ahab went up
c37430	to eat
c37431	and drink.
c37432	But Elijah climbed to the summit of Carmel,
c37433	bent down on the ground,
c37434	and put his face between his knees.
c37435	he said to his servant.
c37436	“Go
c37437	and look toward the sea,”
c37438	So [the servant] went
c37439	and looked,
c37440	and he said,
c37441	“[There is] nothing there.”
c37442	Elijah said,
c37443	“Go back.”
c37444	Seven times
c37445	On the seventh time
c37446	[the servant] reported,
c37447	“There is a cloud as small as a man’s hand rising from the sea.”
c37448	And Elijah replied,
c37449	“Go
c37450	and tell Ahab,
c37451	‘Prepare [your chariot]
c37452	and go down
c37453	before the rain stops you.’”
c37454	Meanwhile,
c37455	the sky grew dark with clouds and wind,
c37456	and a heavy rain began to fall.
c37457	So Ahab rode away
c37458	and went to Jezreel.
c37459	And the hand of the LORD came upon Elijah,
c37460	and he tucked his cloak into his belt
c37461	and ran ahead of Ahab
c37462	all the way to Jezreel.
c37463	Now Ahab told Jezebel everything
c37464	that Elijah had done
c37465	all
c37466	and how he had killed ... the prophets with the sword.
c37467	So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah,
c37468	saying,
c37469	“May the gods deal with me,
c37470	and ever so severely,
c37471	if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like the lives of [those you killed]!”
c37472	And Elijah was afraid
c37474	and ran for his life.
c37475	When he came to Beersheba
c37476	in Judah,
c37477	he left his servant there,
c37478	while he himself traveled on a day’s journey into the wilderness.
c37480	He sat down under a broom tree
c37481	and prayed ... my life,
c37482	might die.
c37483	he said.
c37484	“I have had enough,
c37485	LORD,”
c37486	that he ... “Take
c37487	for I am no better than my fathers.”
c37488	Then he lay down
c37489	under the broom tree and fell asleep.
c37490	Suddenly
c37491	an angel touched him
c37492	and said,
c37493	“Get up
c37494	and eat.”
c37495	And he looked around,
c37496	and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water.
c37497	So he ate
c37498	and drank
c37499	again.
c37500	and lay down
c37501	A second [time] the angel of the LORD returned
c37502	and touched him,
c37503	saying,
c37504	“Get up
c37505	and eat,
c37506	or the journey will be too much for you.”
c37507	So he got up
c37508	and ate
c37509	and drank.
c37510	And strengthened by that food, he walked forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.
c37511	Elijah entered a cave
c37512	There ... and spent the night.
c37513	And the word of the LORD came to him,
c37514	saying,
c37515	“What are you doing here,
c37516	Elijah?”
c37517	he replied,
c37518	“I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of Hosts,”
c37519	“but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant,
c37520	torn down Your altars,
c37521	and killed Your prophets with the sword.
c37522	I am the only one left,
c37523	and they are seeking my life {as well}.”
c37525	Then [the LORD] said,
c37526	“Go out
c37527	and stand on the mountain before the LORD.
c37528	Behold, the LORD is about to pass by.”
c37529	And a great and mighty wind
c37530	tore into the mountains
c37531	and shattered the rocks
c37532	before the LORD,
c37533	but the LORD was not in the wind.
c37534	After the wind there was an earthquake,
c37535	but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
c37536	After the earthquake ... in the fire.
c37537	there was a fire, but the LORD was not
c37538	And after the fire came a still, small voice.
c37540	When Elijah heard it,
c37541	he wrapped his face in his cloak
c37542	and went out
c37543	and stood at the mouth of the cave.
c37544	Suddenly a voice [came] to him
c37545	and said,
c37546	“What are you doing here,
c37547	Elijah?”
c37548	he replied,
c37549	“I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of Hosts,”
c37550	“but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant,
c37551	torn down Your altars,
c37552	and killed Your prophets with the sword.
c37553	I am the only one left,
c37554	and they are seeking my life {as well}.”
c37556	Then the LORD said to him,
c37557	“Go
c37558	back by the way you came, to the Desert of Damascus.
c37559	When you arrive,
c37560	you are to anoint Hazael as king over Aram.
c37561	You are also to anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel
c37562	and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet.
c37563	Then
c37564	whoever escapes the sword of Hazael,
c37565	Jehu will put to death
c37567	whoever escapes the sword of Jehu.
c37568	and Elisha will put to death
c37569	Nevertheless, I have reserved seven thousand in Israel—
c37570	all ... knees
c37571	whose ... have not bowed to Baal
c37572	and [whose] mouths
c37573	have not kissed him.”
c37574	So Elijah departed
c37575	and found Elisha son of Shaphat.
c37576	He was plowing
c37577	with twelve teams [of oxen],
c37578	and he was with the twelfth [team].
c37579	Elijah passed by him
c37580	and threw his cloak around him.
c37581	So Elisha left the oxen,
c37582	ran after Elijah,
c37583	and said,
c37584	“Please let me kiss my father and mother [goodbye],
c37585	and then I will follow you.”
c37586	[Elijah] replied,
c37587	“Go on
c37588	back,”
c37589	“for what have I done to you?”
c37590	So [Elisha] turned back from him,
c37591	took his pair of oxen,
c37592	and slaughtered them.
c37593	With the oxen’s equipment, he cooked the meat
c37594	and gave it to the people,
c37595	and they ate.
c37596	Then he set out
c37597	to follow ... Elijah.
c37598	and serve
c37599	Now Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots,
c37600	he marched up,
c37601	besieged Samaria,
c37602	and waged war against it.
c37603	Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel,
c37604	saying, “This is what
c37605	Ben-hadad says:
c37606	‘Your silver and gold
c37607	are mine,
c37608	and your best wives and children
c37609	are mine!’”
c37610	And the king of Israel replied,
c37612	“Just as you say,
c37613	my lord the king:
c37614	I am yours, along with all
c37615	that I have.”
c37616	The messengers came back
c37617	and said,
c37618	“This is what Ben-hadad says:
c37619	to demand
c37620	‘I have sent to you
c37622	your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children.
c37623	But about this time tomorrow I will send my servants
c37624	to search your palace and the houses of your servants.
c37625	is
c37626	They will seize ... all that ... precious to you.’”
c37627	and take away
c37628	Then the king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land
c37629	and said,
c37630	“Please take note,
c37631	and you will see
c37632	that this [man] is looking for trouble,
c37633	for when he demanded my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold,
c37634	I did not deny him.”
c37635	And the elders and the people all said,
c37636	“Do not listen
c37637	or consent to his terms.”
c37638	So [Ahab] answered the messengers of Ben-hadad,
c37639	“Tell my lord the king,
c37640	‘All
c37641	that you demanded of your servant the first time
c37642	I will do,
c37643	but this thing I cannot
c37644	do.’”
c37645	So the messengers departed
c37646	and relayed the message to [Ben-hadad].
c37647	Then Ben-hadad sent ... to [Ahab]:
c37648	another message
c37649	“May the gods deal with me,
c37650	and ever so severely,
c37651	if [enough] dust remains of Samaria for each of my men [to have] a handful.”
c37653	And the king of Israel replied,
c37655	“Tell him:
c37656	should not boast
c37657	‘The one putting on [his armor]
c37658	like one taking [it off].’”
c37660	Ben-hadad received this message
c37661	while he and the kings were drinking in their tents,
c37662	and he said to his servants,
c37663	“Take your positions.”
c37664	So they stationed themselves against the city.
c37665	Meanwhile
c37666	a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel
c37667	and declared,
c37668	“This is what the LORD says:
c37669	‘Do you see this entire great army?
c37670	Behold, I will deliver it into your hand this very day,
c37671	and you will know
c37672	that I am the LORD.’”
c37673	Ahab asked.
c37674	“By whom?”
c37675	And the prophet replied,
c37676	“This is what the LORD says:
c37677	‘By the young officers of the district governors.’”
c37678	asked [Ahab].
c37679	“Who will start the battle?”
c37680	answered the prophet.
c37681	“You [will],”
c37682	So Ahab assembled the young officers of the district governors,
c37683	and there were 232men.
c37684	And after them, he assembled [the rest of] the Israelite troops, 7,000 in all.
c37685	They marched out at noon
c37686	while Ben-hadad ... were in their tents getting drunk.
c37687	and the 32 kings
c37688	allied with him
c37689	And the young officers of the district governors marched out first.
c37690	Now Ben-hadad had sent out scouts,
c37691	who reported to him,
c37693	“Men are marching out of Samaria.”
c37694	he said,
c37695	“If they have marched out in peace,”
c37696	“take them alive.
c37697	Or if they have marched out for war,
c37698	take them alive.”
c37699	Meanwhile, these young officers of the district governors marched out of the city, with the army
c37700	behind them,
c37701	and each one struck down his opponent.
c37702	So the Arameans fled,
c37703	with the Israelites in pursuit.
c37704	But Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with the cavalry.
c37705	Then the king of Israel marched out
c37706	and attacked the horses and chariots,
c37707	inflicting a great slaughter on the Arameans.
c37708	Afterward, the prophet approached the king of Israel
c37709	and said,
c37710	“Go
c37711	and strengthen [your position],
c37712	and take note
c37714	what you must do,
c37715	for in the spring the king of Aram will march against you.”
c37716	Meanwhile, the servants of the king of Aram said to him,
c37717	“Their gods [are] gods of the hills.
c37718	That is why ... over us. ... we will prevail.
c37719	Instead, we should fight them on the plains;
c37720	they prevailed ... surely then
c37721	So do this:
c37722	Dismiss ... the kings
c37723	all ... from their positions
c37724	and replace them with other officers.
c37725	And you must raise an army like the [one]
c37726	you have lost—
c37727	horse for horse and chariot for chariot—
c37728	so we can fight [the Israelites] on the plain,
c37729	where we will surely prevail.
c37730	And [the king] approved their plan
c37731	and acted accordingly.
c37732	In the spring,
c37733	Ben-hadad mobilized the Arameans
c37734	and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
c37735	The Israelites also mobilized,
c37736	gathered supplies,
c37737	and marched out
c37738	to meet them.
c37739	The Israelites camped before them like two small flocks of goats,
c37740	while the Arameans covered the countryside.
c37741	Then the man of God approached
c37742	the king of Israel and said,
c37743	says:
c37744	“This is what ... think the LORD
c37745	‘Because the Arameans
c37746	the LORD ... is a god of the hills
c37747	and not of the valleys,
c37748	I will deliver all this great army into your hand.
c37749	Then you will know
c37750	that I am the LORD.’”
c37751	For seven days [the armies] camped opposite each other,
c37752	and on the seventh day
c37753	the battle ensued,
c37754	and the Israelites struck down the Arameans— a hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day.
c37755	The rest of them fled into the city of Aphek,
c37756	where the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand ... men.
c37757	of the remaining
c37758	Ben-hadad also fled
c37759	to the city and hid in an inner room.
c37760	Then the servants of [Ben-hadad] said to him,
c37761	“Look now, we have heard
c37762	that the kings of the house of Israel
c37763	are merciful.
c37764	[with] sackcloth around our waists
c37765	and ropes around our heads.
c37766	Let us go out to the king of Israel
c37767	Perhaps he will spare your life.”
c37768	So [with] sackcloth around their waists
c37769	and ropes around their heads,
c37770	they went to the king of Israel
c37771	and said,
c37772	“Your servant Ben-hadad says,
c37773	‘Please spare my life.’”
c37774	And [the king] answered,
c37775	“Is he still alive?
c37776	He is my brother.”
c37777	Now the men were looking for a sign of hope,
c37778	and they quickly
c37779	grasped [at this word]
c37781	and replied,
c37782	“Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.”
c37783	said [the king].
c37784	“Go
c37785	and get him!”
c37786	Then Ben-hadad came out,
c37787	and Ahab had him come up into his chariot.
c37788	Ben-hadad said to him,
c37789	the cities
c37790	my father took from your father;
c37791	“I will restore
c37792	you may set up your own marketplaces in Damascus,
c37793	as my father [did] in Samaria.”
c37794	“By this covenant I release you ,” [Ahab replied].
c37795	So he made a treaty with him
c37796	and sent him away.
c37797	Meanwhile, by the word of the LORD, one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion,
c37798	“Strike me, please!”
c37799	But [the man] refused
c37800	to strike him.
c37801	Then [the prophet] said to him,
c37802	“Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD,
c37803	as soon as you depart from me
c37804	a lion will kill you.”
c37805	And when he left,
c37806	a lion found him
c37807	and killed him.
c37808	Then the prophet found another man
c37809	and said,
c37810	“Strike me, please!”
c37811	So the man struck him and wounded him,
c37812	and the prophet went
c37813	and waited on the road for the king,
c37814	disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.
c37816	As the king passed by,
c37817	he cried out to the king:
c37819	“Your servant had marched out into the middle of the battle,
c37820	when suddenly a man came over
c37821	with a captive ... me,
c37822	and told
c37823	‘Guard this man!
c37824	If he goes missing for any reason,
c37825	your life will be exchanged for his life,
c37826	or you will weigh out a talent of silver.’
c37827	was
c37828	But while your servant ... busy here and there,
c37829	[the man]
c37830	disappeared.”
c37831	And the king of Israel said to him,
c37832	“So [shall] your judgment [be];
c37833	you have pronounced it on yourself.”
c37834	Then [the prophet] quickly
c37835	removed the bandage from his eyes,
c37836	and the king of Israel recognized him
c37837	as one of the prophets.
c37838	And [the prophet] said to [the king],
c37839	“This is what the LORD says:
c37840	‘Because you have let slip from your hand the man I had set apart for destruction,
c37841	your life will be exchanged for his life,
c37842	and your people for his people.’”
c37843	Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went home
c37844	to Samaria.
c37845	Some time later, ... happened
c37846	Naboth the Jezreelite ... to own a vineyard
c37847	in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
c37848	So Ahab said to Naboth,
c37850	“Give me your vineyard
c37851	to use as a vegetable garden,
c37852	since it is next to my palace.
c37853	I will give you ... vineyard in its place—
c37854	a better
c37855	or if you prefer,
c37856	I will give you its value in silver.”
c37857	But Naboth replied,
c37858	“The LORD forbid
c37859	that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.”
c37860	So Ahab went to his palace,
c37861	sullen and angry because
c37862	Naboth the Jezreelite had told him,
c37864	“I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.”
c37865	He lay down on his bed,
c37866	turned his face away,
c37867	and refused to eat.
c37868	Soon his wife Jezebel came in
c37869	and asked,
c37870	“Why are you so sullen
c37871	that you refuse to eat?”
c37872	Ahab answered,
c37873	“Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite
c37874	and told him,
c37875	‘Give me your vineyard for silver,
c37876	or
c37877	if you wish,
c37878	I will give you [another] vineyard in its place.’
c37879	And he said,
c37880	‘I will not give you my vineyard!’”
c37881	But his wife Jezebel said to him,
c37882	“Do you not reign over Israel?
c37883	Get up,
c37884	eat some food,
c37885	and be cheerful,
c37886	for I will get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
c37887	Then [Jezebel] wrote letters in Ahab’s name,
c37888	sealed them with his seal,
c37889	and sent [them] to the elders and nobles
c37890	who ... in his city.
c37891	lived with Naboth
c37892	In the letters she wrote:
c37894	“Proclaim a fast
c37895	and give Naboth a seat of honor among the people.
c37896	But seat two scoundrels opposite him
c37897	and have them testify,
c37899	‘You have cursed [both] God and the king!’
c37900	Then take him out
c37901	and stone
c37902	him to death.”
c37903	So the elders and nobles ... did
c37904	who lived in [Naboth's] city
c37905	as Jezebel had instructed
c37906	in the letters
c37907	she had written to them.
c37908	They proclaimed a fast
c37909	and gave Naboth a seat of honor among the people.
c37910	And the two scoundrels came in
c37911	and sat opposite [Naboth],
c37912	and [these men] testified against [him] before the people,
c37913	saying,
c37914	“Naboth has cursed God and the king!”
c37915	So they took him outside the city
c37916	and stoned him
c37917	to death.
c37918	Then they sent word to Jezebel:
c37920	“Naboth has been stoned
c37921	to death.”
c37923	heard ... she
c37924	that Naboth had been stoned
c37925	to death,
c37926	When Jezebel ... said to Ahab,
c37927	“Get up
c37928	and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
c37929	who refused
c37930	to give it to you for silver.
c37931	For Naboth is no longer alive,
c37932	but dead.”
c37933	And
c37934	when Ahab heard
c37935	that Naboth was dead,
c37936	he got up
c37937	[and] went down ... the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
c37938	to take possession of
c37939	Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite,
c37940	saying,
c37941	“Get up
c37942	and go down
c37943	to meet Ahab king of Israel,
c37944	who is in Samaria.
c37945	See, [he is] in the vineyard of Naboth,
c37946	of which he has gone
c37947	to take possession.
c37948	Tell him
c37949	says:
c37950	that this is what the LORD ... says:
c37951	‘Have you not murdered [a man]
c37952	and seized his land?’
c37953	Then tell him
c37955	that this is [also] what the LORD
c37956	‘In the place
c37957	where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth,
c37958	[there also] the dogs will lick up your blood— yes, yours!’”
c37959	When Elijah [arrived], Ahab said to him,
c37960	“So you have found me out,
c37961	my enemy.”
c37962	He replied,
c37963	“I have found [you] out
c37964	because you have sold yourself
c37965	to do
c37966	evil in the sight of the LORD.
c37967	[This is what the LORD says]: ‘I will bring calamity on you
c37968	and consume your descendants;
c37969	I will cut off from Ahab
c37970	every male
c37971	in Israel, both slave and free.
c37972	I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like that of Baasha son of Ahijah,
c37973	because ... My anger
c37974	you have provoked
c37975	and caused Israel to sin.’
c37976	And the LORD also speaks concerning Jezebel:
c37978	‘The dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.’
c37979	He who belongs to Ahab and dies in the city
c37980	will be eaten by dogs,
c37982	and he who dies in the field
c37983	will be eaten by the birds of the air.’”
c37984	(Surely there was never one like Ahab,
c37985	who sold himself
c37986	to do
c37987	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c37988	incited by his wife Jezebel.
c37989	He committed the most detestable acts
c37990	by going after idols,
c37991	like
c37992	the Amorites
c37993	the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.)
c37995	When Ahab heard these words,
c37996	he tore his clothes,
c37997	put on sackcloth,
c37998	and fasted.
c37999	He lay down in sackcloth
c38000	and walked around meekly.
c38001	Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite,
c38002	saying:
c38003	“Have you seen
c38004	how Ahab has humbled himself before Me?
c38005	Because he has humbled himself before Me,
c38006	I will not bring the calamity ... in the days
c38007	during his days, but I will bring [it] upon his house ... of his son.”
c38008	Then three years passed
c38009	without war between Aram and Israel.
c38010	However, in the third year,
c38011	Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to [visit] the king of Israel,
c38012	[who] said to his servants,
c38013	“Do you not know
c38014	that Ramoth-gilead is ours,
c38015	but we have failed
c38016	to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?”
c38017	So he asked Jehoshaphat,
c38018	“Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth-gilead?”
c38019	Jehoshaphat answered the king of Israel,
c38020	“I [am] as you [are],
c38021	my people as your people,
c38022	[and] my horses as your horses.”
c38023	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel,
c38024	“Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.”
c38025	So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men,
c38026	and asked them,
c38027	“Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead,
c38028	or should I refrain?”
c38029	they replied,
c38030	“Go up,”
c38031	“and the Lord will deliver [it] into the hand of the king.”
c38032	But Jehoshaphat asked,
c38033	“Is [there] not still a prophet of the LORD here
c38034	of whom we can inquire?”
c38035	The king of Israel answered,
c38036	“There is still one man
c38037	who can ask the LORD,
c38038	but I hate him
c38039	he never prophesies anything good for me, but only
c38040	because ... bad.
c38041	He is Micaiah son of Imlah.”
c38042	say ... Jehoshaphat
c38043	“The king should not ... that!” ... replied.
c38044	So the king of Israel called one of his officials
c38045	and said,
c38046	“Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah {at once}.”
c38047	the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting
c38048	on their thrones
c38049	Dressed in royal attire,
c38050	at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria,
c38051	with all the prophets prophesying before them.
c38052	Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for himself iron horns
c38053	and declared,
c38054	“This is what the LORD says:
c38055	‘With these you shall gore the Arameans
c38056	until they are finished off.’”
c38057	And all the prophets were prophesying the same,
c38058	saying,
c38059	“Go up to Ramoth-gilead
c38060	and prosper,
c38061	for the LORD will deliver [it] into the hand of the king.”
c38062	Then the messenger
c38063	who had gone
c38064	to call Micaiah
c38065	instructed him,
c38067	“Behold now, with one accord the words of the prophets are favorable to the king.
c38068	So please let your words be like theirs,
c38069	and speak favorably.”
c38070	But Micaiah said,
c38071	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c38073	whatever the LORD tells me.”
c38074	I will speak
c38075	When Micaiah arrived,
c38076	the king asked him,
c38077	“Micaiah,
c38078	should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead,
c38079	or should we refrain?”
c38080	Micaiah replied,
c38081	“Go up
c38082	and triumph,”
c38083	“for the LORD will give [it] into the hand of the king.”
c38084	But the king said to him,
c38085	“How many times must I make you swear
c38086	not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
c38087	So Micaiah declared:
c38088	“I saw all Israel
c38089	scattered on the hills
c38090	like sheep
c38091	without a shepherd.
c38092	And the LORD said,
c38093	‘These [people] have no master;
c38094	return
c38095	let each one ... home
c38096	in peace.’”
c38097	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
c38098	“Did I not tell you
c38099	that he never prophesies good for me,
c38100	but only bad?”
c38101	Micaiah continued,
c38102	“Therefore hear the word of the LORD:
c38103	I saw the LORD
c38104	sitting on His throne,
c38105	and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and on His left.
c38106	And the LORD said,
c38107	‘Who will entice Ahab
c38108	to march up
c38109	and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’
c38110	And one suggested this,
c38111	and another that.
c38112	Then a spirit came forward,
c38113	stood before the LORD,
c38115	‘I will entice him.’
c38116	and said, ... asked the LORD.
c38117	‘By what means?’
c38118	And he replied,
c38119	‘I will go out
c38120	and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’
c38121	said [the LORD].
c38122	entice him
c38123	‘You will surely ... and prevail,’
c38124	‘Go
c38125	and do it.’
c38126	So
c38127	you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours,
c38128	and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you.”
c38129	Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up,
c38130	struck Micaiah in the face,
c38131	and demanded,
c38132	“Which way did the Spirit of the LORD [go] when He departed from me
c38133	to speak to you?”
c38134	Micaiah replied,
c38135	“You will soon see, on that day
c38136	when you go ... in an inner room.”
c38137	[and] hide
c38138	And the king of Israel declared,
c38139	“Take Micaiah
c38140	and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son,
c38141	and tell them
c38142	that this is what the king says:
c38143	‘Put this [man] in prison
c38144	and feed him only bread and water
c38145	until I return safely.’”
c38146	But Micaiah replied,
c38147	“If you ever return safely,
c38148	the LORD has not spoken through me.”
c38149	Then he added,
c38150	“Take heed,
c38151	all you people!”
c38152	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
c38153	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
c38154	“I will disguise
c38155	myself and go into battle,
c38156	but you wear your royal robes.”
c38157	So the king of Israel disguised himself
c38158	and went into battle.
c38159	Now the king of Aram had ordered ... chariot commanders,
c38161	his thirty-two
c38163	“Do not fight with anyone, small or great,
c38164	except the king of Israel.”
c38166	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat,
c38167	they said,
c38168	“Surely this is the king of Israel!”
c38169	So they turned ... against him,
c38170	to fight
c38171	but Jehoshaphat cried out.
c38172	And
c38173	when the chariot commanders saw
c38174	that he was not the king of Israel,
c38175	they turned back from pursuing him.
c38176	However, a [certain] man drew his bow without taking special aim,
c38177	and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor.
c38178	So [the king] said to his charioteer,
c38179	“Turn around
c38180	and take me out of the battle,
c38181	for I am badly wounded!”
c38182	The battle raged throughout that day,
c38183	and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans.
c38184	and that evening he died.
c38185	And the blood from his wound ran out onto the floor of the chariot,
c38186	the cry rang out in the army:
c38187	As the sun was setting,
c38189	“Every man to his own city,
c38190	and every man to his own land!”
c38191	So the king died
c38192	and was brought to Samaria,
c38193	where they buried [him].
c38194	And [someone] washed the chariot at the pool of Samaria
c38195	and the dogs licked up [Ahab's] blood,
c38196	where the prostitutes bathed,
c38197	according to the word that the LORD
c38198	had spoken.
c38199	As for the rest of the acts of Ahab, along with all
c38200	his accomplishments
c38201	and the ivory palace
c38203	and all the cities
c38204	he built,
c38205	[are] they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c38206	And Ahab rested with his fathers,
c38207	and his son Ahaziah reigned in his place.
c38208	In the fourth year of Ahab's reign over Israel, Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah.
c38209	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old
c38210	when he became king,
c38211	and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years.
c38212	His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
c38213	And [Jehoshaphat] walked in all the ways of his father Asa;
c38214	he did not turn away from them,
c38215	but did
c38216	what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
c38217	The high places, however, were not removed;
c38218	the people still sacrificed
c38219	and burned incense on the high places.
c38220	Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
c38221	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, along with the might
c38222	he exercised and how
c38223	he waged war,
c38224	[are] they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c38225	[any] male cult prostitutes
c38226	who had remained from the days of his father Asa.
c38227	He banished from the land
c38228	And there was no king in Edom;
c38229	a deputy served as king.
c38230	Jehoshaphat built ships of Tarshish
c38231	to go to Ophir for gold,
c38232	but they never set sail,
c38233	because [they] were wrecked at Ezion-geber.
c38234	At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat,
c38235	“Let my servants sail with your servants,”
c38236	but Jehoshaphat refused.
c38237	And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers
c38238	and was buried with them in the city of his father David,
c38239	and his son Jehoram reigned in his place.
c38240	In the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat's reign over Judah, Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel, ... in Samaria
c38241	and he reigned ... two years.
c38242	And he did
c38243	evil in the sight of the LORD
c38244	and walked in the ways of his father [and] mother, [and] of Jeroboam son of Nebat,
c38245	who had caused Israel to sin.
c38246	[Ahaziah] served ... Baal,
c38247	and worshiped
c38248	provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, {to anger}, just as
c38249	his father had done.
c38250	After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.
c38251	Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room
c38252	in Samaria
c38253	and injured himself.
c38254	So he sent messengers
c38255	and instructed them:
c38256	“Go
c38257	inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron,
c38258	whether I will recover from this injury.”
c38259	But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite,
c38261	“Go up
c38262	to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria
c38263	and ask them,
c38264	‘[Is [it] because [there is] no God in Israel
c38265	that you are on your way
c38266	to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?’
c38267	Therefore,
c38268	this is what the LORD says:
c38269	the bed
c38270	on which you are lying.
c38271	‘You will not get up from
c38272	You will surely die.’”
c38273	So Elijah departed.
c38274	When the messengers returned to the king,
c38275	he asked them,
c38276	“Why have you returned?”
c38277	They replied,
c38278	“A man came up
c38279	to meet us
c38280	and said,
c38281	‘Go
c38282	back to the king
c38283	who sent you
c38284	and tell him
c38285	that this is what the LORD says:
c38286	there is no God in Israel
c38287	that you are sending
c38288	these men to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?
c38289	Therefore
c38290	from the bed
c38291	on which you are lying.
c38292	Is it because ... you will not get up
c38293	You will surely die.’”
c38294	The king asked them,
c38295	“What sort of man
c38296	came up
c38297	to meet
c38298	you and spoke these words to you?”
c38299	they answered,
c38300	“[He was] a hairy man,”
c38301	“with a leather belt around his waist.”
c38302	said [the king].
c38303	“It is Elijah the Tishbite,”
c38304	Then King Ahaziah sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men.
c38305	So the captain went up to [Elijah],
c38306	who was sitting on top of a hill,
c38307	and said to him,
c38308	“Man of God,
c38309	the king declares,
c38310	‘Come down!’”
c38311	Elijah answered
c38312	the captain,
c38313	“If I am a man of God,
c38314	may fire come down from heaven
c38315	and consume you and [your] fifty [men].”
c38316	And fire came down from heaven
c38317	and consumed [the captain] and his men.
c38319	So the king sent to Elijah another captain [with his] fifty [men].
c38320	And [the captain]
c38321	said to [Elijah],
c38322	“Man of God,
c38323	the king declares,
c38324	‘Come down at once!’”
c38325	Again Elijah replied,
c38327	“If I am a man of God,
c38328	may fire come down from heaven
c38329	and consume you and [your] fifty [men].”
c38330	And the fire of God came down from heaven
c38331	and consumed him and [his] fifty men.
c38332	So
c38333	the king sent a third captain
c38334	went up,
c38335	with his fifty men. And the third captain
c38336	fell on his knees before Elijah,
c38337	and begged him,
c38339	“Man of God,
c38340	may my life and the lives of these fifty servants please be precious in your sight.
c38341	Behold, fire has come down from heaven
c38342	and consumed the first two captains of fifty, with all their men.
c38343	But now
c38344	may my life be precious in your sight.”
c38345	Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah,
c38346	“Go down with him.
c38347	Do not be afraid of him.”
c38348	So [Elijah] arose
c38349	and went down with him to the king.
c38350	And Elijah said to King Ahaziah,
c38351	“This is what the LORD says:
c38352	Is that why you have sent messengers
c38353	to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?
c38354	‘Is there really no God in Israel
c38355	for you to inquire of His word?
c38356	Therefore
c38357	the bed
c38358	on which you are lying.
c38359	you will not get up from
c38360	You will surely die.’”
c38361	So [Ahaziah] died according to the word of the LORD
c38362	that Elijah had spoken.
c38363	son, Jehoram succeeded him in the second year of the reign of Jehoram ... of Jehoshaphat over Judah.
c38364	Since he had no ... son
c38365	As for the rest of the acts of Ahaziah,
c38366	along with his accomplishments,
c38367	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c38368	Shortly before
c38369	the LORD took Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind,
c38370	Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal,
c38371	and Elijah said to Elisha,
c38372	“Please stay here,
c38373	for the LORD has sent me on to Bethel.”
c38374	But Elisha replied,
c38375	“As surely as the LORD lives
c38376	and as you yourself live,
c38377	I will not leave you.”
c38378	So they went down to Bethel.
c38379	Then the sons of the prophets ... came out
c38380	at Bethel
c38381	to Elisha
c38382	and said,
c38383	“Do you know
c38384	that the LORD will take your master away from you today?”
c38385	he replied.
c38386	“Yes, I know,”
c38387	“Do not speak [of it].”
c38388	And Elijah said to
c38389	Elisha,
c38390	“Please stay here,
c38391	for the LORD has sent me on to Jericho.”
c38392	But Elisha replied,
c38393	“As surely as the LORD lives
c38394	and as you yourself live,
c38395	I will not leave you.”
c38396	So they went to Jericho.
c38397	Then the sons of the prophets ... came up
c38398	at Jericho
c38399	to Elisha
c38400	and said,
c38401	“Do you know
c38402	that the LORD will take your master away from you today?”
c38403	he replied.
c38404	“Yes, I know,”
c38405	“Do not speak [of it].”
c38406	And Elijah said to [Elisha],
c38407	“Please stay here,
c38408	for the LORD has sent me on to the Jordan.”
c38409	But Elisha replied,
c38410	“As surely as the LORD lives
c38411	and as you yourself live,
c38412	I will not leave you.”
c38413	So the two of them went on.
c38414	Then a company of fifty of the sons of the prophets went
c38415	and stood at a distance, facing [Elijah and Elisha]
c38416	as the two of them stood by the Jordan.
c38417	And Elijah took his cloak,
c38418	rolled it up,
c38419	and struck the waters,
c38420	which parted to the right and to the left,
c38421	so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
c38422	After
c38423	they had crossed over,
c38424	Elijah said to Elisha,
c38425	“Tell me,
c38426	what can I do for you
c38427	before I am taken away from you?”
c38428	Elisha replied.
c38429	“Please, let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,”
c38430	said Elijah.
c38431	a difficult thing,”
c38432	“You have requested
c38433	“[Nevertheless,] if you see me
c38434	as I am taken from you,
c38435	it will be yours.
c38436	But if not,
c38437	then it will not be [so].”
c38439	As they were walking along and talking together,
c38440	suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire
c38441	appeared and separated the two of them,
c38442	and Elijah went up into heaven in a whirlwind.
c38443	As Elisha watched,
c38444	he cried out,
c38445	“My father, my father,
c38446	the chariots and horsemen of Israel!”
c38447	And he saw [Elijah] no more.
c38448	So taking hold of his own clothes,
c38449	he tore them in two.
c38450	Elisha also picked up the cloak ... Elijah,
c38451	that had fallen from
c38452	and he went back
c38453	and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
c38454	Then he took the cloak of Elijah
c38455	that had fallen from him
c38456	and struck the waters.
c38457	he asked.
c38458	“Where now [is] the LORD, the God of Elijah?”
c38459	And when he had struck the waters,
c38460	they parted to the right and to the left,
c38461	and Elisha crossed over.
c38462	When the sons of the prophets ... saw what had happened,
c38463	who [were] ... from Jericho
c38464	facing him
c38465	they said,
c38466	“The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.”
c38467	And they went
c38468	to meet him
c38469	and bowed down to the ground before him.
c38470	they said to Elisha,
c38471	“Look now,” ... “we your servants have fifty valiant men.
c38472	Please let them go
c38473	and search for your master.
c38474	Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up
c38475	and put him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys.”
c38476	[Elisha] replied.
c38477	“Do not send them,”
c38478	But when they pressed him
c38479	to the point of embarrassment,
c38480	he said,
c38481	“Send [them].”
c38482	And they sent fifty men,
c38483	who searched for three days
c38484	but did not find [Elijah].
c38485	When they returned to [Elisha],
c38486	who was staying in Jericho,
c38487	he said to them,
c38488	“Didn't I tell you
c38489	not to go?”
c38490	Then the men of the city said to Elisha,
c38491	“Please note, ... that the city’s location is good,
c38492	our lord,
c38493	but the water [is] bad
c38494	and the land is unfruitful.”
c38495	he replied,
c38496	“Bring me a new bowl,”
c38497	“and put some salt in it.”
c38498	So they brought [it] to him,
c38499	and [Elisha] went out to the spring,
c38500	cast the salt into it,
c38501	and said,
c38502	“This is what the LORD says:
c38503	‘I have healed this water.
c38504	No longer will it cause death or unfruitfulness.’”
c38505	And the waters [there] have been healthy to this day, according to the word ... by Elisha.
c38506	spoken
c38507	From there, Elisha went up to Bethel,
c38508	and as he was walking up the road,
c38509	a group of young men came out of the city
c38510	and jeered at him,
c38511	chanting,
c38512	“Go up,
c38513	you baldhead!
c38514	Go up,
c38515	you baldhead!”
c38516	Then he turned around,
c38517	looked at them,
c38518	and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD.
c38519	Suddenly two female bears came out of the woods
c38520	and mauled forty-two of the young men.
c38521	And Elisha went on to Mount Carmel,
c38522	and from there he returned to Samaria.
c38523	In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat's reign over Judah, Jehoram son of Ahab became king of Israel, ... in Samaria
c38524	and he reigned ... twelve years.
c38525	And he did
c38526	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c38527	but not as his father and mother [had done].
c38528	For he removed the sacred pillar of Baal
c38529	that his father had made.
c38530	Nevertheless, ... to the sins ... Jeroboam son of Nebat
c38531	that ... had caused Israel to commit;
c38532	he clung
c38533	he did not turn away from them.
c38534	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder,
c38535	and he would render to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
c38536	But after the death of Ahab,
c38537	the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
c38538	So at that time King Jehoram set out from Samaria
c38539	and mobilized all Israel.
c38541	And he sent a message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah:
c38542	replied Jehoshaphat.
c38543	“The king of Moab has rebelled against me.
c38544	Will you go with me to fight against Moab?”
c38546	“I will go,”
c38547	“I [am] as you [are],
c38548	my people as your people,
c38549	my horses as your horses.”
c38550	Then he asked,
c38551	“Which way
c38552	shall we go up?”
c38553	replied Joram.
c38554	“By way of the Desert of Edom,”
c38555	So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out,
c38556	and after they had traveled a roundabout route for seven days,
c38557	they had no water for their army ... animals.
c38558	or for their
c38559	said the king of Israel,
c38560	“Alas,”
c38561	“for the LORD has summoned these three kings
c38562	to deliver them into the hand of Moab!”
c38563	But Jehoshaphat asked,
c38564	“Is there no prophet of the LORD here?
c38565	Let us inquire of the LORD through him.”
c38566	And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered,
c38568	“Elisha son of Shaphat is here.
c38569	[He] used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.”
c38570	Jehoshaphat affirmed,
c38571	“The word of the LORD is with him.”
c38572	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
c38573	Elisha, however, said to the king of Israel,
c38574	“What have we to do with [each other]?
c38575	Go to the prophets of your father and of your mother!”
c38576	replied the king of Israel,
c38577	“No,”
c38578	“for it is the LORD who has summoned these three kings
c38579	to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”
c38580	Then Elisha said,
c38581	“As surely as the LORD of Hosts lives,
c38582	before whom I stand,
c38583	were it not for my regard for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
c38584	I would not look at you
c38585	or acknowledge you.
c38586	But now,
c38587	bring me a harpist.”
c38588	came
c38589	And while the harpist played,
c38590	the hand of the LORD ... upon Elisha
c38591	and he said,
c38592	“This is what the LORD says:
c38593	‘Dig this valley full of ditches.’
c38594	For the LORD says,
c38595	‘You will not see wind
c38596	or rain,
c38597	but the valley will be filled with water,
c38598	and you will drink— you and your cattle and your animals.’
c38599	This is a simple matter in the sight of the LORD,
c38600	and He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
c38601	And you shall attack every fortified city and every city of importance.
c38602	You shall cut down every good tree,
c38603	stop up every spring,
c38604	and ruin every good field with stones.”
c38605	The next morning,
c38606	at the time of the morning sacrifice,
c38607	water suddenly flowed from the direction of Edom
c38608	and filled the land.
c38609	Now all the Moabites had heard
c38610	that the kings had come up
c38611	to fight against them.
c38612	So all who could bear arms, [young] and old, were summoned
c38613	and stationed at the border.
c38614	When they got up early in the morning,
c38615	the sun was shining on the water,
c38616	and [it] looked ... to the Moabites across the way.
c38617	[as] red as blood
c38618	they exclaimed.
c38619	“This is blood!”
c38620	“The kings have clashed swords
c38621	and slaughtered
c38622	each other.
c38623	Now to the plunder,
c38624	Moab!”
c38625	But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel,
c38626	the Israelites rose up
c38627	and attacked them,
c38628	and they fled before them.
c38629	So [the Israelites] invaded [their] land
c38630	and struck down the Moabites.
c38631	They destroyed the cities,
c38632	and each man threw stones on every good field
c38633	until it was covered.
c38634	They stopped up every spring
c38635	and cut down every good tree.
c38636	Only Kir-haraseth was left with stones in place,
c38637	but men with slings surrounded it
c38638	and attacked it [as well].
c38639	When the king of Moab saw
c38640	that the battle was too fierce for him,
c38641	he took with him seven hundred swordsmen
c38642	to break through to the king of Edom,
c38643	but they could not prevail.
c38644	So he took his firstborn son,
c38645	who was to succeed him,
c38646	and offered him as a burnt offering on the city wall.
c38647	And there was great fury against the Israelites,
c38648	so they withdrew
c38649	and returned to [their own] land.
c38650	Now the wife of one of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha,
c38652	“Your servant, my husband, is dead,
c38653	and you know
c38654	that your servant feared the LORD.
c38655	And now his creditor is coming
c38656	to take my two children as his slaves!”
c38657	asked Elisha.
c38658	“How can I help you?”
c38659	“Tell me,
c38660	what do you have in the house?”
c38661	She answered,
c38662	“Your servant has nothing in the house
c38663	but a jar of oil.”
c38664	said [Elisha],
c38665	“Go,”
c38666	“borrow empty jars from all your neighbors.
c38667	Do not gather just a few.
c38668	Then go inside,
c38669	shut the door behind you and your sons,
c38670	and pour oil into all these jars,
c38671	setting the full ones aside.”
c38672	So she left him,
c38673	and after she had shut the door behind her and her sons,
c38674	they kept bringing [jars] to her,
c38675	and she kept pouring.
c38676	When
c38677	all the jars were full,
c38678	she said to her son,
c38679	“Bring me another.”
c38680	But he replied,
c38681	“There are no more jars.”
c38682	Then the oil stopped flowing.
c38683	She went
c38684	and told the man of God,
c38685	and he said,
c38686	“Go,
c38687	sell the oil
c38688	and pay your debt,
c38689	and you and your sons can live on the remainder.”
c38690	One day
c38691	Elisha went to Shunem,
c38692	and a prominent woman who lived there
c38693	persuaded him
c38694	to have a meal.
c38695	So whenever
c38696	he would pass by,
c38697	he would stop there
c38698	to eat.
c38699	Then [the woman] said to her husband,
c38700	“Behold, now I know
c38701	that ... man of God.
c38702	the one ... is a holy
c38703	who often comes our way
c38704	Please let us make a small room upstairs
c38705	and put in it a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp for him.
c38707	Then when he comes to us,
c38708	he can stay there.”
c38709	One day
c38710	[Elisha] came to visit
c38711	and went to his upper room
c38712	to lie down.
c38713	And he said to Gehazi his servant,
c38714	“Call the Shunammite woman.”
c38715	And when he had called her,
c38716	she stood before him,
c38717	and [Elisha] said to Gehazi,
c38718	“Now tell her,
c38719	‘Look, you have gone to all this trouble for us.
c38720	What
c38721	can we do for you?
c38723	Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?’”
c38724	she replied.
c38725	“I have a home among my own people,”
c38726	So he asked,
c38727	“Then what
c38728	should be done for her?”
c38729	Gehazi replied,
c38730	“Well, she has no son,”
c38731	“and her husband is old.”
c38732	said Elisha.
c38733	“Call her,”
c38734	So Gehazi called her,
c38735	and she stood in the doorway.
c38736	And Elisha declared,
c38737	“At this time next year, you will hold a son {in your arms}.”
c38738	she said.
c38739	“No,
c38740	my lord,” ... O man of God.”
c38741	“Do not lie to your maidservant,
c38742	But the woman did conceive,
c38743	and at that time the next year she gave birth to a son,
c38744	just as Elisha had told her.
c38745	the child grew,
c38746	And ... and one day
c38747	he went out to his father, who was with the harvesters.
c38748	he complained to his father.
c38749	“My head!
c38750	My head!”
c38751	So his father told a servant, ... to
c38752	“Carry him ... his mother.”
c38753	After [the servant] had picked him up
c38754	and carried him to his mother,
c38755	[the boy] sat on her lap until noon,
c38756	and then he died.
c38757	And she went up
c38758	and laid him on the bed of the man of God.
c38759	Then she shut [the door]
c38760	and went out.
c38761	And the woman called her husband
c38762	and said,
c38763	“Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys,
c38764	that I may go quickly to the man of God
c38765	and return.”
c38766	he replied.
c38767	“Why would you go to him today?”
c38768	“It is not a New Moon
c38769	or a Sabbath.”
c38770	she said.
c38771	“Everything is all right,”
c38772	Then she saddled the donkey
c38773	and told her servant,
c38774	“Drive
c38775	onward;
c38776	do not slow
c38777	the pace for me
c38778	unless I tell you.”
c38779	So she set out
c38780	and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel.
c38782	When the man of God saw her at a distance,
c38783	he said to his servant Gehazi,
c38784	“Look, there is the Shunammite woman.
c38785	Please run out now
c38786	to meet her
c38787	and ask,
c38788	‘Are you all right?
c38789	Is your husband all right?
c38790	Is your child all right?’”
c38791	And she answered,
c38792	“Everything is all right.”
c38793	When she reached the man of God at the mountain,
c38794	she clung to his feet.
c38795	Gehazi came over
c38796	to push her away,
c38797	but the man of God said,
c38798	“Leave her alone,
c38799	for her soul [is] in deep distress,
c38800	and the LORD has hidden it from me
c38801	and has not told me.”
c38802	Then she said,
c38803	“Did I ask my lord for a son?
c38804	Didn’t I say,
c38805	‘Do not deceive me?’”
c38806	So Elisha said to Gehazi,
c38807	“Tie up your garment,
c38808	take my staff in your hand,
c38809	and go!
c38810	If you meet anyone,
c38811	do not greet him,
c38812	and if anyone greets you,
c38813	do not answer him.
c38814	Then lay my staff on the boy’s face.”
c38815	And the mother of the boy said,
c38816	“As surely as the LORD lives
c38817	and as you yourself live,
c38818	I will not leave you.”
c38819	So he got up
c38820	and followed her.
c38821	Gehazi went on ahead of them
c38822	and laid the staff on the boy’s face,
c38823	but there was no sound
c38824	[or] response.
c38825	So he went back
c38826	to meet [Elisha]
c38827	and told him,
c38829	“The boy has not awakened.”
c38830	When Elisha reached the house,
c38831	there was the boy ... dead
c38832	lying ... on his bed.
c38833	So he went in,
c38834	closed the door behind the two of them,
c38835	and prayed to the LORD.
c38836	Then [Elisha] got on the bed
c38837	and lay on the boy,
c38838	mouth ... mouth, ... to
c38839	eye ... eye, ... to
c38840	to ... and hands ... hands.
c38841	As he stretched himself out over him,
c38842	the boy’s body became warm.
c38843	Elisha turned away
c38844	and paced back and forth across the room.
c38845	Then he got on the bed
c38846	and stretched himself out over [the boy] again,
c38847	and the boy sneezed seven times
c38848	and opened his eyes.
c38849	Elisha summoned Gehazi
c38850	and said,
c38851	the Shunammite woman.” So he called
c38852	“Call
c38853	her and she came.
c38854	Then Elisha said,
c38855	“Pick up your son.”
c38856	She came in,
c38857	fell at his feet,
c38858	and bowed to the ground.
c38859	Then she picked up her son
c38860	and went out.
c38861	When Elisha returned to Gilgal,
c38862	there was a famine in the land.
c38863	As the sons of the prophets were sitting at his feet,
c38864	he said to his attendant,
c38865	“Put on the large pot
c38866	and boil some stew for the sons of the prophets.”
c38867	One [of them] went out to the field
c38868	to gather herbs,
c38869	and he found a wild vine
c38870	from which he gathered as many wild gourds as his garment [could hold.
c38871	Then he came back
c38872	and cut them up into the pot of stew,
c38873	though no one knew [what they were].
c38874	And they poured it out for the men
c38875	to eat,
c38877	but when they tasted the stew
c38878	they cried out,
c38880	“There is death in the pot,
c38881	O man of God!”
c38882	And they could not
c38883	eat [it].
c38884	Then Elisha said,
c38885	“Get some flour.”
c38886	He threw it into the pot
c38887	and said,
c38888	“Pour it out for the people
c38889	to eat.”
c38890	And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
c38891	Now a man from Baal-shalishah came
c38892	to the man of God with a sack of twenty loaves of barley bread from the first ripe grain.
c38893	said Elisha.
c38894	“Give it to the people
c38895	to eat,”
c38896	But his servant asked,
c38897	“How am I to set twenty loaves before a hundred men?”
c38898	said Elisha,
c38899	“Give it to the people
c38900	to eat,”
c38901	“for this is what the LORD says:
c38902	‘They will eat
c38903	and have [some] left over.’”
c38904	So he set [it] before them,
c38905	and they ate
c38906	and had [some] left over, according to the word of the LORD.
c38907	Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his master’s sight
c38908	and highly regarded;
c38909	for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram.
c38910	And he was a mighty warrior,
c38911	[but he was] a leper.
c38912	At this time the Arameans had gone out in bands
c38913	and had taken a young girl from the land of Israel,
c38914	and she was serving Naaman’s wife.
c38915	She said to her mistress,
c38916	“If only my master would go to the prophet
c38917	who is in Samaria,
c38918	he would cure him of his leprosy.”
c38919	And Naaman went
c38920	and told his master
c38922	what the girl ... had said.
c38923	from the land of Israel
c38924	said the king of Aram,
c38925	“Go now,”
c38927	“and I will send you with a letter to the king of Israel.”
c38928	So [Naaman] departed,
c38929	taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand [shekels] of gold, and ten sets of clothing.
c38930	And the letter that he took to the king of Israel
c38931	stated:
c38932	“With
c38933	this letter
c38934	I have sent my servant Naaman,
c38935	so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”
c38937	When the king of Israel read the letter,
c38938	he tore his clothes
c38939	and asked,
c38940	“Am I God,
c38941	killing
c38942	and giving life,
c38943	that this [man] expects me
c38944	to cure a leper?
c38945	Surely you can ... that
c38946	see
c38947	he is seeking a quarrel with me!”
c38948	Now
c38949	when Elisha the man of God heard
c38950	that the king of Israel had torn his clothes,
c38951	he sent a message to the king:
c38953	“Why have you torn your clothes?
c38954	Please let [the man] come to me,
c38955	and he will know
c38956	that there is a prophet in Israel.”
c38957	So Naaman came with his horses and chariots
c38958	and stood at the door of Elisha’s house.
c38959	Then Elisha sent him a messenger,
c38960	who said,
c38961	“Go
c38962	and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan,
c38963	and your flesh will be restored,
c38964	and you will be clean.”
c38965	But Naaman ... angry,
c38966	went away
c38967	saying,
c38968	“I thought that ... over
c38969	he would surely come out,
c38970	stand
c38971	and call on the name of the LORD his God,
c38972	and wave his hand ... the spot
c38973	to cure my leprosy.
c38974	[Are] not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?
c38975	Could I not have washed in them
c38976	and been cleansed?”
c38977	So he turned
c38978	and went away in a rage.
c38979	Naaman's servants, however, approached him
c38980	and said,
c38982	“My father,
c38983	if the prophet had told you to do some great thing,
c38984	would you not have done [it]?
c38985	How much more, then, when he tells you,
c38986	‘Wash
c38987	and be cleansed’?”
c38988	So Naaman went down
c38989	and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God,
c38990	and his flesh was restored and became like [that] of a little child,
c38991	and he was clean.
c38992	Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God,
c38994	stood before him,
c38995	and declared,
c38996	“Now I know for sure
c38997	that there is no God in all the earth except
c38998	in Israel.
c38999	So please accept a gift from your servant.”
c39000	But Elisha replied,
c39001	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c39002	before whom I stand,
c39003	I will not accept it.”
c39004	And although Naaman urged him
c39005	to accept it,
c39006	he refused.
c39007	said Naaman,
c39008	“If you will not,”
c39009	“please let me, your servant, be given as much soil as a pair of mules can carry.
c39010	your servant will never again make a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any other god but
c39011	For ... the LORD.
c39012	Yet may the LORD forgive your servant this one thing:
c39013	When my master goes into the temple of Rimmon
c39014	to worship there,
c39015	and he leans on my arm,
c39016	and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon,
c39018	may the LORD forgive your servant in this matter.”
c39019	said [Elisha],
c39020	“Go in peace,”
c39021	and [Naaman] departed. But after he had traveled a short distance,
c39022	Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,
c39023	“Look, my master has spared this Aramean, Naaman,
c39024	while not accepting
c39025	what he brought.
c39026	As surely as the LORD lives,
c39027	I will run after him
c39028	and get something from him.”
c39029	So Gehazi pursued Naaman.
c39030	And when Naaman saw [him]
c39031	running toward him,
c39032	he got down from the chariot
c39033	to meet him
c39034	and asked,
c39035	“Is everything all right?”
c39036	Gehazi replied.
c39037	“Everything [is] all right,”
c39038	“My master has sent
c39039	me to say,
c39040	‘I have just now discovered
c39041	that two young men from the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim.
c39042	Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.’”
c39043	But Naaman insisted,
c39044	“Please,
c39045	take two talents.”
c39046	And he urged Gehazi {to accept them}.
c39047	Then he tied up two talents of silver in two bags along with two sets of clothing
c39048	and gave them to two of his servants,
c39049	who carried them ahead of Gehazi.
c39050	When Gehazi came to the hill,
c39051	he took the gifts from [the servants]
c39052	and stored them in the house.
c39053	Then he dismissed the men,
c39054	and they departed.
c39055	When Gehazi went in
c39056	and stood before his master,
c39057	Elisha asked him,
c39058	where [have you been]?”
c39059	“Gehazi,
c39060	he replied.
c39061	“Your servant did not go anywhere,”
c39062	But Elisha questioned him,
c39063	“Did not my spirit go [with you]
c39064	when the man got down from his chariot
c39065	to meet you?
c39066	Is this the time
c39067	to accept money
c39068	and clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants?
c39069	Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and your descendants forever!”
c39070	And as Gehazi left his presence,
c39071	[he was] leprous— [as white] as snow.
c39072	Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha,
c39073	“Please take note that the place
c39074	where we meet with you
c39075	is too small for us.
c39076	Please let us go to the Jordan,
c39077	where ... can get
c39078	each of us ... a log
c39079	so we can build ourselves a place ... there.”
c39080	to live
c39081	said [Elisha].
c39082	“Go,”
c39083	Then one of them said,
c39084	“Please
c39085	come with your servants.”
c39086	he replied.
c39087	“I will come,”
c39088	So [Elisha] went with them,
c39089	and when they came to the Jordan,
c39090	they began to cut down some trees.
c39092	As one of them was cutting down a tree,
c39093	the iron [axhead] fell into the water.
c39094	he cried out,
c39096	“Oh, my master,”
c39097	“it was borrowed!”
c39098	asked the man of God.
c39099	“Where did it fall?”
c39100	And when he showed him the place,
c39101	the man of God cut a stick,
c39102	threw it there,
c39103	and made the iron float.
c39104	he said,
c39105	“Lift [it] out,”
c39106	and [the man] reached out his hand
c39107	and took it.
c39108	Now the king of Aram was
c39109	at war against Israel.
c39110	After consulting with his servants,
c39111	he said,
c39112	“My camp [will be] in such and such a place.”
c39113	Then the man of God sent word to the king of Israel:
c39115	“Be careful
c39116	passing by this place,
c39117	for the Arameans are going down there.”
c39118	So the king of Israel sent word to the place
c39119	the man of God had pointed out
c39120	[Elisha] warned the king,
c39121	so that he was on his guard in such places.
c39122	Time and again
c39124	For this reason, the king of Aram became enraged
c39125	and called his servants ... of them,
c39126	to demand
c39127	“Tell me,
c39128	which one
c39129	of us
c39130	[is] on the side of the king of Israel?”
c39131	But one of his servants replied,
c39132	“No one,
c39133	my lord the king.
c39134	For Elisha, the prophet
c39135	in Israel,
c39136	tells the king of Israel the very words
c39137	you speak in your bedroom.”
c39138	So the king said,
c39139	“Go
c39140	and see
c39141	where he [is],
c39142	that I may send
c39143	men to capture him.”
c39144	On receiving the report,
c39146	“Elisha is in Dothan,”
c39147	[the king of Aram] sent horses, chariots, and a great army.
c39148	They went there by night
c39149	and surrounded the city.
c39150	When the servant of the man of God ... early in the morning,
c39151	got up
c39152	and went out
c39153	an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city.
c39154	So he asked Elisha,
c39155	“Oh, my master,
c39156	what are we to do?”
c39157	Elisha answered,
c39158	“Do not be afraid,”
c39159	“for ... [are] more
c39160	those who [are] with us
c39161	than those who [are] with them.”
c39162	Then Elisha prayed,
c39164	“O LORD,
c39165	please open his eyes
c39166	that he may see.”
c39167	And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man,
c39168	and he saw that
c39169	the hills were full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
c39170	As the Arameans came down against him,
c39171	Elisha prayed to the LORD,
c39173	“Please strike these people with blindness.”
c39174	So He struck them with blindness, according to the word of Elisha.
c39175	And Elisha told them,
c39176	“This is not the way,
c39177	and this is not the city.
c39178	me, and I will take
c39179	Follow ... you to the man
c39180	you are seeking.”
c39181	And he led them to Samaria.
c39183	When they had entered Samaria,
c39184	Elisha said,
c39185	“O LORD,
c39186	open the eyes of these [men]
c39187	that they may see.”
c39188	Then the LORD opened their eyes,
c39189	and they looked around
c39190	and discovered they were in Samaria.
c39191	And when the king of Israel ... he asked Elisha,
c39192	saw them,
c39193	Shall I kill [them]?”
c39194	shall I kill [them]?
c39195	“My father,
c39196	he replied.
c39197	“Do not kill them,”
c39199	those you have captured with your own sword or bow?
c39200	“Would you kill
c39201	Set food and water before them,
c39202	that they may eat
c39203	and drink
c39204	and then return to their master.”
c39205	So [the king] prepared a great feast for them,
c39206	and after they had finished eating
c39207	and drinking,
c39208	he sent them away,
c39209	and they returned to their master.
c39210	And the Aramean raiders did not ... again.
c39211	come into the land of Israel
c39212	Some time later,
c39213	Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his entire army
c39214	and marched up
c39215	to besiege Samaria.
c39216	So there was a great famine in Samaria.
c39217	Indeed, they besieged [the city]
c39218	so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty [shekels] of silver,
c39219	and a quarter cab of dove’s dung sold for five [shekels] of silver.
c39221	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall,
c39222	a woman cried out to him,
c39224	“Help me,
c39225	my lord the king!”
c39226	He answered,
c39227	“If the LORD does not help you,
c39228	where can I find help for you?
c39229	From the threshing floor or the winepress?”
c39230	Then the king asked her,
c39231	“What is the matter?”
c39232	And she answered,
c39233	“This woman said to me,
c39234	‘Give up your son,
c39235	and we will eat him today,
c39236	and tomorrow we will eat my son.’
c39237	So we boiled my son
c39238	and ate him,
c39239	and the next day I said to her,
c39240	‘Give up your son,
c39241	and we will eat him.’
c39242	But she has hidden her son.”
c39244	When the king heard the words of the woman,
c39245	he tore his clothes.
c39246	And as he passed by on the wall,
c39247	the people saw
c39248	the sackcloth under his clothes next to his skin.
c39249	He announced,
c39250	“May God punish me,
c39251	and ever so severely,
c39252	if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders through this day!”
c39253	Now Elisha was sitting in his house,
c39254	and the elders were sitting with him.
c39255	The king sent a messenger ahead,
c39256	but before [he] arrived,
c39257	Elisha said to the elders,
c39258	“Do you see
c39259	how this murderer has sent
c39260	someone to cut off my head?
c39261	Look,
c39262	when the messenger comes,
c39263	shut the door
c39264	to keep him out.
c39265	Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?”
c39266	While Elisha was still speaking with them,
c39267	the messenger came down to him.
c39268	And [the king] said,
c39269	“This
c39270	calamity [is] from the LORD.
c39271	Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?”
c39272	Then Elisha said,
c39273	“Hear the word of the LORD!
c39274	This is what the LORD says:
c39275	‘About this time tomorrow ... a seah of fine flour [will sell] for a shekel,
c39276	at the gate of Samaria, ... and two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel.’”
c39277	But the officer ... answered
c39278	the king
c39279	on whose arm ... leaned
c39280	the man of God,
c39281	replied [Elisha],
c39282	“Look, even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven,
c39283	could this really happen?”
c39285	“You will see [it] with your own eyes,”
c39286	“vvv but you will not eat any of it.”
c39287	Now there were four men
c39288	with leprosy
c39289	at the entrance to the gate,
c39290	and they said
c39291	to one another,
c39292	“Why just sit here
c39293	until we die?
c39294	If we say,
c39295	‘Let us go into the city,’
c39296	from the famine in the city;
c39297	we will die there
c39298	but if we sit here,
c39299	we will also die.
c39300	So come now,
c39301	let us go over to the camp of the Arameans.
c39302	If ... we will live;
c39303	they let us live,
c39304	if they kill us,
c39305	we will die.”
c39306	So they arose at twilight
c39307	to the camp of the Arameans. But when they came
c39308	and went ... to the outskirts of the camp,
c39309	there was not a man to be found.
c39310	For the LORD {had caused} the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a great army,
c39311	so that they said
c39312	to each other,
c39313	“Look, the king of Israel must have hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians ... us.”
c39314	to attack
c39315	Thus [the Arameans] had arisen
c39316	and fled at twilight,
c39317	abandoning their tents and horses and donkeys. The camp was intact,
c39319	and they had run for their lives.
c39320	When the lepers reached the edge of the camp,
c39321	they went into a tent
c39322	to eat
c39323	and drink.
c39324	Then they carried off the silver, gold, and clothing,
c39325	and went
c39326	and hid [them].
c39327	On returning,
c39328	they entered another tent,
c39329	carried off [some items] from there,
c39331	and hid them.
c39332	Finally, they said
c39333	to one another,
c39334	“We are not doing what is right.
c39335	Today
c39336	is a day of good news.
c39337	If we are silent
c39338	and wait until morning light,
c39339	our sin will overtake us.
c39340	Now, therefore,
c39341	let us go
c39342	and tell the king’s household.”
c39343	So they went
c39344	and called out to the gatekeepers of the city,
c39345	saying,
c39347	“We went to the Aramean camp
c39348	and no one [was] there— not a trace—
c39349	only tethered horses and donkeys,
c39350	and the tents
c39351	were intact.”
c39352	The gatekeepers shouted the news,
c39353	and it was reported to the king’s household.
c39354	So the king got up in the night
c39355	and said to his servants,
c39356	“Let me tell you
c39357	what the Arameans have done to us.
c39358	They know
c39359	we are starving, ... ‘When
c39360	so they have left the camp
c39361	to hide in the field,
c39362	thinking,
c39363	they come out of the city,
c39364	we will take them alive
c39365	and enter the city.’”
c39366	But one of his servants replied,
c39368	“Please, have [scouts] take five of the horses ... remain
c39369	that ... in the city.
c39370	Their plight will be no worse than all the Israelites
c39371	who are left here.
c39372	You can see that all the Israelites
c39373	here are doomed.
c39374	So let us send them
c39375	and find out.”
c39376	Then [the scouts] took two chariots with horses,
c39377	and the king sent them after the Aramean army,
c39378	saying,
c39379	“Go
c39380	and see.”
c39381	And they tracked them as far as the Jordan,
c39382	and indeed, the whole way was littered with the clothing and equipment
c39383	the Arameans had thrown off
c39384	in haste.
c39385	So the scouts returned
c39386	and told the king.
c39387	Then the people went out
c39388	and plundered the camp of the Arameans.
c39389	It was then that a seah of fine flour [sold] for a shekel,
c39390	and two seahs of barley [sold] for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
c39391	Now the king had appointed the officer
c39392	on whose arm he leaned
c39393	to be in charge of the gate,
c39394	but the people trampled him in the gateway,
c39395	and he died,
c39396	just as the man of God had foretold
c39398	when the king had come to him.
c39399	It happened
c39400	just as the man of God had told the king:
c39402	two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel,
c39403	“About this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria, ... and a seah of fine flour will sell for a shekel.”
c39404	And the officer had answered the man of God,
c39405	So Elisha had replied,
c39406	“Look, even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven,
c39407	could this really happen?”
c39409	“You will see [it] with your own eyes,
c39410	but you will not eat any of it.”
c39411	And this is just what happened to him.
c39412	The people trampled him in the gateway,
c39413	and he died.
c39414	Now Elisha said to the woman
c39415	whose son he had restored to life, ... wherever
c39417	“Arise,
c39418	you and your household, and go
c39419	and live as a foreigner
c39420	you can.
c39421	For the LORD has decreed ... famine,
c39422	a seven-year ... and it has already come to the land.”
c39423	So the woman got ready
c39424	and did as the man of God had instructed.
c39425	She and her household
c39426	lived as foreigners for seven years in the land of the Philistines.
c39427	At the end of seven years,
c39428	when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines,
c39429	she went
c39430	to the king to appeal for her house and her land.
c39431	Now the king had been speaking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God,
c39432	saying,
c39433	“Please relate to me all the great things
c39434	Elisha has done.”
c39435	And as
c39436	Gehazi was telling the king
c39437	how Elisha had brought the dead back to life,
c39438	is the woman,
c39439	whose son he had revived
c39440	came to appeal to the king for her house and her land.
c39441	So Gehazi said,
c39442	“My lord the king,
c39443	the woman ... this
c39444	and this is the son
c39445	Elisha restored to life.”
c39446	When the king asked the woman,
c39447	she confirmed it.
c39448	So the king appointed for her an officer,
c39449	saying,
c39450	“Restore all
c39451	that was hers,
c39452	along with all the proceeds of the field from the day
c39453	that she left the country
c39454	until now.”
c39455	Then Elisha came to Damascus
c39456	while Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick,
c39457	and the king was told,
c39459	“The man of God has come here.”
c39460	So the king said to Hazael,
c39461	“Take a gift in your hand,
c39462	go
c39463	to meet the man of God,
c39464	and inquire of the LORD through him,
c39466	‘Will I recover from this illness?’”
c39467	So Hazael went
c39468	to meet Elisha,
c39469	taking with him a gift
c39470	of forty camel-loads of every good thing from Damascus.
c39471	And he went in
c39472	and stood before him
c39473	and said,
c39474	“Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent
c39475	me to ask,
c39476	‘Will I recover from this illness?’”
c39477	Elisha answered,
c39478	“Go
c39479	and say to him,
c39480	‘You will surely recover.’
c39481	But the LORD has shown me
c39482	that in fact he will die.”
c39483	[Elisha] fixed his gaze
c39484	steadily
c39485	[on him] until Hazael became uncomfortable.
c39486	Then the man of God began to weep.
c39487	asked Hazael.
c39488	“Why is my lord weeping?”
c39489	[Elisha] replied.
c39490	“Because I know
c39491	the evil you will do to the Israelites,”
c39492	“You will set fire to their fortresses,
c39493	kill their young men with the sword,
c39494	dash their little ones to pieces,
c39495	and rip open their pregnant women.”
c39496	said Hazael.
c39497	“But what [is] your servant, a mere dog,
c39498	that he should do this monstrous thing?”
c39499	And Elisha answered,
c39500	“The LORD has shown me that you [will become]
c39501	king over Aram.”
c39502	So Hazael left Elisha
c39503	and went to his master,
c39504	who asked him,
c39505	“What did Elisha say to you?”
c39506	And he replied,
c39507	“He told me
c39508	you would surely recover.”
c39509	But the next day
c39510	Hazael took a thick cloth,
c39511	dipped it in water,
c39512	and spread it over the king’s face.
c39513	So Ben-hadad died,
c39514	and Hazael reigned in his place.
c39515	In the fifth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab over Israel,
c39517	Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat succeeded his father as king of Judah.
c39518	Jehoram [was] thirty-two years old
c39519	when he became king,
c39520	and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
c39521	And [Jehoram] walked in the way of the kings of Israel,
c39522	just as the house of Ahab had done.
c39523	For he married a daughter of Ahab
c39524	and did evil in the sight of the LORD.
c39525	the LORD was unwilling
c39526	Yet for the sake of His servant David, ... to destroy Judah,
c39527	since He had promised
c39528	to maintain a lamp for David
c39529	[and] his descendants forever.
c39530	In the days of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against the hand of Judah
c39531	and appointed their own king.
c39532	So Joram crossed over to Zair
c39533	with all his chariots.
c39535	he rose up ... by night.
c39536	When the Edomites ... and attacked
c39537	surrounded him
c39538	and his chariot commanders,
c39539	His troops, however, fled to their homes.
c39540	So to this day Edom has been in rebellion against the hand of Judah.
c39541	Likewise, Libnah rebelled at the same time.
c39542	As for the rest of the acts of Joram, along with all
c39543	his accomplishments,
c39544	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c39545	And Joram rested with his fathers
c39546	and was buried with [them] in the City of David.
c39547	And his son Ahaziah became king in his place.
c39548	In the twelfth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab over Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah.
c39549	Ahaziah [was] twenty-two years old
c39550	when he became king,
c39551	and he reigned in Jerusalem one year.
c39552	His mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
c39553	And [Ahaziah] walked in the way of the house of Ahab
c39554	and did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab,
c39555	for he was a son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
c39556	Then Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to fight against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead,
c39557	and the Arameans wounded Joram.
c39558	So King Joram returned
c39559	to Jezreel to recover from the wounds
c39560	that the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah
c39561	in his battle against Hazael king of Aram.
c39562	And Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down
c39563	to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab,
c39564	since Joram had been wounded.
c39565	Now Elisha the prophet summoned one of the sons of the prophets
c39566	and said to him,
c39567	“Tuck your cloak under your belt,
c39568	take this flask of oil,
c39569	and go to Ramoth-gilead.
c39570	When you arrive,
c39571	look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi.
c39572	Go in,
c39573	get him away from his companions,
c39574	and take him to an inner room.
c39575	Then take the flask of oil,
c39576	pour it on his head,
c39577	and declare,
c39578	‘This is what the LORD says:
c39579	I anoint you king over Israel.’
c39580	Then open the door
c39581	and run.
c39582	Do not delay!”
c39583	So the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead,
c39584	and when he arrived,
c39585	there.
c39586	the army commanders were sitting
c39587	he said.
c39588	“I have a message for you,
c39589	commander,”
c39590	asked Jehu.
c39591	“For which of us?”
c39592	he replied.
c39593	“For you,
c39594	commander,”
c39595	So Jehu got up
c39596	and went into the house,
c39597	where the young prophet poured the oil on his head
c39598	and declared,
c39599	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c39600	‘I anoint you king over the LORD’s people Israel.
c39601	And you are to strike down the house of your master Ahab,
c39602	so that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets [and] all the servants of the LORD [shed] by the hand of Jezebel.
c39603	The whole house of Ahab will perish,
c39604	and I will cut off from Ahab
c39605	all the males
c39606	in Israel, both slave and free.
c39607	I will make the house of Ahab like the houses of Jeroboam son of Nebat [and] Baasha son of Ahijah.
c39608	And the dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot [of ground] at Jezreel,
c39609	and [there will be] no one to bury [her].’”
c39610	Then the young prophet opened the door
c39611	and ran away.
c39612	When Jehu went out to the servants of his master,
c39613	they asked,
c39614	“Is everything all right?
c39615	Why did this madman come to you?”
c39616	he replied.
c39617	“You know the sort and their babble,”
c39618	they said.
c39619	“That is a lie!”
c39620	“Tell us!”
c39621	So Jehu answered,
c39622	“He talked to me about this and that,
c39623	and he said,
c39624	‘This is what the LORD says:
c39625	I anoint you king over Israel.’”
c39626	Quickly,
c39627	each man took his garment
c39628	and put [it] under [Jehu] on the bare steps.
c39629	Then they blew the trumpet
c39630	and proclaimed,
c39631	“Jehu is king!”
c39632	Thus Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram.
c39633	(Now Joram ... had been defending Ramoth-gilead
c39634	and all Israel ... against Hazael king of Aram,
c39635	but King Joram had returned
c39636	to Jezreel to recover from the wounds
c39637	he had suffered [at the hands] of the Arameans
c39638	in the battle against Hazael their king.)
c39639	So Jehu said,
c39640	“If you commanders wish to make me king,
c39641	then do not let anyone escape from the city
c39642	to go
c39643	and tell [it] in Jezreel.”
c39644	Then Jehu got into his chariot
c39645	and went to Jezreel,
c39646	because Joram was laid up there
c39647	and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down
c39648	to see [him].
c39649	Now the watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel
c39650	saw Jehu’s troops
c39651	approaching,
c39652	and he called out,
c39653	“I see a company of [troops]!”
c39654	Joram commanded.
c39655	“Choose a rider,”
c39656	“Send him out
c39657	to meet them
c39658	and ask,
c39659	‘Have you come in peace?’”
c39660	So a horseman rode off
c39661	to meet Jehu
c39662	and said,
c39663	“This is what the king asks:
c39664	‘Have you come in peace?’”
c39665	Jehu replied.
c39666	“What do you know about peace?”
c39667	“Fall in behind me.”
c39668	And the watchman reported,
c39670	“The messenger reached them,
c39671	but he is not coming back.”
c39672	So [the king] sent out a second horseman,
c39673	who went to them
c39674	and said,
c39675	“This is what the king asks:
c39676	‘Have you come in peace?’”
c39677	Jehu replied.
c39678	“What do you know about peace?”
c39679	“Fall in behind me.”
c39680	Again the watchman reported,
c39682	“He reached them,
c39683	but he is not coming back.
c39684	And the charioteer is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi—
c39685	he drives like a madman.”
c39686	Joram shouted,
c39687	“Harness!”
c39688	and they harnessed his chariot.
c39689	Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out,
c39690	each in his own chariot,
c39691	and met
c39692	Jehu
c39693	on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
c39695	When Joram saw Jehu,
c39696	he asked,
c39697	“Have you come in peace,
c39698	Jehu?”
c39699	he replied,
c39700	“How can there be peace,” ... “as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?”
c39701	Joram turned around
c39702	and fled,
c39703	calling out to Ahaziah,
c39704	“Treachery,
c39705	Ahaziah!”
c39706	Then Jehu drew his bow
c39707	and shot Joram between the shoulders.
c39708	The arrow pierced his heart,
c39709	and he slumped down in his chariot.
c39710	And [Jehu] said to Bidkar his officer,
c39711	“Pick him up
c39712	[and] throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.
c39713	For remember that
c39714	when you and I were riding together behind his father Ahab,
c39715	the LORD lifted up this oracle against him:
c39716	‘As surely as I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday,
c39717	declares the LORD,
c39718	so will I repay you on this plot of land,
c39719	declares the LORD.’
c39720	Now then,
c39721	pick him up
c39722	according to the word of the LORD, ... [and] throw him on the plot [of land].”
c39723	When King Ahaziah of Judah saw [this],
c39724	he fled up the road toward Beth-haggan.
c39725	And Jehu pursued him,
c39726	shouting,
c39727	him too!”
c39728	“Shoot
c39729	[So they shot Ahaziah] in his chariot on the Ascent of Gur,
c39730	near Ibleam,
c39731	and he fled to Megiddo
c39732	and died there.
c39733	Then his servants carried him by chariot to Jerusalem
c39734	and buried him with his fathers in his tomb in the City of David.
c39735	(In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.)
c39736	Now when Jehu arrived in Jezreel,
c39737	Jezebel heard [of it].
c39738	So she painted her eyes,
c39739	adorned her head,
c39740	and looked down from a window.
c39741	And as Jehu entered the gate,
c39742	she asked,
c39743	“Have you come in peace,
c39744	O Zimri, murderer of your master?”
c39745	He looked up at the window
c39746	and called out,
c39747	“Who is on my side?
c39748	Who?”
c39749	And two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
c39750	yelled [Jehu].
c39751	“Throw her down!”
c39752	So they threw her down,
c39753	and her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses
c39754	as they trampled her underfoot.
c39755	Then [Jehu] went in
c39756	and ate
c39757	and drank.
c39758	he said,
c39759	“Take care of this cursed [woman],”
c39760	“and bury her,
c39761	for she [was] the daughter of a king.”
c39762	But when they went out
c39763	to bury her,
c39764	they found nothing but
c39765	her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.
c39766	So they went back
c39767	and told [Jehu],
c39768	who replied,
c39769	“This is the word of the LORD,
c39770	which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite:
c39772	‘On the plot [of land] at Jezreel the dogs will devour Jezebel’s flesh.
c39773	And Jezebel’s body will lie like dung in the field in the plot at Jezreel,
c39774	so that no one can say:
c39775	This is Jezebel.’”
c39776	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.
c39777	So Jehu wrote letters
c39778	and sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders,
c39779	and to the guardians [of the sons] of Ahab,
c39780	saying:
c39781	since
c39782	“When this letter arrives,
c39783	your master’s sons are with you
c39784	and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weaponry,
c39785	select the best and most worthy son of your master,
c39786	set him on his father’s throne,
c39787	and fight for your master’s house.”
c39788	But they were terrified
c39789	and reasoned,
c39790	“If two kings could not stand against him,
c39791	how can we?”
c39792	sent
c39793	So the palace administrator,
c39794	the overseer of the city,
c39795	the elders, and the guardians
c39796	a message to Jehu:
c39797	you say.
c39798	“We are your servants,
c39799	whatever
c39801	and we will do
c39802	We will not make anyone king.
c39803	Do [whatever is] good in your sight.”
c39804	Then Jehu wrote them a second letter
c39805	and said:
c39806	“If you are on my side,
c39807	and if you will obey me,
c39808	then bring the heads of your master’s sons to me
c39809	at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.”
c39810	Now the king’s sons, seventy in all, ... by the leading men of the city.
c39811	were being brought up
c39812	And
c39813	when the letter arrived,
c39814	they took the king’s sons
c39815	and slaughtered all seventy of them,
c39816	put their heads in baskets,
c39817	and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.
c39818	When the messenger arrived,
c39819	he told [Jehu],
c39820	And [Jehu] ordered,
c39821	“They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”
c39823	“Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”
c39824	The next morning,
c39825	[Jehu] went out
c39826	and stood
c39827	before all the people and said,
c39828	“You are innocent.
c39829	It was I who conspired against my master
c39830	and killed him.
c39831	But who killed all these?
c39832	Know, then,
c39833	that not a word the LORD ... will fail,
c39834	has spoken against the house of Ahab ... for the LORD ... what
c39835	has done
c39836	He promised through His servant Elijah.”
c39837	So Jehu killed everyone
c39838	in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab,
c39839	as well as all his great men and close friends and priests,
c39840	leaving him without [a single] survivor.
c39841	Then [Jehu] set out
c39843	toward Samaria.
c39844	At Beth-eked of the Shepherds,
c39845	Jehu met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah
c39846	and asked,
c39847	“Who are you?”
c39848	they answered,
c39849	“We are relatives of Ahaziah,”
c39850	“and we have come down to greet the sons of the king [and] of the queen mother.”
c39851	Then Jehu ordered,
c39852	“Take them alive.”
c39853	So [his men] took them alive,
c39854	then slaughtered them at the well of Beth-eked— forty-two men.
c39855	He spared none of them.
c39856	When he left there,
c39857	he found Jehonadab son of Rechab,
c39858	who was coming to meet him.
c39859	[Jehu] greeted him
c39860	and asked, ... into
c39861	“Is your heart as true to mine
c39862	as my heart is to yours?”
c39863	Jehonadab replied.
c39864	“It is!”
c39865	“If it is,” said Jehu,
c39866	“give me your hand.”
c39867	So he gave him his hand,
c39868	and Jehu helped him ... his chariot,
c39869	saying,
c39870	“Come with me
c39871	and see my zeal for the LORD!”
c39872	So he had him ride in his chariot.
c39873	When Jehu came to Samaria,
c39874	he struck down everyone
c39875	belonging to Ahab who remained [there],
c39876	until he had destroyed them,
c39877	according to the word ... the LORD
c39878	that ... had spoken to Elijah.
c39879	Then Jehu brought all the people together
c39880	and said,
c39881	“Ahab served Baal a little,
c39882	but Jehu will serve him a lot.
c39883	Now, therefore,
c39884	summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests.
c39885	See that no one is missing,
c39886	for I have a great sacrifice for Baal.
c39887	Whoever
c39888	is missing
c39889	will not live.”
c39890	But Jehu was acting deceptively
c39891	in order to destroy the servants of Baal.
c39892	And Jehu commanded,
c39893	“Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.”
c39894	So they called one.
c39895	Then Jehu sent word throughout Israel,
c39896	and all the servants of Baal came;
c39897	there was not a man
c39898	who failed to show up.
c39899	They entered the temple of Baal,
c39900	and it was filled from end to end.
c39901	And [Jehu] said
c39902	to the keeper of the wardrobe,
c39903	“Bring out garments for all the servants of Baal.”
c39904	So he brought out garments for them.
c39905	Next, Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab entered the temple of Baal,
c39906	and Jehu said to the servants of Baal,
c39907	“Look around
c39908	to see
c39909	that there are no servants of the LORD here among you—
c39910	only servants of Baal.”
c39911	And they went in
c39912	to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.
c39913	Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside
c39914	and warned them,
c39915	“If anyone
c39916	allows one of the men ... to escape,
c39917	I am delivering into your hands
c39918	he will forfeit his life for theirs.”
c39920	When he had finished
c39921	making the burnt offering,
c39922	Jehu said to the guards and officers,
c39923	“Go in
c39924	and kill them.
c39925	Do not let anyone out.”
c39926	struck them down with the sword,
c39927	So the guards and officers ... threw the bodies out,
c39928	and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal.
c39929	They brought out the [sacred] pillar of the temple of Baal
c39930	and burned it,
c39931	and they demolished the [sacred] pillar of Baal.
c39932	Then they tore down the temple of Baal
c39933	and made it into a latrine, which it is to this day.
c39934	Thus Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel,
c39935	but ... the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat
c39936	had caused Israel to commit—
c39937	he did not turn away from
c39938	the worship of the golden calves
c39939	at Bethel
c39940	and Dan.
c39941	Nevertheless, the LORD said to Jehu,
c39942	“Because you have done well
c39943	in carrying out what is right in My sight
c39944	all
c39945	that was in My heart,
c39946	and have done to the house of Ahab
c39947	four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.”
c39948	Yet Jehu was not careful
c39949	to follow the instruction of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart.
c39950	He did not turn away from the sins ... Jeroboam
c39951	that ... had caused Israel to commit.
c39952	In those days the LORD began
c39953	to reduce the size of Israel.
c39954	Hazael defeated the Israelites throughout their territory
c39955	from the Jordan eastward,
c39956	all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh),
c39957	and from Aroer
c39958	by the Arnon Valley
c39959	through Gilead to Bashan.
c39960	As for the rest of the acts of Jehu, along with all
c39961	his accomplishments
c39962	and all his might,
c39963	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c39964	And Jehu rested with his fathers
c39965	and was buried in Samaria,
c39966	and his son Jehoahaz became king in his place.
c39967	So the time
c39968	of Jehu’s reign over Israel
c39969	in Samaria [was] twenty-eight years.
c39970	When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw
c39971	that her son was dead,
c39972	she proceeded
c39973	to annihilate all the royal heirs.
c39974	But Jehosheba daughter of King Joram, the sister of Ahaziah, took Joash son of Ahaziah
c39975	and stole him away from among the sons of the king
c39976	[who were] being murdered.
c39977	[She put] him and his nurse in a bedroom
c39978	to hide him from Athaliah,
c39979	and he was not killed.
c39980	And [Joash] remained hidden with [his nurse] in the house of the LORD for six years
c39981	while Athaliah ruled the land.
c39982	Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for
c39983	the captains of hundreds, the Carites, and the guards,
c39984	and had them brought into the house of the LORD.
c39985	he made a covenant with them
c39986	[There] ... and put them under oath.
c39987	He showed them the king's son
c39988	and commanded them,
c39990	“This
c39991	is what you are to do:
c39992	A third of you
c39993	who come on duty on the Sabbath
c39994	shall guard the royal palace,
c39995	a third [shall be] at the gate of Sur,
c39996	and a third at the gate behind the guards.
c39997	You are to take turns guarding the temple—
c39998	the two divisions that would go off duty on the Sabbath
c39999	are to guard the house of the LORD for the king.
c40000	You must surround the king
c40001	and anyone
c40002	with weapons in hand,
c40004	who approaches the ranks
c40005	must be put to death.
c40006	You must stay close to the king
c40007	wherever he goes.”
c40009	So the commanders of hundreds did everything
c40010	that Jehoiada the priest had ordered.
c40011	took
c40012	Each of them ... his men—
c40013	those coming on duty on the Sabbath
c40014	and those going off duty—
c40015	and came to Jehoiada the priest.
c40016	Then the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and shields
c40017	of King David
c40018	from the house of the LORD.
c40019	And the guards stood
c40020	with weapons in hand
c40021	surrounding the king by the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
c40022	Then [Jehoiada] brought out the king’s son,
c40023	put the crown on him, presented him with the Testimony,
c40024	and proclaimed him king.
c40025	They anointed him,
c40026	and [the people] clapped their hands
c40027	and declared,
c40028	“Long live the king!”
c40029	When Athaliah heard the noise from the guards [and] the people,
c40030	she went out to the people in the house of the LORD.
c40031	And she looked out
c40032	and saw the king, standing by the pillar, according to the custom.
c40033	The officers and trumpeters were beside the king,
c40034	and all the people of the land were rejoicing
c40035	and blowing trumpets.
c40036	Then Athaliah tore her clothes
c40037	and screamed,
c40038	“Treason! Treason!”
c40039	And Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of hundreds
c40040	in charge of the army,
c40041	had said,
c40042	“Bring her out between the ranks,
c40044	anyone who follows her.”
c40045	and put to the sword
c40046	For the priest
c40047	“She must not be put to death in the house of the LORD.”
c40048	So they seized [Athaliah]
c40049	as she reached the horses' entrance to the palace grounds,
c40050	and there she was put to death.
c40051	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD, the king, and the people ... He also made a covenant between
c40052	that they would be the LORD’s people.
c40053	the king and the people.
c40054	So all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal
c40055	and tore it down.
c40056	They smashed the altars and idols into pieces,
c40057	and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
c40058	And Jehoiada the priest posted guards for the house of the LORD.
c40059	He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land,
c40060	and they brought the king {down} from the house of the LORD
c40061	and entered the royal palace by way of the gate of the guards.
c40062	Then [Joash] took his seat on the royal throne,
c40063	and all the people of the land rejoiced.
c40064	And the city was quiet,
c40065	because Athaliah had been put to the sword at the royal palace.
c40066	Joash [was] seven years old
c40067	when he became king.
c40068	In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash became king,
c40069	and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years.
c40070	His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.
c40071	And Joash did
c40072	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD
c40073	all the days
c40074	he was instructed by Jehoiada the priest.
c40075	Nevertheless, the high places were not removed;
c40076	the people continued sacrificing
c40077	and burning incense [there].
c40078	Then Joash said to the priests,
c40079	“[Collect] all the money ... as sacred gifts
c40080	brought ... into the house of the LORD— the census money,
c40081	the money from vows,
c40082	[and] the money
c40083	voluntarily
c40084	brought ... into the house of the LORD.
c40085	priest receive [it]
c40086	Let every ... from his constituency,
c40087	and let it be used to repair any damage ... in the temple.”
c40088	found
c40089	But by the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash,
c40090	the priests had not repaired the damage to the temple.
c40091	So King Joash called Jehoiada and the other priests
c40092	and said,
c40093	“Why have you not repaired the damage in the temple?
c40094	Now, therefore, take no more money from your constituency,
c40095	but hand it over for the repair of the temple.”
c40096	So the priests agreed
c40097	they would not receive money from the people
c40098	and that they would not repair the temple {themselves}.
c40099	Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest,
c40100	bored a hole in its lid,
c40101	and set it beside the altar on the right side
c40102	as one enters the house of the LORD.
c40103	There the priests who guarded the threshold put all the money
c40104	brought into the house of the LORD.
c40106	Whenever they saw
c40107	that [there was] a large amount of money in the chest,
c40108	the royal scribe and the high priest would go up,
c40109	and tie it up in bags.
c40110	count the money
c40111	brought into the house of the LORD,
c40112	Then they would put the counted money into the hands of those who ... the work
c40113	supervised ... on the house of the LORD,
c40114	who in turn would pay ... the carpenters, builders,
c40115	those doing the work—
c40116	masons, and stonecutters.
c40117	They also purchased timber and dressed stone
c40118	to repair the damage to the house of the LORD,
c40119	the other expenses
c40120	and they paid ... of the temple repairs.
c40121	However, the money ... was not [used for] making silver basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets, or any articles of gold or silver for the house of the LORD.
c40122	brought into the house of the LORD
c40123	Instead, it was paid to those doing the work,
c40124	and with it they repaired the house of the LORD.
c40125	No accounting was required from the men
c40126	who received the money to pay
c40127	the workmen,
c40128	because they acted with fidelity.
c40129	The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD;
c40130	it belonged to the priests.
c40131	At that time Hazael king of Aram marched up
c40132	and fought against Gath
c40133	and captured it.
c40134	Then he decided
c40135	to attack Jerusalem.
c40136	So King Joash of Judah took all the sacred objects
c40137	dedicated by his fathers— Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah—
c40138	along with his own consecrated items and all the gold
c40139	found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal palace,
c40140	and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram.
c40141	So [Hazael] withdrew from Jerusalem.
c40142	As for the rest of the acts of Joash, along with all
c40143	his accomplishments,
c40144	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c40145	And the servants [of Joash] rose up
c40146	and formed a conspiracy
c40147	and killed [him] at Beth-millo,
c40148	on the road down to Silla.
c40149	His servants Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer struck him down,
c40150	and he died.
c40151	And they buried him with his fathers in the City of David,
c40152	and his son Amaziah became king in his place.
c40153	In the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash son of Ahaziah over Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel, [and he reigned] in Samaria seventeen years.
c40154	And he did
c40155	evil in the sight of the LORD
c40156	and followed the sins ... Jeroboam son of Nebat
c40157	that ... had caused Israel to commit;
c40158	he did not turn away from them.
c40159	So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel,
c40160	and He delivered them continually into the hands of Hazael king of Aram and his son Ben-hadad.
c40161	Then Jehoahaz sought the favor of the LORD,
c40162	and the LORD listened to him
c40163	because He saw the oppression ... on Israel.
c40164	that the king of Aram had inflicted
c40165	So the LORD gave Israel a deliverer,
c40166	and they escaped the power of the Arameans.
c40167	Then the people of Israel lived in their own homes as they had before.
c40168	Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins ... the house of Jeroboam
c40169	that ... had caused Israel to commit,
c40170	[but] they continued to walk in them.
c40171	The Asherah even remained standing in Samaria.
c40172	Jehoahaz had no army left, except
c40173	fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers, because
c40174	the king of Aram had destroyed them
c40175	and made them like the dust
c40176	at threshing.
c40177	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, along with all
c40178	his accomplishments
c40179	and his might,
c40180	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c40181	And Jehoahaz rested with his fathers
c40182	and was buried in Samaria.
c40183	And his son Jehoash became king in his place.
c40184	In the thirty-seventh year of the reign of Joash over Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria, [and he reigned] sixteen years.
c40185	And he did
c40186	evil in the sight of the LORD
c40187	and did not turn away from all the sins ... Jeroboam son of Nebat
c40188	that ... had caused Israel to commit,
c40189	but he walked in them.
c40190	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoash, along with all
c40191	his accomplishments
c40192	and his might,
c40193	including his war against Amaziah king of Judah,
c40194	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c40195	And Jehoash rested with his fathers,
c40196	and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne.
c40197	Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
c40198	When Elisha had fallen sick with the illness
c40199	from which he would die,
c40200	Jehoash king of Israel came down to him
c40201	and wept over him,
c40202	saying,
c40203	“My father, my father,
c40204	the chariots and horsemen of Israel!”
c40205	Elisha told him,
c40206	“Take a bow and some arrows.”
c40207	So he himself took a bow and some arrows.
c40208	Then Elisha said to the king of Israel,
c40209	“Put your hand on the bow.”
c40210	So the king put his hand on [the bow],
c40211	and Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands.
c40212	said Elisha.
c40213	“Open the east window,”
c40214	So he opened [it]
c40215	and Elisha said,
c40216	“Shoot!”
c40217	So he shot.
c40218	Then Elisha declared,
c40219	“This is the LORD’s arrow of victory,
c40220	the arrow of victory over Aram,
c40221	for you shall strike the Arameans in Aphek
c40222	until you have put an end to them.”
c40223	Then Elisha said,
c40224	“Take the arrows!”
c40225	So he took [them],
c40226	and Elisha said to the king of Israel,
c40227	“Strike the ground!”
c40228	So he struck the ground three times
c40229	and stopped.
c40230	But the man of God was angry with
c40231	him and said,
c40232	“You should have struck the ground five or six times.
c40233	Then you would have struck down Aram
c40234	until you had put an end to it.
c40235	But now you will strike down Aram [only] three times.”
c40236	And Elisha died
c40237	and was buried.
c40238	Now the Moabite raiders used to come into the land
c40239	every spring.
c40240	Once,
c40241	as the Israelites were burying a man,
c40242	suddenly they saw a band [of raiders],
c40243	so they threw the man's body into Elisha’s tomb.
c40245	And when he touched the bones of Elisha, the man
c40246	was revived
c40247	and stood up on his feet.
c40248	And Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz.
c40249	But the LORD was gracious to them ... with
c40250	and had compassion on them,
c40251	and He turned toward them because of His covenant ... Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
c40252	He has been unwilling
c40253	to destroy them
c40254	And to this day, ... or cast them from His presence.
c40255	When Hazael king of Aram died,
c40256	his son Ben-hadad became king in his place.
c40257	Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz ... back
c40258	took ... from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the cities
c40259	that Hazael had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz.
c40260	Jehoash defeated Ben-hadad three times,
c40261	and so recovered the cities of Israel.
c40262	In the second year of the reign of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz over Israel, Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah.
c40263	He was twenty-five years old
c40264	when he became king,
c40265	and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years.
c40266	His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.
c40267	And he did
c40268	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD,
c40269	but not as his father David {had done}.
c40270	everything
c40271	He did ... as his father Joash
c40272	had done.
c40273	Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away,
c40274	and the people continued sacrificing
c40275	and burning incense on the high places.
c40277	As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp,
c40278	Amaziah executed the servants
c40279	who had murdered his father the king.
c40280	Yet he did not put the sons of the murderers to death,
c40281	according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses,
c40282	where the LORD commanded:
c40284	“Fathers must not be put to death for their children,
c40285	and children must not be put to death for their fathers;
c40286	each is to die for his own sin.”
c40287	Amaziah struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
c40288	He took Sela in battle
c40289	and called it Joktheel, its name to this very day.
c40290	Then Amaziah sent messengers to the king of Israel, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu.
c40291	he said.
c40292	“Come,
c40293	let us meet face to face,”
c40294	But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah:
c40296	“A thistle
c40297	in Lebanon
c40298	sent a message to a cedar
c40299	in Lebanon,
c40300	saying,
c40301	‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’
c40302	Then a wild beast ... came along
c40303	in Lebanon
c40304	and trampled the thistle.
c40305	You have indeed defeated Edom,
c40306	and your heart has become proud.
c40307	Glory [in that]
c40308	and stay at home.
c40309	Why should you stir up trouble
c40310	so that you fall— you and Judah with you?”
c40311	But Amaziah would not listen,
c40312	and Jehoash king of Israel advanced.
c40313	He and King Amaziah of Judah faced off at Beth-shemesh
c40314	in Judah.
c40315	And Judah was routed before Israel,
c40316	fled
c40317	and every man ... to his home.
c40318	There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah.
c40319	Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem
c40320	and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate— [a section of] four hundred cubits.
c40321	He took all the gold and silver and all the articles
c40322	found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace,
c40323	as well as some hostages.
c40324	Then he returned to Samaria.
c40325	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoash,
c40326	along with his accomplishments,
c40327	his might,
c40328	and how he waged war against Amaziah king of Judah,
c40329	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c40330	And Jehoash rested with his fathers,
c40331	and he was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
c40332	And his son Jeroboam became king in his place.
c40333	Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
c40334	As for the rest of the acts of Amaziah,
c40335	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c40336	And conspirators plotted against {Amaziah] in Jerusalem,
c40337	and he fled to Lachish.
c40338	But men were sent after him to Lachish,
c40339	and they killed him there.
c40340	They carried him back on horses
c40341	and buried him in Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David.
c40342	Then all the people of Judah took Azariah,
c40343	who [was] sixteen years old,
c40344	and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
c40345	[Azariah was the one] who rebuilt Elath
c40346	and restored it to Judah
c40347	after King [Amaziah] rested with his fathers.
c40348	In the fifteenth year of the reign of Amaziah son of Joash over Judah, Jeroboam son of Jehoash became king of Israel, [and he reigned] in Samaria forty-one years.
c40349	And he did
c40350	evil in the sight of the LORD
c40351	and did not turn away from all the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat
c40352	had caused Israel to commit.
c40353	[This Jeroboam] restored the boundary of Israel
c40354	from Lebo-hamath
c40355	to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word the LORD, the God of Israel,
c40356	had spoken through His servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet
c40357	from Gath-hepher.
c40358	For the LORD saw that the affliction of the Israelites,
c40359	was very bitter.
c40360	both slave
c40361	[and] free,
c40362	There was no one to help Israel,
c40363	and since the LORD had said
c40364	that He would not blot out the name of Israel from under heaven,
c40365	He delivered them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash.
c40366	As for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, along with all
c40367	his accomplishments
c40368	and might,
c40369	and how he waged war
c40370	and recovered both Damascus and Hamath for Israel from Judah,
c40371	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c40372	And Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the kings of Israel.
c40373	And his son Zechariah became king in his place.
c40374	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam's reign over Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah became king of Judah.
c40375	He was sixteen years old
c40376	when he became king,
c40377	and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years.
c40378	His mother’s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem.
c40379	And he did
c40380	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD,
c40381	just as
c40382	his father Amaziah had done.
c40383	Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away;
c40384	the people continued sacrificing
c40385	and burning incense [there].
c40386	And the LORD afflicted the king
c40387	with leprosy until the day he died,
c40388	so that he lived in a separate house
c40389	while [his] son Jotham had charge of the palace
c40390	and governed the people of the land.
c40391	As for the rest of the acts of Azariah, along with all
c40392	his accomplishments,
c40393	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c40394	And Azariah rested with his fathers
c40395	and was buried with his fathers in the City of David.
c40396	And his son Jotham became king in his place.
c40397	In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel, [and he reigned] in Samaria six months.
c40398	And he did
c40399	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c40400	as his fathers had done.
c40401	He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat
c40402	had caused Israel to commit.
c40403	Then Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah
c40404	and struck him down ... in front of the people
c40405	and killed him
c40406	and became king in his place.
c40407	As for the rest of the acts of Zechariah,
c40408	they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
c40409	So the word of the LORD
c40410	spoken to Jehu
c40412	“Four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.”
c40413	was fulfilled:
c40414	In the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah's reign over Judah, Shallum son of Jabesh became king,
c40415	and he reigned in Samaria one full month.
c40416	Then Menahem son of Gadi went up from Tirzah
c40417	to Samaria,
c40418	struck down ... Shallum son of Jabesh,
c40419	and killed
c40420	and became king in his place.
c40421	As for the rest of the acts of Shallum, along with the conspiracy
c40422	he led,
c40423	they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
c40424	At that time Menahem, ... attacked Tiphsah and everyone
c40425	in its
c40426	starting from Tirzah, ... vicinity,
c40427	because they would not open [their gates].
c40428	So he attacked [Tiphsah]
c40429	and ripped open all the pregnant women.
c40430	In the thirty-ninth year of the reign of Azariah over Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king of Israel, [and he reigned] in Samaria ten years.
c40431	And he did
c40432	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c40433	he did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat
c40434	had caused Israel to commit.
c40435	and throughout his reign
c40436	Then Pul king of Assyria invaded the land,
c40437	and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver
c40438	in order to gain his support
c40439	and strengthen his own grip on the kingdom.
c40440	Menahem exacted this money from each of the wealthy men of Israel—
c40441	to give to the king of Assyria.
c40442	fifty shekels of silver from each man—
c40443	So the king of Assyria withdrew
c40444	and did not remain in the land.
c40445	As for the rest of the acts of Menahem, along with all
c40446	his accomplishments,
c40447	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
c40448	And Menahem rested with his fathers,
c40449	and his son Pekahiah became king in his place.
c40450	In the fiftieth year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king of Israel and reigned in Samaria two years.
c40451	And he did
c40452	evil in the sight of the LORD
c40453	and did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat
c40454	had caused Israel to commit.
c40455	Then his officer, Pekah son of Remaliah, conspired against him
c40456	along with Argob, Arieh, ... And at the citadel of the king’s palace in Samaria, [Pekah] struck down
c40457	and fifty men of Gilead.
c40458	and killed [Pekahiah]
c40459	and became king in his place.
c40460	As for the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, along with all
c40461	his accomplishments,
c40462	they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
c40463	In the fifty-second year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel [and reigned] in Samaria twenty years.
c40464	And he did
c40465	evil in the sight of the LORD
c40466	and did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat
c40467	had caused Israel to commit.
c40468	In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came
c40469	and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, including all the land of Naphtali,
c40470	and he took the people to Assyria {as captives}.
c40471	Then Hoshea son of Elah led a conspiracy against Pekah son of Remaliah.
c40472	[Hoshea] attacked [Pekah],
c40473	killed him,
c40474	In the twentieth year [of the reign] of Jotham son of Uzziah, ... and became king in his place.
c40475	As for the rest of the acts of Pekah, along with all
c40476	his accomplishments,
c40477	they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
c40478	In the second year of the reign of Pekah son of Remaliah over Israel, Jotham son of Uzziah became king of Judah.
c40479	He was twenty-five years old
c40480	when he became king,
c40481	and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
c40482	His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
c40483	And he did
c40484	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD,
c40485	just as
c40486	his father Uzziah had done.
c40488	Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away;
c40489	the people continued sacrificing
c40490	and burning incense [there].
c40491	Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD.
c40492	As for the rest of the acts of Jotham,
c40493	along with his accomplishments,
c40494	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c40495	(In those days the LORD began
c40496	to send Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.)
c40497	And Jotham rested with his fathers
c40498	and was buried with [them] in the City of David, his forefather.
c40499	And his son Ahaz became king in his place.
c40500	In the seventeenth year [of the reign] of Pekah son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah.
c40501	Ahaz was twenty years old
c40502	when he became king,
c40503	and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
c40504	he did not do
c40505	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
c40506	And unlike David his forefather,
c40507	Instead, he walked in the way of the kings of Israel
c40508	and even sacrificed his son in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations
c40509	whom the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
c40510	And he sacrificed
c40511	and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
c40512	Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to wage war against Jerusalem.
c40513	They besieged Ahaz
c40514	but could not
c40515	overcome [him].
c40516	At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram,
c40517	drove out the men of Judah,
c40518	and sent the Edomites into Elath,
c40519	where they live to this day.
c40520	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria,
c40521	saying,
c40522	“I am your servant and your son.
c40523	Come up
c40524	and save me from the hands of the kings of Aram [and] Israel,
c40525	who are rising up against me.”
c40526	Ahaz also took the silver and gold
c40527	found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s palace,
c40528	and he sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
c40529	So the king of Assyria listened to him,
c40530	marched up to Damascus,
c40531	and captured it.
c40532	He took its people to Kir as captives
c40533	and put Rezin to death.
c40534	Then King Ahaz went
c40535	to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria.
c40536	to Damascus
c40537	On seeing the altar
c40538	in Damascus,
c40539	King Ahaz sent Uriah the priest a model of the altar and complete plans for its construction.
c40540	And Uriah built the altar
c40541	according to all
c40542	the instructions King Ahaz had sent from Damascus,
c40543	[and] he completed it
c40544	by the time King Ahaz had returned.
c40545	When the king came back from Damascus
c40546	and saw the altar,
c40547	he approached [it]
c40548	and presented offerings on it.
c40549	He offered his burnt offering and his grain offering,
c40550	poured out his drink offering,
c40551	and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings
c40553	on the altar.
c40554	the bronze altar
c40555	that stood before the LORD
c40556	He also took ... from the front of the temple (between the [new] altar and the house of the LORD)
c40557	and he put it on the north side of the [new] altar.
c40558	Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest,
c40560	“Offer on the great altar the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, and the king’s burnt offering and grain offering, as well as the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings of all the people of the land.
c40561	Sprinkle on the altar all the blood of the burnt offerings [and] sacrifices.
c40562	But I will use the bronze altar
c40563	to seek guidance.”
c40564	So Uriah the priest did just as
c40565	King Ahaz had commanded.
c40566	King Ahaz also cut off the frames of the movable stands
c40567	and removed the bronze basin from each of them.
c40568	He took down the Sea from the bronze bulls
c40569	that were under it
c40570	and put it on a stone base.
c40571	And ... the Sabbath canopy
c40572	they had built in the temple
c40573	on account of the king of Assyria, he removed ... and closed the royal entryway outside the house of the LORD.
c40574	As for the rest of the acts of Ahaz,
c40575	along with his accomplishments,
c40576	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c40577	And Ahaz rested with his fathers
c40578	and was buried with [them] in the City of David,
c40579	and his son Hezekiah became king in his place.
c40580	In the twelfth year of the reign of Ahaz over Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel, [and he reigned] in Samaria nine years.
c40581	And he did
c40582	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c40583	but not like the kings of Israel
c40584	who preceded him.
c40585	Shalmaneser king of Assyria attacked him,
c40586	and Hoshea became his vassal
c40587	and paid him tribute.
c40588	But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea had conspired
c40589	to send envoys to King So of Egypt,
c40590	and that he had not paid tribute to the king of Assyria as in previous years.
c40591	Therefore the king of Assyria arrested [Hoshea]
c40592	and put him in prison.
c40593	Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land,
c40594	marched up to Samaria,
c40595	and besieged it for three years.
c40596	In the ninth year [of the reign] of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria
c40597	and carried away the Israelites to Assyria,
c40598	where he settled them in Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes.
c40599	All this happened
c40600	because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God,
c40601	who had brought them out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
c40602	They had worshiped other gods,
c40603	and they had walked in the customs of the nations
c40604	whom the LORD had driven out before the Israelites,
c40605	by the kings of Israel.
c40606	as well as in the practices introduced
c40607	The Israelites secretly did
c40608	that [were] not right.
c40609	things against the LORD their God
c40610	From watchtower to fortified city, they built high places in all their cities.
c40611	They set up for themselves [sacred] pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
c40612	They burned incense on all the high places like the nations
c40613	whom the LORD had driven out before them.
c40614	They did wicked things,
c40615	provoking the LORD {to anger}.
c40616	They served idols,
c40617	although the LORD had told them,
c40618	“You shall not do this.”
c40619	Yet through all His prophets [and] seers, the LORD warned Israel and Judah,
c40620	saying,
c40621	“Turn from your wicked ways
c40622	and keep My commandments and statutes, according to the entire Law
c40623	that I commanded your forefathers
c40624	and delivered to you through My servants the prophets.”
c40625	But they would not listen,
c40626	and they stiffened their necks like their fathers,
c40627	who did not believe the LORD their God.
c40628	They rejected His statutes and the covenant
c40629	He had made with their fathers,
c40630	as well as the decrees
c40631	He had given them.
c40632	They pursued worthless idols
c40633	and themselves became worthless,
c40634	going after ... nations
c40635	the surrounding
c40636	the LORD had commanded
c40637	them not to imitate.
c40638	They abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God
c40639	and made for themselves two cast idols of calves
c40640	and an Asherah pole.
c40641	They bowed down to all the host of heaven
c40642	and served Baal.
c40643	They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire
c40644	and practiced divination
c40645	and soothsaying.
c40646	They devoted themselves
c40647	to doing
c40648	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c40649	provoking Him to anger.
c40650	So the LORD was very angry with Israel,
c40651	and He removed them from His presence.
c40652	Only the tribe of Judah remained,
c40653	and even Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God,
c40654	but lived according to the customs Israel
c40655	had introduced.
c40656	So the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel.
c40657	He afflicted them
c40658	and delivered them into the hands of plunderers,
c40659	until He had banished them from His presence.
c40660	When [the LORD] had torn Israel away from the house of David,
c40661	they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king,
c40662	and Jeroboam led Israel away from following the LORD
c40663	and caused them to commit a great sin.
c40664	The Israelites persisted in all the sins ... Jeroboam
c40665	that ... committed
c40666	and did not turn away from them.
c40667	Finally, the LORD removed Israel from His presence,
c40668	as He had declared through all His servants the prophets.
c40669	So Israel was exiled from their homeland into Assyria, [where they are] to this day.
c40670	Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim
c40671	and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites.
c40672	They took possession of Samaria
c40673	and lived in its towns.
c40674	Now
c40675	when [the settlers] first lived there,
c40676	they did not worship the LORD,
c40677	so He sent lions among them,
c40678	which killed [some] of them.
c40679	So they spoke to the king of Assyria,
c40680	saying,
c40681	“The peoples
c40682	that you have removed
c40683	and placed in the cities of Samaria
c40684	do not know the requirements of the God of the land.
c40685	He has sent lions among them,
c40686	which are indeed killing them off.”
c40687	Because of this,
c40688	Then the king of Assyria commanded:
c40690	“Send back one of the priests ... there
c40691	you carried off from [Samaria],
c40692	and have him go back
c40693	to live
c40694	and teach the requirements of the God of the land.”
c40695	Thus one of the priests ... came
c40696	they had carried away
c40697	and lived in Bethel,
c40698	and he began to teach
c40699	them how they should worship the LORD.
c40700	Nevertheless, the people of each nation continued to make their own gods
c40701	and they set them up in the shrines ... on the high places.
c40702	that ... of Samaria had made
c40703	in the cities ... the people
c40704	where they had settled,
c40705	The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth,
c40706	the men of Cuth made Nergal,
c40707	the men of Hamath made Ashima,
c40708	the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak,
c40709	and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of the Sepharvaim.
c40710	So [the new residents] worshiped the LORD,
c40711	but they also appointed for themselves priests of all sorts ... of the high places.
c40712	to serve in the shrines
c40713	They worshiped the LORD,
c40714	but they also served their own gods according to the customs of the nations
c40715	from which they had been carried away.
c40716	To this day they are still practicing their former customs.
c40717	None of them worship the LORD
c40718	or observe the statutes, ordinances, laws, and commandments
c40719	that the LORD gave the descendants of Jacob,
c40720	whom He named Israel.
c40721	For the LORD had made a covenant with [the Israelites]
c40722	and commanded them,
c40724	“Do not worship other gods
c40725	[or] bow down to them;
c40726	do not serve them
c40727	[or] sacrifice to them.
c40728	Instead, ... the LORD,
c40729	who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm.
c40730	worship
c40731	You are to bow down to Him
c40732	and offer sacrifices to Him.
c40733	And ... the statutes, ordinances, laws, and commandments
c40734	He wrote for you.
c40735	be careful
c40736	you must always ... to observe
c40737	Do not worship other gods.
c40738	the covenant
c40739	I have made with you.
c40740	Do not forget
c40741	Do not worship other gods,
c40742	but worship the LORD your God,
c40743	and He will deliver you from the hands of all your enemies.”
c40744	But they would not listen,
c40745	and they persisted in their former customs.
c40746	So these nations worshiped the LORD
c40747	but also served their idols, and
c40748	their children and grandchildren
c40749	continue to do as their fathers
c40750	to this day ... did.
c40751	In the third year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah over Israel,
c40752	Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah.
c40753	He was twenty-five years old
c40754	when he became king,
c40755	and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years.
c40756	His mother’s name was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah.
c40757	And he did
c40758	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD,
c40759	just as
c40760	his father David had done.
c40761	He removed the high places,
c40762	shattered the sacred pillars,
c40763	and cut down the Asherah poles.
c40764	He also demolished the bronze serpent
c40765	that Moses had made,
c40766	for up to that time the Israelites
c40767	had burned incense to it.
c40768	called Nehushtan
c40769	Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel.
c40770	No king of Judah was like him, ... or after him.
c40771	either before him
c40772	He remained faithful to the LORD
c40773	and did not turn from following Him;
c40774	he kept the commandments
c40775	that the LORD had given Moses.
c40776	And the LORD was with [Hezekiah],
c40777	wherever
c40778	he went.
c40779	and he prospered
c40780	He rebelled against the king of Assyria
c40781	and refused to serve him.
c40782	He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza
c40783	and its borders, from watchtower to fortified city.
c40784	In the fourth year of Hezekiah's reign,
c40785	which was the seventh year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah over Israel,
c40786	Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria
c40787	and besieged it.
c40788	And at the end of three years, the Assyrians captured it.
c40789	in the sixth year of Hezekiah,
c40790	which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.
c40791	So Samaria was captured
c40792	The king of Assyria exiled the Israelites to Assyria
c40793	and settled them in Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes.
c40794	[This happened] because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD their God,
c40795	but violated His covenant— all
c40796	that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded—
c40797	and would neither listen
c40798	nor obey.
c40799	In the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked ... all the fortified cities of Judah.
c40800	and captured
c40801	So Hezekiah king of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish,
c40802	saying,
c40803	“I have done wrong;
c40804	withdraw from me,
c40805	whatever you demand from me.”
c40806	and I will pay
c40807	And the king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
c40808	Hezekiah gave him all the silver
c40809	that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace.
c40810	At that time Hezekiah stripped [the gold] ... the doors and doorposts of the temple of the LORD,
c40811	with which he had plated ... it to the king
c40812	and he gave ... of Assyria.
c40813	Nevertheless, the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rab-saris, and the Rab-shakeh, along with a great army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem.
c40814	They advanced up
c40815	to Jerusalem
c40818	and stationed themselves by the aqueduct of the upper pool,
c40819	on the road to the Launderer’s Field.
c40820	Then they called for the king;
c40821	and Eliakim son of Hilkiah ... went out to them.
c40822	the palace administrator,
c40823	Shebnah the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder,
c40824	The Rab-shakeh said to them,
c40825	“Tell Hezekiah
c40826	that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says:
c40827	What ... [of] this confidence
c40828	is the basis ... of yours?
c40829	You claim
c40830	[to have] a strategy and strength for war, but [these are] empty words.
c40831	are you now
c40832	On whom ... relying,
c40833	that you have rebelled against me?
c40834	now,
c40835	Look ... you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff ... on it.
c40836	of anyone who leans ... in him.
c40837	the hand
c40838	that will pierce
c40839	Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all
c40840	who trust
c40841	But if you say to me:
c40842	‘We trust in the LORD our God,’
c40843	is He not
c40844	the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed,
c40845	saying to Judah and Jerusalem:
c40846	‘You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem’?
c40847	Now, therefore,
c40848	make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria.
c40849	I will give you two thousand horses—
c40850	if you can
c40851	put riders on them!
c40852	For how can you repel a single officer among the least of my master’s servants
c40853	when you depend on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
c40854	So now,
c40855	was it apart from the LORD that I have come up against this place
c40856	to destroy it?
c40857	The LORD Himself said to me,
c40858	‘Go up against this land
c40859	and destroy it!’”
c40860	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, along with Shebnah and Joah, said to the Rab-shakeh,
c40861	“Please speak to your servants in Aramaic,
c40862	since we understand it.
c40863	Do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people
c40864	on the wall.”
c40865	But the Rab-shakeh replied,
c40866	“Has my master sent me ... only to you and your master,
c40867	to speak these words
c40868	and not to the men
c40869	sitting on the wall,
c40870	to eat their own dung
c40871	who are destined with you ... and drink their own urine?”
c40872	Then the Rab-shakeh stood
c40873	and called out loudly in Hebrew:
c40876	“Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!
c40877	This is what the king says:
c40878	Do not let Hezekiah deceive you;
c40879	he cannot
c40880	deliver you from my hand.
c40881	Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD
c40882	when he says,
c40883	‘The LORD will surely deliver us;
c40884	this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
c40885	Do not listen to Hezekiah,
c40886	for this is what the king of Assyria says:
c40887	Make peace with me
c40888	and come out to me.
c40889	Then every one of you will eat from his own vine
c40890	his own fig tree, [and]
c40891	drink water from his own cistern,
c40892	until I come
c40893	and take you away to a land like your own land— a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey—
c40894	so that you may live
c40895	and not die.
c40896	But do not listen to Hezekiah,
c40897	for he misleads you
c40898	when he says,
c40899	“The LORD will deliver us.”
c40900	Has the god ... nation ever delivered
c40901	of any ... his land
c40902	from the hand of the king of Assyria?
c40903	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?
c40904	Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?
c40905	Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
c40906	Who among all the gods of these lands
c40907	has delivered his land from my hand?
c40908	How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’”
c40909	But the people remained silent
c40910	and did not answer a word,
c40911	for [Hezekiah] had commanded,
c40913	“Do not answer him.”
c40914	Then Hilkiah's son Eliakim ... came
c40915	the palace administrator,
c40916	Shebna the scribe, and Asaph's son Joah the recorder, ... to Hezekiah with their clothes torn,
c40917	and they relayed to him the words of [the] Rab-shakeh.
c40918	On
c40919	hearing [this report], King Hezekiah
c40920	tore his clothes,
c40921	put on sackcloth,
c40922	and entered the house of the LORD.
c40923	Then he sent Eliakim
c40924	the palace administrator,
c40925	Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests,
c40926	all wearing sackcloth,
c40927	to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz
c40928	to tell him,
c40929	“This is what Hezekiah says:
c40930	Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace;
c40931	for the children have come to the point of birth,
c40932	but there is no strength to deliver them.
c40933	Perhaps the LORD your God will hear all the words of the Rab-shakeh,
c40934	whom his master the king of Assyria has sent
c40935	to defy the living God,
c40936	and He will rebuke him for the words
c40937	that the LORD your God has heard.
c40938	Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant
c40939	that still survives.”
c40940	So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah,
c40941	who replied,
c40942	“Tell your master that this is what
c40943	the LORD says:
c40944	‘Do not be afraid of the words
c40945	you have heard,
c40946	with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
c40947	Behold, I will put a spirit in him
c40948	so that he will hear a rumor
c40949	and return to his own land,
c40950	where I will cause him to fall by the sword.’”
c40951	the Rab-shakeh ... he withdrew
c40952	the king of Assyria ... and found
c40953	[the king] fighting against Libnah.
c40954	When ... heard
c40955	that ... had left Lachish,
c40956	Now Sennacherib had been warned about Tirhakah king of Cush:
c40958	“Look, he has set out
c40959	to fight against you.”
c40960	So again Sennacherib
c40961	sent messengers to Hezekiah
c40962	with the order:
c40963	“Tell Hezekiah king of Judah:
c40964	by saying
c40965	‘Do not let your God, ... deceive you
c40966	in whom you trust,
c40968	that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
c40969	Surely you have heard
c40970	what the kings of Assyria have done to all [the other] countries,
c40971	destroying them completely.
c40972	Will you then be spared?
c40973	Did the gods of the nations ... rescue them— [the gods of]
c40974	my fathers have destroyed
c40975	Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden
c40976	who [were] in Telassar?
c40977	Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”
c40978	So Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers,
c40979	read it,
c40980	and went up to the house of the LORD
c40981	and spread it out before the LORD.
c40982	And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD:
c40984	“O LORD, God of Israel,
c40985	enthroned between the cherubim,
c40986	You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth.
c40987	You made the heavens and the earth.
c40988	Incline
c40989	O LORD,
c40990	Your ear,
c40991	and hear;
c40992	open
c40993	O LORD,
c40994	Your eyes,
c40995	and see.
c40996	Listen to the words ... Sennacherib
c40997	that ... has sent
c40998	to defy the living God.
c40999	Truly, O LORD,
c41000	the kings of Assyria have laid waste these nations and their lands.
c41001	They have cast their gods into the fire
c41002	for they were not gods
c41003	but only wood and stone— the work of human hands.
c41004	and destroyed them,
c41005	And now,
c41006	O LORD our God,
c41007	please deliver us from his hand,
c41008	so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know
c41009	that You alone, O LORD, are God.”
c41010	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah:
c41012	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c41013	your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria.
c41014	I have heard
c41015	This is the word
c41016	the LORD has spoken against him:
c41017	despises you
c41018	‘The virgin Daughter of Zion ... and mocks you;
c41019	the Daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you.
c41020	Whom have you taunted
c41021	and blasphemed?
c41022	Against whom have you raised your voice
c41023	and lifted your eyes in pride?
c41024	Against the Holy One of Israel!
c41025	Through your servants you have taunted the Lord
c41026	and you have said:
c41027	“With my many chariots I have ascended to the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon.
c41028	I have cut down its tallest cedars, the finest of its cypress trees.
c41029	I have reached its farthest outposts, the densest of its forests.
c41030	I have dug wells
c41031	and drunk foreign waters.
c41032	With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.”
c41033	Have you not heard? Long ago
c41034	I ordained it; in days of old
c41035	I planned it.
c41036	Now I have brought it to pass,
c41037	that you should crush
c41038	fortified cities into piles of rubble.
c41039	Therefore their inhabitants, devoid of power,
c41040	are dismayed
c41041	and ashamed.
c41042	They are like plants in the field, tender green shoots,
c41043	grass on the rooftops, scorched before it is grown.
c41045	your sitting down,
c41046	your going out
c41047	and coming in,
c41048	But I know
c41050	and your raging against Me.
c41051	Because your rage ... against Me
c41052	and arrogance ... have reached My ears,
c41053	I will put My hook in your nose
c41054	and My bit in your mouth;
c41055	I will send you back the way
c41056	you came.’
c41057	And this will be a sign to you, [O Hezekiah]:
c41058	This year you will eat what grows on its own,
c41059	and in the second year what springs from the same.
c41060	But in the third year you will sow
c41061	and reap;
c41062	you will plant vineyards
c41063	and eat their fruit.
c41064	And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root below
c41065	and bear fruit above.
c41066	For a remnant will go forth from Jerusalem,
c41067	and survivors from Mount Zion.
c41068	The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.
c41069	So
c41070	this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria:
c41071	‘He will not enter this city
c41072	or shoot an arrow into it.
c41073	He will not come before it with a shield
c41074	[or] build up a siege ramp against it.
c41075	the way
c41076	he came,
c41077	He will go back
c41078	and he will not enter this city,
c41079	declares the LORD.
c41080	I will defend this city
c41081	and rescue it
c41082	for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.’”
c41083	And that very night
c41084	the angel of the LORD went out
c41085	and struck down 185,000men in the camp of the Assyrians.
c41086	When the people got up the next morning,
c41087	there were all the dead bodies!
c41088	broke camp
c41089	and withdrew.
c41090	So Sennacherib king of Assyria ... He returned
c41091	to Nineveh and stayed there.
c41092	One day,
c41093	while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch,
c41094	his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword
c41095	and escaped to the land of Ararat.
c41096	And his son Esar-haddon became king in his place.
c41097	In those days Hezekiah ... ill.
c41098	became mortally
c41099	The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him
c41100	and said,
c41101	“This is what the LORD says:
c41102	‘Put your house in order,
c41103	for you are about to die;
c41104	you will not recover.’”
c41105	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall
c41106	and prayed to the LORD,
c41108	“Please, O LORD,
c41109	remember
c41110	how I have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion;
c41111	I have done [what is] good in Your sight.”
c41112	And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
c41113	came
c41114	Before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard,
c41115	the word of the LORD ... to him,
c41116	saying,
c41117	“Go back
c41118	and tell Hezekiah, the leader of My people,
c41119	‘This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says:
c41120	I have heard your prayer;
c41121	I have seen your tears.
c41122	I will surely heal you.
c41123	On the third day from now you will go up to the house of the LORD.
c41124	I will add fifteen years to your life,
c41125	and I will deliver you ... from the hand of the king of Assyria.
c41126	and this city
c41127	I will defend this city for My sake and for the sake of My servant David.’”
c41128	Then Isaiah said,
c41129	“Prepare a poultice of figs.”
c41130	So they brought it
c41131	and applied it to the boil,
c41132	and he recovered.
c41133	Now Hezekiah had asked Isaiah,
c41134	“What is the sign
c41135	that the LORD will heal
c41136	me and that I will go up to the house of the LORD on the third day?”
c41137	And Isaiah replied,
c41138	“This will be a sign to you from the LORD
c41139	that He will do
c41140	what He has promised:
c41141	[Would you like] the shadow to go forward ten steps,
c41142	or back ten steps?”
c41143	answered Hezekiah,
c41144	“It is easy for the shadow
c41145	to lengthen ten steps,”
c41146	“but not
c41147	for it to go back ten steps.”
c41148	So Isaiah the prophet called out to the LORD,
c41149	and He brought the shadow
c41150	steps it had descended ... of Ahaz.
c41151	back the ten ... on the stairway
c41152	At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah,
c41153	for he had heard
c41154	about Hezekiah’s illness.
c41155	And Hezekiah received the messengers
c41156	and showed them all that was in his treasure house— the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil— along with his armory and everything
c41157	that was found in his storehouses.
c41158	There was nothing
c41159	that Hezekiah did not show them.
c41160	in his palace or in all his dominion
c41161	Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah
c41162	and asked, ... to you?”
c41163	did those men ... and what did they say
c41164	“From where ... come,
c41165	Hezekiah replied,
c41166	“They came from a distant land,” ... “from Babylon.”
c41167	Isaiah asked.
c41168	“What have they seen in your palace?”
c41169	answered Hezekiah.
c41170	everything
c41171	in my palace,” ... that
c41172	“They have seen
c41173	“There is nothing
c41174	I did not show them.”
c41175	among my treasures
c41176	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah,
c41177	“Hear the word of the LORD:
c41178	The time will surely come
c41179	when everything ... will be carried off
c41180	in your palace and all that
c41181	your fathers have stored up until this day
c41182	to Babylon.
c41183	Nothing will be left,
c41184	says the LORD.
c41185	your descendants,
c41186	And some of ... your own flesh and blood,
c41188	will be taken away
c41189	to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
c41190	But Hezekiah said to Isaiah,
c41191	“The word of the LORD ... is good.”
c41192	that you have spoken
c41193	For he thought,
c41194	“Will there not
c41195	at least be peace and security in my lifetime?”
c41196	As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, along with all his might
c41197	and how he constructed the pool and the tunnel
c41198	to bring water into the city,
c41199	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c41200	And Hezekiah rested with his fathers,
c41201	and his son Manasseh became king in his place.
c41202	Manasseh was twelve years old
c41203	when he became king,
c41204	and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years.
c41205	His mother’s name was Hephzibah.
c41206	And he did
c41207	evil in the sight of the LORD
c41208	by following the abominations of the nations
c41209	that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
c41210	For he rebuilt
c41211	the high places
c41212	that his father Hezekiah had destroyed,
c41213	and he raised up altars for Baal.
c41214	He made an Asherah pole,
c41215	as King Ahab of Israel had done,
c41216	and he worshiped ... all the host of heaven.
c41217	and served
c41218	[Manasseh] also built altars in the house of the LORD,
c41219	of which the LORD had said,
c41220	“In Jerusalem I will put My Name.”
c41221	In both courtyards of the house of the LORD, he built altars to all the host of heaven.
c41222	He sacrificed his own son in the fire,
c41223	practiced sorcery
c41224	and divination,
c41225	and consulted mediums and spiritists.
c41226	great
c41227	He did
c41228	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c41229	provoking Him to anger.
c41230	Manasseh even took the carved Asherah pole ... and set it up
c41231	he had made
c41232	in the temple,
c41233	of which the LORD had said to David and his son Solomon,
c41234	“In this temple and in Jerusalem,
c41235	which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel,
c41236	I will establish My Name forever.
c41237	I will never again
c41238	cause the feet of the Israelites to wander from the land
c41239	I gave their fathers, ... that
c41240	if only they are careful
c41241	to do all
c41242	I have commanded them—
c41243	the whole Law
c41244	My servant Moses commanded them.”
c41245	But [the people] did not listen
c41246	and Manasseh led them astray,
c41247	so that they did
c41248	greater evil than the nations
c41249	the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
c41250	And the LORD spoke through His servants the prophets,
c41251	saying,
c41252	“Since Manasseh king of Judah has committed ... these abominations,
c41253	all ... acting more wickedly
c41254	than the Amorites who
c41255	preceded him,
c41256	and with his idols has caused Judah to sin,
c41258	this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c41259	‘Behold, I am bringing [such] calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah
c41260	that [the news] ... of all who hear it.
c41261	will reverberate in the ears
c41262	I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab,
c41263	and I will wipe out Jerusalem
c41264	as one wipes out a bowl—
c41265	wiping [it]
c41266	and turning [it] upside down.
c41267	So I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance
c41268	and deliver them into the hand of their enemies.
c41269	And they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies,
c41270	because they have done evil in My sight
c41271	and have provoked Me {to anger} from the day
c41272	their fathers came out of Egypt
c41273	until this day.’”
c41274	Moreover, Manasseh shed so much innocent blood
c41275	that he filled Jerusalem from end to end, in addition to the sin
c41276	that he had caused Judah to commit,
c41277	doing
c41278	evil in the sight of the LORD.
c41279	As for the rest of the acts of Manasseh, along with all
c41280	his accomplishments
c41281	and the sin
c41282	that he committed,
c41283	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c41284	And Manasseh rested with his fathers
c41285	and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza.
c41286	And his son Amon became king in his place.
c41287	Amon was twenty-two years old
c41288	when he became king,
c41289	and he reigned in Jerusalem two years.
c41290	His mother’s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah.
c41291	And he did
c41292	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c41293	as his father Manasseh had done.
c41294	He walked in all the ways
c41295	of his father,
c41296	and he served ... the idols
c41297	his father had served.
c41298	and worshiped
c41299	He abandoned the LORD, the God of his fathers,
c41300	and did not walk in the way of the LORD.
c41301	Then the servants of Amon conspired against him
c41302	and killed the king in his palace.
c41303	But the people of the land killed all
c41304	who had conspired against King Amon,
c41305	and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
c41306	As for the rest of the acts of Amon,
c41307	along with his accomplishments,
c41308	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c41309	And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza,
c41310	and his son Josiah became king in his place.
c41311	Josiah was eight years old
c41312	when he became king,
c41313	and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years.
c41314	His mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath.
c41315	And he did
c41316	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD
c41317	and walked in all the ways of David his forefather;
c41318	he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.
c41319	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, ... Josiah
c41320	King ... sent the scribe, Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the house of the LORD,
c41321	saying,
c41322	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest
c41323	and have him count the money
c41324	that has been brought into the house of the LORD,
c41325	which the doorkeepers have collected from the people.
c41326	And let them deliver it into the hands ... of those doing the work
c41327	of the supervisors ... on the house of the LORD,
c41328	who in turn are to give it to the workmen
c41329	to the house of the LORD—
c41330	repairing the damages
c41331	to the carpenters, builders, and masons—
c41332	to buy timber and dressed stone
c41333	to repair the temple.
c41334	But they need not account for the money
c41335	put into their hands,
c41336	since they work with integrity.”
c41337	Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe,
c41338	“I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD!”
c41339	And he gave [it] to Shaphan,
c41340	who read it.
c41341	And Shaphan the scribe went to the king
c41342	and reported,
c41344	“Your servants have paid out the money
c41345	that was found in the temple
c41346	and have put it into the hands of the workers
c41347	and supervisors of the house of the LORD.”
c41348	Moreover , Shaphan the scribe told the king,
c41350	“Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.”
c41351	And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
c41353	When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law,
c41354	he tore his clothes
c41355	[and] commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king:
c41357	“Go
c41358	and inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah concerning the words in this book that has been found.
c41359	For great [is] the wrath of the LORD
c41360	that burns against us
c41361	because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book ... about us.”
c41362	by doing all
c41363	that is written
c41364	So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went ... to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas,
c41365	the keeper of the wardrobe.
c41366	She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.
c41367	and spoke
c41368	And [Huldah] said to them,
c41369	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c41370	‘Tell the man
c41371	who sent you
c41372	that this is what the LORD says:
c41373	I am about to bring calamity on this place and on its people, according to all the words of the book
c41374	that the king of Judah has read,
c41375	because they have forsaken Me
c41376	and burned incense to other gods,
c41377	that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands.
c41378	My wrath will be kindled against this place
c41379	and will not be quenched.’
c41380	But as for the king of Judah,
c41381	who sent you
c41382	to inquire of the LORD,
c41383	tell him
c41384	that this is what the LORD, God of Israel, says:
c41385	‘As for the words
c41386	that you heard,
c41387	because your heart was tender
c41388	and you humbled yourself before the LORD
c41389	when you heard
c41390	what I spoke against this place and against its people,
c41391	that they would become a desolation and a curse,
c41392	and because you have torn your clothes
c41393	and wept before Me,
c41394	I have heard [you],’
c41395	declares the LORD.
c41396	‘Therefore
c41397	I will indeed gather you to your fathers,
c41398	and you will be gathered to your grave in peace.
c41399	Your eyes will not see all the calamity
c41400	that I will bring on this place.’”
c41401	So they brought her answer back to the king.
c41402	Then the king summoned
c41403	all the elders of Jerusalem and Judah.
c41404	And [he] went up to the house of the LORD
c41405	with all the people of Judah [and] Jerusalem, as well as
c41406	the priests and the prophets— all the people small and great—
c41407	and in their hearing he read all the words of the Book of the Covenant
c41408	that had been found in the house of the LORD.
c41409	So the king stood by the pillar
c41410	and made a covenant before the LORD
c41411	to follow the LORD
c41412	and to keep His commandments, decrees, and statutes with all [his] heart and all [his] soul,
c41413	and to carry out the words of this covenant
c41414	that were written in this book.
c41415	And all the people entered into the covenant.
c41416	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests second in rank, and the doorkeepers
c41417	to remove from the temple of the LORD all the articles
c41418	made for Baal, Asherah, and all the host of heaven.
c41419	And he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron
c41420	and carried their ashes to Bethel.
c41421	[Josiah] also did away with the idolatrous priests
c41422	ordained by the kings of Judah
c41423	to burn incense on the high places of the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem—
c41424	those who had burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven.
c41425	He brought the Asherah pole from the house of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem,
c41426	and [there] he burned it,
c41427	ground [it] to powder,
c41428	and threw its dust on the graves of the common people.
c41429	He also tore down the quarters of the male cult prostitutes
c41430	that [were] in the house of the LORD,
c41431	where the women had woven tapestries for Asherah.
c41432	Then Josiah brought all the priests from the cities of Judah
c41433	and desecrated the high places,
c41434	where the priests had burned incense.
c41435	from Geba to Beersheba,
c41436	He tore down the high places of the gates
c41437	at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city,
c41438	which was to the left of the city gate.
c41439	Although the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem,
c41440	they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests.
c41441	He also desecrated Topheth
c41442	in the Valley of Ben-hinnom
c41443	so that no one could sacrifice his son or daughter in the fire to Molech.
c41444	And he removed ... the horses
c41445	that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun.
c41446	from the entrance to the house of the LORD
c41447	near the chamber of an official named Nathan-melech.
c41448	They were in the court
c41449	And [Josiah] burned up the chariots of the sun.
c41450	the altars
c41451	on the roof near the upper chamber of Ahaz,
c41452	that the kings of Judah had set up
c41453	and the altars
c41454	Manasseh had set up in the two courtyards of the house of the LORD.
c41455	He pulled down ... The king
c41456	pulverized them there
c41457	and threw their dust into the Kidron Valley.
c41458	the high places
c41459	east of Jerusalem,
c41460	to the south of the Mount of Corruption, which
c41461	The king ... Solomon of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites.
c41462	also desecrated ... King
c41463	He smashed the sacred pillars to pieces,
c41464	cut down the Asherah poles,
c41465	and covered the sites with human bones.
c41466	He even ... the altar
c41467	at Bethel,
c41468	the high place
c41469	set up by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who
c41470	had caused Israel to sin.
c41471	pulled down ... the high place,
c41472	Then he burned
c41473	ground [it] to powder,
c41474	and burned the Asherah pole.
c41475	And as Josiah turned,
c41476	he saw the tombs
c41477	there on the hillside, ... who
c41478	and he sent
c41479	someone to take the bones out of the tombs,
c41480	and he burned them on the altar
c41481	to defile it,
c41482	according to the word the LORD
c41483	proclaimed by the man of God
c41484	had foretold these things.
c41485	Then [the king] asked,
c41486	“What is this monument
c41487	I see?” ... who
c41488	And the men of the city replied,
c41489	“It is the tomb of the man of God
c41490	came from Judah ... that
c41491	and pronounced these things
c41492	you have done
c41493	to the altar of Bethel.”
c41494	said [Josiah].
c41495	“Let him rest,”
c41496	“Do not let anyone disturb his bones.”
c41497	So they left his bones undisturbed, along with those of the prophet
c41498	who had come from Samaria.
c41499	also ... all the shrines of the high places
c41500	in the cities of Samaria,
c41501	which the kings of Israel had set up
c41502	provoking the LORD to anger.
c41503	[he] ... removed
c41504	Just as Josiah
c41505	had done at Bethel,
c41506	he slaughtered all the priests of the high places,
c41508	On the altars
c41509	and he burned human bones on them.
c41510	Then he returned to Jerusalem.
c41511	The king commanded all the people,
c41513	“Keep the Passover of the LORD your God,
c41514	as [it is] written in this Book of the Covenant.”
c41515	No such Passover had been observed from the days of the judges
c41516	who had governed Israel
c41517	through all the days of the kings of Israel and Judah.
c41518	But in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was observed to the LORD in Jerusalem.
c41519	Furthermore, ... the mediums and spiritists, the household gods and idols, and all the abominations
c41520	that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem.
c41521	Josiah removed
c41522	He did this to carry out the words of the law
c41523	written in the book
c41524	that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of the LORD.
c41525	Neither before ... any king like him,
c41526	who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, according to all the Law of Moses.
c41527	nor after [Josiah] was there
c41528	Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn away from the fury of His burning anger,
c41529	which was kindled against Judah
c41530	because of all ... had done
c41531	that Manasseh ... to provoke Him to anger.
c41532	For the LORD had said,
c41533	“I will also remove Judah from My sight,
c41534	just as I have removed Israel.
c41535	I will reject this city
c41536	which I have chosen,
c41537	Jerusalem, ... and the temple
c41538	of which I said,
c41539	‘My Name shall be there.’”
c41540	As for the rest of the acts of Josiah, along with all
c41541	his accomplishments,
c41542	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c41543	At the end of [Josiah's] reign, Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt marched up to help the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River.
c41544	King Josiah went out
c41545	to confront him,
c41546	and killed him at Megiddo.
c41547	but Neco faced him
c41548	From Megiddo his servants carried his body in a chariot,
c41549	brought him to Jerusalem,
c41550	and buried him in his own tomb.
c41551	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah,
c41552	anointed him,
c41553	and made him king in place of his father.
c41554	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old
c41555	when he became king,
c41556	and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.
c41557	His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
c41558	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as
c41559	his forefathers had done.
c41560	And Pharaoh Neco imprisoned Jehoahaz at Riblah in the land of Hamath
c41561	so that he could not reign in Jerusalem,
c41562	and he imposed on [Judah] a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
c41563	Then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah,
c41564	and he changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim.
c41565	But Neco took Jehoahaz
c41566	and carried him off to Egypt,
c41567	where he died.
c41568	So Jehoiakim paid the silver and gold to Pharaoh [Neco],
c41569	but ... he taxed the land
c41570	to meet Pharaoh's demand
c41571	each according to his wealth.
c41572	and exacted the silver and the gold from the people,
c41574	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old
c41575	when he became king,
c41576	and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.
c41577	His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah.
c41578	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as
c41579	his fathers had done.
c41580	During Jehoiakim’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded.
c41581	So Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years,
c41582	until he turned
c41583	and rebelled against [Nebuchadnezzar].
c41584	And the LORD sent Chaldean, Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite [raiders] against Jehoiakim
c41585	[in order] ... Judah,
c41586	to destroy
c41587	according to the word the LORD
c41588	had spoken through His servants the prophets.
c41589	Surely this happened to Judah at the LORD’s command,
c41590	to remove them from His presence
c41591	because of the sins of Manasseh and all
c41592	that he had done,
c41593	and also for the innocent blood
c41594	he had shed.
c41595	For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood,
c41596	and the LORD was unwilling
c41597	to forgive.
c41598	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, along with all
c41599	his accomplishments,
c41600	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
c41601	And Jehoiakim rested with his fathers,
c41602	and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place.
c41603	Now the king of Egypt did not ... again,
c41604	march out of his land
c41605	because the king of Babylon had taken all ... from the Brook ... to the Euphrates River.
c41606	his territory, ... of Egypt
c41607	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old
c41608	when he became king,
c41609	and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.
c41610	His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem.
c41611	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as
c41612	his father had done.
c41613	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched up to Jerusalem,
c41614	and the city came under siege.
c41615	And King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city
c41616	while his servants were besieging it.
c41617	Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his commanders, and his officials [all] surrendered to the king of Babylon.
c41618	So in the eighth year ... the king of Babylon took him captive.
c41619	of [Jehoiachin's] reign,
c41620	[Nebuchadnezzar] also carried off all the treasures from the house of the LORD [and] the royal palace,
c41621	and he cut into pieces all the gold articles
c41622	that Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD.
c41623	As the LORD had declared,
c41624	He carried into exile all Jerusalem— all the commanders and mighty warriors, all the craftsmen and metalsmiths— ten thousand captives [in all].
c41625	Only the poorest people of the land remained.
c41626	Nebuchadnezzar carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon,
c41627	as well as the king’s mother, [his] wives, his officials, and the leading men of the land. He took them into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
c41628	all seven thousand valiant warriors and a thousand craftsmen and metalsmiths—
c41629	all strong and fit for battle.
c41630	The king of Babylon also brought into exile to Babylon
c41631	Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, [Jehoiachin's] uncle, king in his place
c41632	and changed his name to Zedekiah.
c41633	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old
c41634	when he became king,
c41635	and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.
c41636	His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
c41637	And [Zedekiah] did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as
c41638	Jehoiakim had done.
c41639	For because of the anger of the LORD, [all this] happened in Jerusalem and Judah,
c41640	until He finally banished them from His presence.
c41641	And Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon.
c41642	So in the ninth year
c41643	of Zedekiah’s reign,
c41644	on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army.
c41645	They encamped outside [the city]
c41646	and built a siege wall all around it.
c41647	And the city was kept under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
c41648	By the ninth [day] of the [fourth] month,
c41649	the famine in the city was so severe
c41650	that the people of the land had no food.
c41651	Then the city was breached;
c41652	all the men of war fled by night by way of the gate between the two walls
c41653	near the king’s garden.
c41654	and though the Chaldeans had surrounded the city,
c41655	They fled toward the Arabah,
c41656	but the army of the Chaldeans pursued [the king]
c41657	and overtook him in the plains of Jericho,
c41658	and all his army was separated from him.
c41659	The Chaldeans seized the king
c41660	and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah,
c41661	where they pronounced judgment on him.
c41662	And they slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes.
c41663	Then they put out [his] eyes,
c41664	bound him in bronze shackles,
c41665	and took him to Babylon.
c41666	On the seventh day of the fifth month,
c41667	in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign over Babylon, ... of the king
c41668	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant ... of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
c41669	He burned down the house of the LORD, the royal palace,
c41670	and all the houses of Jerusalem— every significant building.
c41671	And the whole army of the Chaldeans ... broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
c41672	under the commander of the guard
c41673	the people
c41674	who remained in the city,
c41675	along with the deserters
c41676	who had defected to the king of Babylon
c41677	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile ... and the rest of the population.
c41678	But the captain of the guard left behind some of the poorest of the land to tend the vineyards and fields.
c41679	Moreover, ... the bronze pillars
c41680	in the house of the LORD,
c41681	and the stands and the bronze sea
c41683	the Chaldeans broke up
c41684	and they carried the bronze to Babylon.
c41685	the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the articles of bronze
c41686	used in temple service.
c41687	They also took away
c41688	the censers and sprinkling bowls—
c41689	anything [made of] pure gold
c41690	or fine silver.
c41691	The captain of the guard also took away
c41692	As for the two pillars, the Sea, and the movable stands
c41693	that Solomon had made for the house of the LORD,
c41694	{the weight} of the bronze from all these articles [was beyond] measure.
c41695	Each pillar was eighteen cubits tall.
c41696	The bronze capital atop [one pillar]
c41697	was three cubits high,
c41698	with a network ... pomegranates ... around.
c41699	of bronze ... all
c41700	The second pillar, with its network, was similar.
c41701	The captain of the guard also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three doorkeepers.
c41702	Of those still in the city, he took a court official
c41703	who had been appointed over the men of war
c41704	and five royal advisors,
c41706	as well as the scribe of the captain of the army,
c41707	who enlisted the people of the land,
c41708	and sixty men
c41709	[who were] found in the city.
c41710	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them
c41711	and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
c41712	the king of Babylon struck them {down}
c41713	There at Riblah in the land of Hamath, ... and put them to death.
c41714	So Judah was taken into exile, away from her land.
c41715	the people
c41716	in the land of Judah.
c41717	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ... he had left behind
c41718	appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over
c41719	When all the commanders of the armies and their men heard
c41720	that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah {as governor},
c41721	they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—
c41722	Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite, as well as their men.
c41723	And Gedaliah took an oath before them and their men,
c41724	assuring them,
c41725	“Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans.
c41726	Live in the land
c41727	and serve the king of Babylon,
c41728	and it will be well with you.”
c41729	In the seventh month, however, ... were
c41730	Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came
c41731	with ten men
c41732	and struck down ... Gedaliah,
c41733	and killed
c41734	along with the Judeans and Chaldeans
c41735	who ... with him at Mizpah.
c41736	Then all the people small and great, together with the commanders of the army, arose
c41737	and fled to Egypt
c41738	for fear of the Chaldeans.
c41739	On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King Jehoiachin,
c41740	Evil-merodach became king of Babylon, he released
c41741	in the year
c41742	King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison.
c41743	And he spoke kindly to Jehoiachin
c41744	and set his throne over the thrones of the kings
c41745	who were with him in Babylon.
c41746	So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes,
c41747	and for the rest of his life he dined regularly before the [king].
c41749	And the king provided [Jehoiachin] a daily portion for the rest of his life.
c41750	[This is] the vision ... Isaiah son of Amoz
c41751	concerning Judah and Jerusalem that ... saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
c41752	Listen,
c41753	O heavens,
c41754	and give ear,
c41755	O earth,
c41756	for the LORD has spoken:
c41757	“I have raised children
c41758	and brought them up,
c41759	but they have rebelled against Me.
c41760	The ox knows its owner,
c41761	and the donkey its master’s manger,
c41762	but Israel does not know;
c41763	My people do not understand.”
c41764	Alas, O sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a brood of evildoers, children of depravity!
c41765	They have forsaken the LORD;
c41766	they have despised the Holy One of Israel
c41767	[and] turned their backs on Him.
c41768	Why do you want more beatings?
c41769	Why do you keep rebelling?
c41770	Your head has a massive wound,
c41771	and your whole heart is afflicted.
c41772	From the sole of your foot to the top of your head, [there is] no soundness—
c41773	only wounds and welts and festering sores
c41774	not cleansed
c41775	[or] bandaged
c41776	or soothed with oil.
c41777	Your land is desolate,
c41778	your cities [are] burned with fire;
c41779	your fields
c41780	foreigners devour ... before you;
c41781	a desolation is demolished by strangers.
c41782	And the daughter of Zion is abandoned like a shelter in a vineyard, like a shack in a cucumber field, like a city besieged.
c41783	Unless the LORD of Hosts had left us a few survivors,
c41784	we would have become like Sodom,
c41785	we would have resembled Gomorrah.
c41786	Hear the word of the LORD,
c41787	you rulers of Sodom;
c41788	listen to the instruction of our God,
c41789	you people of Gomorrah!
c41790	“What is your multitude of sacrifices to Me?”
c41791	says the LORD.
c41792	“I am full from the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed cattle;
c41793	I take no delight in the blood of bulls, of lambs and goats.
c41794	When you come
c41795	to appear before Me,
c41796	who has required this of you—
c41797	this trampling of My courts?
c41798	no more;
c41799	Bring your worthless offerings
c41800	your incense is detestable to Me—
c41801	[your] New Moons, Sabbaths,
c41802	and convocations—
c41803	I cannot endure iniquity in a solemn assembly.
c41804	I hate your New Moons and your appointed feasts;
c41805	they have become a burden to Me;
c41806	I am weary
c41807	of bearing them.
c41809	When you spread out your hands in prayer,
c41810	I will hide My eyes from you;
c41811	even though you multiply your prayers,
c41812	I will not listen.
c41813	Your hands are covered with blood.
c41814	Wash
c41815	and cleanse yourselves.
c41816	Remove your evil deeds from My sight.
c41817	Stop
c41818	doing evil!
c41819	Learn
c41820	to do right,
c41821	seek justice,
c41822	correct the oppressor,
c41823	defend the fatherless,
c41824	plead for the widow.”
c41825	“Come now,
c41826	let us reason together,”
c41827	says the LORD.
c41828	“Though your sins are like scarlet,
c41829	they will be as white as snow;
c41830	though they are as red as crimson,
c41831	they will become like wool.
c41832	If you are willing
c41833	and obedient,
c41834	you will eat the best of the land.
c41835	But if you resist
c41836	and rebel,
c41837	you will be devoured by the sword.”
c41838	For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
c41839	[See] how the faithful city has become a harlot!
c41840	She once was full of justice;
c41841	righteousness resided within her,
c41842	but now only murderers!
c41843	Your silver has become dross,
c41844	your fine wine is diluted with water.
c41845	Your rulers are rebels, friends of thieves.
c41846	They all love bribes
c41847	and chasing after rewards.
c41848	They do not defend the fatherless,
c41849	and the plea of the widow never comes before them.
c41850	Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, declares:
c41851	“Ah, I will be relieved of My foes
c41852	and avenge Myself on My enemies.
c41853	I will turn My hand against you;
c41854	I will thoroughly purge your dross;
c41855	I will remove all your impurities.
c41856	I will restore your judges as at the first,
c41857	and your counselors as at the beginning.
c41858	After that you will be called
c41859	the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.”
c41860	Zion will be redeemed with justice,
c41861	her repentant ones with righteousness.
c41862	But rebels and sinners will together be shattered,
c41863	and those who forsake the LORD will perish.
c41864	Surely you will be ashamed of the sacred oaks
c41865	in which you have delighted;
c41866	you will be embarrassed by the gardens
c41867	that you have chosen.
c41868	For you will become like an oak whose leaves are withered,
c41869	like a garden
c41870	without water.
c41871	The strong man will become tinder
c41872	and his work [will be] a spark;
c41873	both will burn together,
c41874	with no one to quench the flames.
c41875	[This is] the message
c41876	that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
c41877	In the last days ... will be
c41878	the mountain of the house of the LORD ... established as the chief of the mountains;
c41879	it will be raised above the hills,
c41880	and all nations will stream to it.
c41881	And many peoples will come
c41882	and say,
c41883	“Come,
c41884	let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob.
c41885	He will teach us His ways
c41886	so that we may walk in His paths.”
c41887	For the law will go forth from Zion,
c41888	and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
c41889	Then He will judge between the nations
c41890	and arbitrate for many peoples.
c41891	They will beat their swords into plowshares
c41892	and their spears into pruning hooks.
c41893	Nation will no longer take up the sword against nation,
c41894	nor train anymore for war.
c41895	O house of Jacob,
c41896	Come,
c41897	let us walk in the light of the LORD.
c41898	For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob,
c41899	because they are filled [with influences] from the east;
c41900	they are soothsayers like the Philistines;
c41901	they strike [hands] with the children of foreigners.
c41902	Their land is full of silver and gold,
c41903	with no limit to their treasures;
c41904	their land is full of horses,
c41905	with no limit to their chariots.
c41906	Their land is full of idols;
c41907	they bow down to the work of their hands,
c41908	to what their fingers have made.
c41909	So mankind is brought low,
c41910	and man is humbled—
c41911	do not forgive them!
c41912	Go into the rocks
c41913	and hide in the dust from the terror of the LORD and the splendor of His majesty.
c41914	The proud look of man will be humbled,
c41915	and the loftiness of men brought low;
c41916	the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
c41917	For the Day of the LORD of Hosts [will come] against all the proud and lofty,
c41918	against all that is exalted— it will be humbled—
c41919	against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up,
c41920	against all the oaks of Bashan,
c41921	against all the tall mountains,
c41922	against all the high hills,
c41923	against every high tower,
c41924	against every fortified wall,
c41925	against every ship of Tarshish,
c41926	[and] every stately vessel.
c41927	So the pride of man will be brought low,
c41928	and the loftiness of men will be humbled;
c41929	the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,
c41930	and the idols will vanish completely.
c41931	Men will flee to caves in the rocks and holes in the ground, away from the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty,
c41932	when He rises
c41933	to shake the earth.
c41934	In that day men will cast away their idols of silver and gold—
c41935	[the idols] they made
c41936	to worship—
c41937	away to the moles
c41938	and bats.
c41939	They will flee to caverns in the rocks and crevices in the cliffs, away from the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty,
c41940	when He rises
c41941	to shake the earth.
c41942	Put no more trust in man,
c41943	who has only the breath in his nostrils.
c41944	Of what account is he?
c41945	For behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts is about to remove from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: the whole supply of bread and water,
c41946	the mighty man and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the soothsayer and the elder,
c41947	the commander of fifty and the dignitary, the counselor, the cunning magician, and the clever enchanter.
c41948	“I will make mere lads their leaders,
c41949	and children will rule over them.”
c41950	The people will oppress one another,
c41951	man against man,
c41952	neighbor against neighbor;
c41953	the young will rise up against the old,
c41954	and the base against the honorable.
c41955	A man will seize his brother within his father’s house:
c41956	“You have a cloak—
c41957	you be our leader!
c41958	Take charge of this heap of rubble.”
c41959	On that day he will cry aloud:
c41961	“I am not a healer.
c41962	I have no food ... in my house.
c41963	or clothing
c41964	Do not make me leader of the people!”
c41965	For Jerusalem has stumbled
c41966	and Judah has fallen
c41967	because they spoke and acted against the LORD,
c41968	defying His glorious presence.
c41969	The expression on their faces testifies against them,
c41970	and like Sodom they flaunt their sin;
c41971	they do not conceal it;
c41972	woe to them,
c41973	for they have brought disaster upon themselves.
c41974	Tell the righteous
c41975	it will be well
c41976	for them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their labor.
c41977	Woe to the wicked;
c41978	disaster is
c41979	upon them! For they will be repaid with what their hands have done.
c41980	My people,
c41981	Youths oppress
c41982	and women rule over them.
c41983	O My people,
c41984	your guides mislead you;
c41985	they turn you from your paths.
c41986	arises
c41987	to contend;
c41988	The LORD
c41989	He stands
c41990	to judge the people.
c41991	The LORD brings this charge against the elders and leaders of His people:
c41992	“You have devoured the vineyard;
c41993	the plunder of the poor is in your houses.
c41995	Why do you crush My people
c41996	and grind the faces of the poor?”
c41997	declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.
c41998	The LORD says,
c41999	“Because the daughters of Zion are haughty—
c42000	walking with heads held high and wanton eyes,
c42001	prancing and skipping as they go,
c42002	jingling the bracelets on their ankles—
c42003	the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the daughters of Zion,
c42004	and the LORD will make their foreheads bare.
c42005	In that day the Lord will take away the finery of [their] anklets and headbands and crescents,
c42006	[their] pendants, bracelets, and veils,
c42007	[their] headdresses, ankle chains, and sashes, [their] perfume bottles and charms;
c42008	[their] signet rings and nose rings,
c42009	[their] festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses,
c42010	and [their] mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls.
c42011	there will be
c42012	Instead of fragrance ... a stench;
c42013	instead of a belt, a rope;
c42014	instead of styled hair, baldness;
c42015	instead of fine clothes, sackcloth;
c42016	instead of beauty, branding.
c42017	Your men will fall by the sword,
c42018	and your warriors in battle.
c42019	will lament
c42020	And the gates [of Zion] ... and mourn;
c42021	destitute,
c42022	she will sit on the ground.
c42023	On that day seven women will take hold of one man
c42024	and say,
c42025	“We will eat our own bread
c42026	and provide our own clothes.
c42027	Just let us be called by your name.
c42028	Take away our disgrace!”
c42029	On that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious,
c42030	and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of Israel’s survivors.
c42032	Whoever remains in Zion
c42033	and whoever is left in Jerusalem
c42034	holy—
c42035	will be called ... all
c42036	in Jerusalem who are recorded among the living—
c42037	when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion
c42038	and cleansed the bloodstains from the heart of Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit
c42039	of fire.
c42040	Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud ... by day
c42041	of smoke ... and a glowing flame of fire by night.
c42042	For over all the glory there will be a canopy,
c42043	a shelter to [give] shade from the heat by day,
c42044	and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and the rain.
c42045	I will sing for my beloved, a song of [his] vineyard:
c42046	My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
c42047	He dug it up
c42048	and cleared the stones
c42049	and planted the finest vines.
c42050	He built a watchtower in the middle
c42051	and dug out a winepress {as well}.
c42052	He waited for [the vineyard]
c42053	to yield good grapes,
c42054	but the fruit it produced was sour!
c42055	And now,
c42056	O dwellers of Jerusalem and men of Judah,
c42057	I exhort you to judge between Me and My vineyard.
c42058	What
c42059	more could have been done for My vineyard
c42060	that I did not already do in it?
c42061	Why, when I waited
c42062	for it to yield good grapes,
c42063	did it bring forth sour fruit?
c42064	Now I will tell you
c42065	what I am about to do to My vineyard:
c42066	I will take away its hedge,
c42067	and it will be
c42068	consumed;
c42069	I will tear down its wall,
c42070	and it will be trampled.
c42071	I will make it a wasteland,
c42072	neither pruned
c42073	nor cultivated,
c42074	and thorns and briers will grow up.
c42075	I will command the clouds
c42076	that rain shall not fall on it.
c42077	For the vineyard of the LORD of Hosts is the house of Israel,
c42078	and the men of Judah are the plant of His delight.
c42079	He looked for justice
c42080	but saw injustice;
c42081	for righteousness,
c42082	but heard a cry of distress.
c42083	Woe
c42084	to those who add house to house
c42085	and join field to field until there is no room
c42086	and you dwell alone in the land.
c42087	I heard the LORD of Hosts {declare}:
c42088	“Surely many houses will become desolate,
c42089	great mansions left unoccupied.
c42090	For ten acres of vineyard will yield [but] a bath [of wine],
c42091	and a homer of seed [only] an ephah [of grain].”
c42092	Woe
c42093	to those who rise early in the morning
c42094	in pursuit of strong drink,
c42095	who linger into the evening,
c42096	to be inflamed by wine.
c42097	At their feasts are the lyre [and] harp, tambourines and flutes and wine.
c42098	They disregard the actions of the LORD,
c42099	and fail to see the work of His hands.
c42100	Therefore My people will go into exile for their lack of understanding;
c42101	their dignitaries are starving,
c42102	and their masses are parched with thirst.
c42103	Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat
c42104	and opens wide its enormous jaws,
c42105	and down go [Zion’s] nobles [and] masses, her jubilant and carousers!
c42106	So mankind will be brought low,
c42107	and each man humbled;
c42108	the arrogant will lower their eyes.
c42109	But the LORD of Hosts will be exalted by His justice,
c42110	and the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness.
c42111	Lambs will graze as in their own pastures,
c42112	and strangers will feed in the ruins of the wealthy.
c42113	Woe
c42114	to those who draw iniquity with cords of deceit
c42115	and pull sin along with cart ropes,
c42116	to those who say,
c42117	“Let Him hurry
c42118	and hasten His work
c42119	so that we may see it!
c42121	Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come
c42122	so that we may know it!”
c42123	Woe
c42124	to those who call evil
c42125	good
c42126	and good
c42127	evil,
c42128	who turn darkness to light
c42129	and light to darkness,
c42130	who replace bitter with sweet
c42131	and sweet with bitter.
c42132	Woe
c42133	to those who are wise in their own eyes
c42134	and clever in their own sight.
c42135	Woe to those who are heroes
c42136	in drinking wine,
c42137	and champions
c42138	in mixing beer,
c42139	who acquit the guilty for a bribe,
c42140	and deprive the innocent of justice.
c42141	Therefore,
c42142	as a tongue of fire consumes straw
c42143	and dry grass shrivels in the flame,
c42144	so their roots will decay
c42145	and their blossoms will blow away like dust;
c42146	for they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of Hosts
c42147	and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
c42148	Therefore the LORD’s anger burns against His people;
c42149	He has raised His hand against them
c42150	and struck them;
c42151	the mountains quaked,
c42152	and their corpses lay like refuse in the streets.
c42153	Yet through all this, His anger is not spent,
c42154	and His hand is still upraised.
c42155	He lifts a banner for the distant nations
c42156	and whistles for those at the ends of the earth.
c42157	Behold— how speedily and swiftly they come!
c42158	None of them grows weary
c42159	or stumbles;
c42160	no one slumbers
c42161	or sleeps. No
c42162	belt is loose and no
c42163	sandal strap is broken.
c42164	Their arrows are sharpened,
c42165	and all their bows are strung.
c42166	The hooves of their horses are like flint;
c42167	their chariot wheels [are] like a whirlwind.
c42168	Their roaring is like that of a lion;
c42169	they roar like young lions.
c42170	They growl
c42171	and seize their prey;
c42172	they carry it
c42173	away from deliverance.
c42174	In that day they will roar over it, like the roaring of the sea.
c42175	If one looks over the land,
c42176	he will see darkness and distress;
c42177	even the light will be obscured by clouds.
c42178	In the year that King Uzziah died,
c42179	I saw the Lord
c42180	seated on a throne, high and exalted;
c42181	and the train of His robe filled the temple.
c42182	Above Him stood seraphim,
c42183	each having six wings:
c42184	With two [wings] they covered their faces,
c42185	with two they covered their feet,
c42186	and with two they were flying.
c42187	And they called out to one another:
c42189	Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts;
c42190	His glory fills all the earth.
c42191	The doorposts and thresholds shook at the sound of their voices,
c42192	and the temple was filled with smoke.
c42193	Then I said,
c42194	“Woe is me,
c42195	for I am ruined,
c42196	because I am a man of unclean lips
c42197	dwelling among a people of unclean lips,
c42198	[and] my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts.”
c42199	Then one of the seraphim flew to me,
c42200	and in his hand was a glowing coal
c42201	that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
c42202	And with it he touched my mouth
c42203	and said,
c42204	“Now that this has touched your lips,
c42205	your iniquity is removed
c42206	and your sin is atoned for.”
c42207	Then I heard the voice of the Lord
c42208	saying,
c42209	“Whom shall I send?
c42210	Who will go for Us?”
c42211	And I said,
c42212	“Here am I.
c42213	Send me!”
c42214	And He replied,
c42215	“Go
c42216	and tell this people:
c42217	‘Be ever hearing,
c42218	but never understanding;
c42219	be ever seeing,
c42220	but never perceiving.’
c42221	{Make} the hearts of this people calloused;
c42222	deafen their ears
c42223	and close their eyes.
c42224	Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
c42225	hear with their ears,
c42226	understand with their hearts,
c42227	and turn
c42228	and be healed.
c42229	Then I asked,
c42230	“How long,
c42231	O Lord?”
c42232	And He replied,
c42233	“Until cities lie in ruins
c42234	without an inhabitant,
c42235	until the houses
c42236	are left unoccupied,
c42237	and the land is desolate and ravaged,
c42238	until the LORD has driven men far away,
c42239	and the land is utterly forsaken.
c42240	And though a tenth [remains] in [the land],
c42241	again.
c42242	it will be
c42243	burned
c42244	As the terebinth and oak
c42245	leave stumps when felled, ... in [the land].”
c42246	so the holy seed will be a stump
c42247	Now in the days that Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, [was] king of Judah,
c42248	Rezin king of Aram marched up to [wage] war against Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Pekah son of Remaliah the king of Israel,
c42249	but he could not
c42250	overpower [the city].
c42251	When it became known to the house of David
c42253	that Aram was in league with Ephraim,
c42254	the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled
c42255	like trees in the forest shaken by the wind.
c42256	Then the LORD said to Isaiah,
c42257	“Go out
c42258	to meet Ahaz
c42259	with your son Shear-jashub ... at the end of the aqueduct [that feeds] the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field,
c42260	and say to him:
c42261	‘Calm down
c42262	and be quiet.
c42263	Do not be afraid
c42264	or fainthearted over these two smoldering stubs of firewood, over the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
c42265	For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted your ruin,
c42266	saying,
c42267	‘Let us invade Judah,
c42268	terrorize it,
c42269	and conquer it for ourselves.
c42270	Then we can install the son of Tabeal over it as king.’”
c42271	But this is what the Lord GOD says:
c42272	“It will not arise;
c42273	it will not happen.
c42274	For the head of Aram is Damascus,
c42275	[and] the head of Damascus is Rezin.
c42276	Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.
c42277	The head of Ephraim is Samaria,
c42278	and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.
c42279	If you do not stand firm in your faith,
c42280	then you will not stand at all.”
c42281	Again the LORD
c42282	spoke to Ahaz:
c42284	“Ask for a sign from the LORD your God,
c42285	[whether] from the depths of Sheol
c42286	or the heights of heaven.”
c42287	But Ahaz replied,
c42288	“I will not ask;
c42289	I will not test the LORD.”
c42290	Then Isaiah said,
c42291	“Hear now,
c42292	O house of David!
c42293	Is it not enough
c42294	to try the patience of men?
c42295	Will you try the patience of my God as well?
c42296	Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign:
c42297	Behold, the virgin will be with child
c42298	and will give birth to a son,
c42299	and she will call Him Immanuel.
c42300	He will be eating curds and honey.
c42301	By the time he knows [enough]
c42302	to reject evil
c42303	and choose good,
c42304	For
c42305	before the boy knows [enough]
c42306	to reject evil
c42307	and choose good,
c42308	the land ... will be laid waste.
c42309	of the two kings you dread
c42310	The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time
c42311	unlike [any since] the day
c42312	Ephraim separated from Judah—
c42313	[He will bring] the king of Assyria.”
c42314	On that day
c42315	the LORD will whistle to the flies
c42316	at the farthest streams of the Nile
c42317	and to the bees
c42318	in the land of Assyria.
c42319	come
c42320	And they will all ... and settle in the steep ravines and clefts of the rocks, in all the thornbushes and watering holes.
c42321	On that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates— the king of Assyria— to shave your head and the hair of your legs,
c42322	and to remove your beard as well.
c42323	On that day
c42324	a man will raise a young cow and two sheep,
c42325	and from the abundant
c42326	milk they give,
c42327	he will eat curds;
c42328	for all ... will eat curds and honey.
c42329	who remain in the land
c42330	And on that day, ... there used to be
c42331	in every place ... there will be only
c42332	where ... a thousand vines worth a thousand [shekels] of silver,
c42333	thorns and briers.
c42334	Men will go there with bow and arrow,
c42335	for the land will be [covered with] thorns and briers.
c42336	the hills
c42337	once tilled by the hoe;
c42338	For fear of the thorns and briers, you will no longer traverse
c42339	they will become [places] for oxen to graze and sheep to trample.
c42340	Then the LORD said to me,
c42341	“Take a large scroll
c42342	and write on it with an ordinary stylus:
c42343	Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
c42344	And I will appoint for myself trustworthy witnesses— Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
c42345	And I had relations with the prophetess,
c42346	and she conceived
c42347	and gave birth to a son.
c42348	The LORD said to me,
c42349	“Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
c42350	For
c42351	before the boy knows
c42352	how to cry ‘Father’ or ‘Mother,’
c42353	the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off to the king of Assyria.”
c42354	And the LORD ... me
c42355	spoke to ... further:
c42357	“Because this people has rejected ... waters of Shiloah
c42358	the gently flowing
c42359	and rejoiced in Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
c42360	the Lord will surely bring against them the mighty rushing waters of the Euphrates— the king of Assyria and all his pomp.
c42361	It will overflow its channels ... all
c42362	and run over ... its banks.
c42363	It will pour into Judah,
c42364	swirling
c42365	and sweeping over it,
c42366	reaching up to the neck;
c42367	its spreading streams will cover your entire land,
c42368	O Immanuel!
c42369	Huddle together,
c42370	O peoples,
c42371	and be shattered;
c42372	pay attention,
c42373	all you distant lands;
c42374	prepare for battle,
c42375	and be broken;
c42376	prepare for battle,
c42377	and be dismayed.
c42378	Devise a plan,
c42379	but it will be thwarted;
c42380	state a proposal,
c42381	but it will not happen.
c42382	For God is with us.”
c42383	For this is what the LORD spoke to me with a strong hand,
c42384	instructing me
c42385	not to walk in the way of this people:
c42387	“Do not call conspiracy everything
c42388	these people regard as conspiracy.
c42389	Do not fear what they fear;
c42390	do not live in dread.
c42391	The LORD of Hosts
c42392	is the One to regard as holy.
c42393	Only He should be feared;
c42394	only He should be dreaded,
c42395	and He will be a sanctuary.
c42396	But to both houses of Israel He will be a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense,
c42397	a trap and a snare to the dwellers of Jerusalem.
c42398	Many will stumble over these;
c42399	they will fall
c42400	and be broken;
c42401	they will be ensnared
c42402	and captured.
c42403	Bind up the testimony
c42404	[and] seal the law among my disciples.
c42405	I will wait for the LORD,
c42406	who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob.
c42407	I will put my trust in Him.
c42408	Here am I, and the children
c42409	the LORD has given me
c42410	to be signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD of Hosts,
c42411	who dwells on Mount Zion.
c42412	When men tell you
c42413	to consult the spirits of the dead and the spiritists
c42414	who whisper
c42415	and mutter,
c42416	shouldn’t a people consult their God [instead]?
c42417	Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?
c42418	To the law and to the testimony!
c42419	If they do not speak according to this word,
c42420	they have no light of dawn.
c42421	They will roam the land,
c42422	dejected
c42423	and hungry.
c42425	When they are famished,
c42426	they will become enraged,
c42427	they will curse their king and their God.
c42428	and looking upward,
c42429	Then they will look to the earth
c42430	and see only distress and darkness and the gloom of anguish.
c42431	And they will be driven into utter darkness.
c42432	Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom
c42433	for those in distress.
c42434	In the past He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
c42435	but in the future He will honor the Way to the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:
c42436	The people
c42437	walking in darkness
c42438	have seen a great light;
c42439	those living in the land of the shadow of death,
c42440	on ... a light has dawned.
c42441	You have enlarged the nation
c42442	and increased its joy.
c42443	The people rejoice before You as they rejoice at harvest time
c42444	as [men] rejoice
c42445	in dividing the plunder.
c42446	For the yoke of their burden, the bar [across] their shoulders, and the rod
c42447	of their oppressor
c42448	You have shattered as in the day of Midian.
c42449	For every trampling boot of battle
c42450	and [every] garment rolled in blood
c42451	will be burned as fuel for the fire.
c42452	For ... a child is born, unto us
c42453	unto us ... a son is given,
c42454	and the government will be upon His shoulders.
c42455	And He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
c42456	Of the increase of [His] government and peace [there will be] no end. He will reign on the throne of David and over his kingdom,
c42457	to establish
c42458	and sustain it with justice and righteousness from that time and forevermore.
c42459	The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.
c42460	The Lord has sent a message against Jacob,
c42461	and it has fallen upon Israel.
c42462	All the people will know it— Ephraim and the dwellers of Samaria. With pride and arrogance of heart
c42463	they will say:
c42464	“The bricks have fallen,
c42465	but we will rebuild with finished stone;
c42466	the sycamores have been felled,
c42467	but we will replace them with cedars.”
c42468	The LORD has raised up the foes of Rezin against him
c42469	and joined his enemies {together}.
c42470	Aram from the east
c42471	and Philistia from the west
c42472	have devoured Israel with open mouths.
c42473	Despite all this, His anger is not turned away;
c42474	His hand is still upraised.
c42475	But the people did not return
c42476	to Him who struck them;
c42477	they did not seek the LORD of Hosts.
c42478	So the LORD will cut off Israel’s head and tail, [both] palm branch and reed in a single day.
c42479	is the elder and the honorable
c42480	The head ... man
c42481	is the prophet
c42482	who teaches lies.
c42483	and the tail
c42484	For those who guide this people mislead them,
c42485	and those they mislead are swallowed up.
c42486	Therefore the Lord takes no pleasure in their young men;
c42487	He has no compassion on their fatherless and widows.
c42488	For every one of them is godless and wicked,
c42489	and every mouth speaks folly.
c42490	Despite all this, His anger is not turned away;
c42491	His hand is still upraised.
c42492	For wickedness burns like a fire
c42493	that consumes the thorns and briers
c42494	and kindles the forest thickets
c42495	which roll upward in columns of smoke.
c42496	By the wrath of the LORD of Hosts the land is scorched,
c42497	and the people are fuel for the fire.
c42498	one ... his brother.
c42499	Not ... will spare
c42500	They carve out what is on the right,
c42501	but they are still hungry;
c42502	they have eaten what is on the left,
c42503	but they are still not satisfied.
c42504	Each one ... the flesh of his own arm.
c42505	devours
c42506	Manasseh [devours] Ephraim,
c42507	and Ephraim Manasseh;
c42508	together they turn against Judah.
c42509	Despite all this, His anger is not turned away;
c42510	His hand is still upraised.
c42511	Woe
c42512	to those who enact unjust statutes
c42513	and issue oppressive
c42514	decrees,
c42515	to deprive the poor of fair treatment
c42516	and withhold justice from the oppressed of My people,
c42517	to make widows their spoil
c42518	and plunder the fatherless.
c42519	What will you do on the day of reckoning
c42520	when devastation
c42521	comes from afar?
c42522	To whom will you flee for help?
c42523	Where will you leave your wealth?
c42524	Nothing will remain but to crouch among the captives
c42525	or fall among the slain.
c42526	Despite all this, His anger is not turned away;
c42527	His hand is still upraised.
c42528	Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger;
c42529	the staff
c42530	in their hands is My wrath.
c42531	I will send him against a godless nation;
c42532	I will dispatch him against a people destined for My rage,
c42533	to take spoils
c42534	and seize plunder,
c42535	and to trample them down like clay in the streets.
c42536	But this is not what he intends;
c42537	this is not what he plans. His purpose
c42539	is to destroy
c42541	and cut off ... nations.
c42542	many
c42543	he says.
c42544	“Are not all my commanders kings?”
c42545	“Is not Calno like Carchemish?
c42546	Is not Hamath like Arpad?
c42547	Is not Samaria like Damascus?
c42548	As my hand seized the idolatrous kingdoms,
c42549	whose images [surpassed] those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
c42550	will I not
c42551	and as I have done to Samaria and its idols,
c42552	also do to Jerusalem and her idols?”
c42554	So when the Lord has completed all His work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem,
c42555	He will say, “I will punish the king of Assyria for the fruit of his arrogant heart and the proud look in his eyes.”
c42556	For he says:
c42557	“By the strength of my hand I have done [this],
c42558	and [by my] wisdom,
c42559	for I am clever.
c42560	I have removed the boundaries of nations
c42561	and plundered their treasures;
c42562	like a mighty one I subdued their rulers.
c42563	My hand reached as into a nest to seize the wealth of the nations.
c42565	Like one gathering abandoned eggs,
c42566	I gathered all the earth.
c42567	No
c42568	wing fluttered,
c42569	no beak opened
c42570	or chirped.”
c42571	Does an ax raise itself
c42572	above the one who swings it?
c42573	Does a saw boast over him who saws with it?
c42574	It would be like a staff waving
c42575	the one who lifts it!
c42576	It would be like a staff lifting
c42577	him who is not wood!
c42578	Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts will send a wasting disease among [Assyria’s] stout warriors,
c42579	and under his pomp will be kindled a fire like a burning flame.
c42580	And the Light of Israel will become a fire,
c42581	and its Holy One a flame.
c42582	it will burn
c42583	In a single day ... and devour Assyria’s thorns and thistles.
c42584	The splendor of its forests and orchards, both soul and body, it will completely destroy,
c42586	as a sickness consumes a man.
c42587	The remaining trees of its forests will be so few
c42588	that a child could count them.
c42589	On that day
c42590	the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no longer
c42591	depend on him who struck them,
c42592	but they will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
c42593	A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob, to the Mighty God.
c42594	Though
c42595	your people, O Israel, be like the sand of the sea,
c42596	only a remnant will return.
c42597	Destruction has been decreed,
c42598	overflowing with righteousness.
c42599	For the Lord GOD of Hosts will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land.
c42600	Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says:
c42601	do not fear
c42602	“O My people
c42603	who dwell in Zion,
c42604	Assyria,
c42605	who strikes you with a rod
c42606	and lifts his staff against you as the Egyptians did.
c42607	For in just a very little while
c42608	My wrath will be spent
c42609	and My anger will turn to their destruction.”
c42610	And the LORD of Hosts will brandish a whip against them, as when He struck Midian at the rock of Oreb;
c42611	His staff over the sea,
c42612	He will raise ... as He did in Egypt.
c42613	On that day
c42614	the burden will be lifted from your shoulders,
c42615	and the yoke from your neck.
c42616	The yoke will be broken because of your fatness.
c42617	[Assyria] has entered Aiath
c42618	and passed through Migron,
c42619	storing supplies at Michmash.
c42620	They have crossed at the ford:
c42621	“We will spend the night at Geba.”
c42622	Ramah trembles;
c42623	Gibeah of Saul flees.
c42624	Cry aloud,
c42625	O daughter of Gallim!
c42626	Listen,
c42627	O Laishah!
c42628	O wretched Anathoth!
c42629	Madmenah flees;
c42630	the people of Gebim take refuge.
c42631	Yet today ... at Nob,
c42632	they will halt
c42633	shaking a fist at the mount of the Daughter of Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem.
c42634	Behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts will lop off the branches with terrifying power.
c42635	The tall trees will be cut down,
c42636	the lofty ones will be felled.
c42637	He will clear the forest thickets with an ax,
c42638	and Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.
c42639	A shoot will spring up from the stump of Jesse,
c42640	and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
c42641	The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him— the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and strength, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
c42642	And He will delight in the fear of the LORD.
c42643	He will not judge by what His eyes see,
c42644	and He will not decide by what His ears hear,
c42645	but with righteousness He will judge the poor,
c42646	and with equity He will decide in favor of the earth’s oppressed.
c42647	He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth
c42648	and slay the wicked with the breath of His lips.
c42649	Righteousness will be the belt around His hips,
c42650	and faithfulness the sash around His waist.
c42651	The wolf will live with the lamb,
c42652	and the leopard will lie down with the goat;
c42653	the calf and young lion and fatling will be together,
c42654	and a little child will lead them.
c42655	The cow will graze with the bear, ... together,
c42656	their young will lie down
c42657	and the lion will eat straw like the ox.
c42658	The infant will play by the cobra’s den,
c42659	and the toddler will reach into the viper’s nest.
c42660	They will neither harm
c42661	nor destroy on all My holy mountain,
c42662	for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD
c42663	as the sea is full of water.
c42664	On that day
c42665	the root of Jesse
c42666	will stand as a banner for the peoples.
c42667	The nations will seek Him,
c42668	and His place of rest will be glorious.
c42669	On that day
c42670	the Lord will extend His hand a second time
c42671	to recover the remnant of His people
c42672	from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
c42673	He will raise a banner for the nations
c42674	and gather the exiles of Israel;
c42675	He will collect the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
c42676	Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart,
c42677	and the adversaries of Judah will be cut off.
c42678	Ephraim will no longer envy Judah,
c42679	nor will Judah harass Ephraim.
c42680	They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines to the west;
c42681	together they will plunder the people of the east.
c42682	They will lay their hands on Edom and Moab,
c42683	and the Ammonites will be subject to them.
c42684	The LORD will devote to destruction the gulf of the Egyptian Sea;
c42685	with a scorching wind He will sweep His hand over the Euphrates.
c42686	He will split it into seven streams,
c42687	for men to cross with dry sandals.
c42688	There will be a highway for the remnant of His people
c42689	who remain from Assyria,
c42690	as there was for Israel when
c42691	they came up from the land of Egypt.
c42692	In that day you will say:
c42693	I will praise You.
c42694	“O LORD,
c42695	Although You were angry with me,
c42696	Your anger has turned away,
c42697	and You have comforted me.
c42698	Surely God is my salvation;
c42699	I will trust
c42700	and not be afraid.
c42701	For the LORD GOD is my strength and my song,
c42702	and He also has become my salvation.”
c42703	With joy you will draw water from the springs of salvation,
c42704	and on that day you will say:
c42705	“Give thanks to the LORD;
c42706	proclaim His name!
c42707	Make His works {known} among the peoples;
c42708	declare
c42709	that His name is exalted.
c42710	Sing to the LORD,
c42711	for He has done glorious things.
c42712	Let this be known in all the earth.
c42713	Cry out
c42714	and sing,
c42715	O citizen of Zion,
c42716	for great among you [is] the Holy One of Israel.”
c42717	[This is] an oracle concerning Babylon
c42718	that Isaiah son of Amoz received:
c42719	Raise a banner on a barren hilltop;
c42720	call aloud to them.
c42721	Wave your hand,
c42722	that they may enter the gates of the nobles.
c42723	I have commanded My sanctified ones;
c42724	I have even summoned My warriors to execute My wrath [and] exult in My triumph.
c42725	Listen, a tumult on the mountains,
c42726	like that of a great multitude!
c42727	Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations gathered together!
c42728	The LORD of Hosts musters an army for war.
c42729	They are coming from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens— the LORD and the weapons of His wrath—
c42730	to destroy the whole country.
c42731	Wail,
c42732	for the Day of the LORD is near;
c42733	it will come as destruction from the Almighty.
c42734	Therefore all hands will fall limp,
c42735	and every man’s heart will melt.
c42736	Terror,
c42737	pain, and anguish will seize them;
c42738	they will writhe like a woman in labor.
c42739	They will look in astonishment at one another,
c42740	with fear.
c42741	their faces aflame
c42742	Behold, the Day of the LORD is coming— cruel, with fury and burning anger—
c42743	to make the earth a desolation
c42744	and to destroy the sinners within it.
c42745	For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not give their light.
c42746	The sun will be darkened
c42747	when it rises,
c42748	and the moon will not give its light.
c42749	I will punish the world [for its] evil,
c42750	and the wicked for their iniquity.
c42751	I will end the haughtiness of the arrogant
c42752	and humiliate the pride of tyrants.
c42753	{I will make} man scarcer than pure gold,
c42754	and mankind rarer than the gold of Ophir.
c42755	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble,
c42756	and the earth will be shaken from its place at the wrath of the LORD of Hosts on the day of His burning anger.
c42758	Like a hunted gazelle and like a sheep
c42759	without a shepherd,
c42760	each ... to his own people,
c42761	will return
c42763	each ... to his native land.
c42764	will flee
c42765	Whoever is caught will be stabbed,
c42766	and whoever is captured will die by the sword.
c42767	Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes,
c42768	their houses will be looted,
c42769	and their wives will be ravished.
c42770	Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes,
c42771	who have no regard for silver
c42772	for gold.
c42773	and no desire
c42774	Their bows {will dash} young men to pieces;
c42775	they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb;
c42776	they will not look with pity on the children.
c42777	And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms, the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.
c42778	She will never be inhabited
c42779	or settled from generation to generation;
c42780	no nomad will pitch his tent there,
c42781	no shepherd will rest his flock there.
c42782	But desert creatures will lie down there,
c42783	and howling creatures will fill her houses.
c42784	The owls will dwell there,
c42785	and wild goats will leap about.
c42786	Hyenas will howl in her fortresses
c42787	and jackals in her luxurious palaces.
c42788	is at hand,
c42790	Babylon’s time
c42791	and her days will not be prolonged.
c42792	For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob
c42793	and choose Israel once again.
c42794	He will settle them on their own land.
c42795	The foreigner will join them ... with
c42796	and be united ... the house of Jacob.
c42797	The nations will escort [Israel]
c42798	and bring it to its homeland.
c42799	Then the house of Israel will possess [the nations] as menservants and maidservants in the LORD’s land.
c42800	They will make captives of their captors
c42801	and rule over their oppressors.
c42802	On the day that
c42803	the LORD gives you rest from your pain and torment, and from the hard labor
c42804	into which you were forced,
c42805	you will sing this song of contempt against the king of Babylon:
c42807	How the oppressor has ceased,
c42808	and how his fury has ended!
c42809	The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers.
c42810	It struck the peoples in anger with unceasing blows;
c42811	it subdued the nations in rage ... persecution.
c42812	with relentless
c42813	and at rest;
c42814	All the earth is at peace
c42815	they break out in song.
c42816	Even the cypresses ... exult over you:
c42817	and cedars of Lebanon
c42818	“Since you have been laid low,
c42819	no woodcutter comes against us.”
c42820	Sheol beneath is eager
c42821	to meet you
c42822	upon your arrival.
c42823	It stirs the spirits of the dead to greet you— all the rulers of the earth.
c42824	It makes all the kings of the nations rise from their thrones.
c42825	They will all respond
c42826	and say to you,
c42827	“You too have become weak as
c42828	we are; you have become like us!”
c42829	Your pomp has been brought down to Sheol, with the music of your harps.
c42830	Maggots spread out beneath you,
c42831	and worms cover you.
c42832	How you have fallen from heaven,
c42833	O Morning Star, son of the dawn!
c42834	You have been cut down to the ground,
c42835	O destroyer of nations.
c42836	You said in your heart:
c42837	“I will ascend to the heavens;
c42838	I will raise my throne above the stars of God.
c42839	I will sit on the mount of assembly, in the far reaches of the north.
c42840	I will ascend above the tops of the clouds;
c42841	I will make myself like the Most High.”
c42842	But you will be brought down to Sheol to the far reaches of the Pit.
c42843	Those who see you will stare;
c42844	they will ponder your fate:
c42845	“Is this the man
c42846	who shook the earth
c42847	[and] made the kingdoms tremble,
c42848	who turned the world into a desert
c42849	and destroyed its cities,
c42850	who refused to let the captives return to their homes?”
c42851	All the kings of the nations
c42852	lie in state,
c42853	each in his own tomb.
c42854	But you are cast out of your grave like a rejected branch,
c42855	covered by those slain with the sword,
c42856	and dumped into a rocky pit, like a carcass trampled underfoot.
c42857	You will not join them in burial,
c42858	since you have destroyed your land
c42859	and slaughtered your own people.
c42860	The offspring of the wicked will never again be mentioned.
c42861	Prepare a place of slaughter for his sons for the iniquity of their fathers.
c42862	They will never rise up
c42863	to possess a land
c42864	or cover the earth with their cities.
c42865	“I will rise up against them,”
c42866	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c42867	“I will cut off from Babylon her name and her remnant, her offspring and her posterity,”
c42868	declares the LORD.
c42869	“I will make her a place for owls
c42870	and swamplands;
c42871	I will sweep her away with the broom
c42872	of destruction,”
c42873	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c42874	The LORD of Hosts has sworn:
c42877	“As I have planned,
c42878	so will it be;
c42879	as I have purposed,
c42880	[so] will it stand.
c42881	I will break Assyria in My land;
c42882	I will trample him on My mountain.
c42883	His yoke will be taken off [My people],
c42884	and his burden removed from their shoulders.”
c42885	This is the plan
c42886	devised for the whole earth,
c42887	and this is the hand
c42888	stretched out over all the nations.
c42889	The LORD of Hosts has purposed,
c42890	and who can thwart Him?
c42891	His hand is outstretched,
c42892	so who can turn it back?
c42893	In the year that King Ahaz died, this oracle was received:
c42894	Do not rejoice,
c42895	all you Philistines,
c42896	that the rod ... is broken.
c42897	that struck you
c42898	For a viper will spring from the serpent’s root,
c42899	and a flying serpent from its egg.
c42900	Then the firstborn of the poor will find pasture,
c42901	and the needy will lie down in safety,
c42902	but I will kill your root by famine,
c42903	and your remnant will be slain.
c42904	Wail,
c42905	O gate!
c42906	Cry out,
c42907	O city!
c42908	Melt away,
c42909	all you Philistines!
c42910	For a cloud of smoke comes from the north,
c42911	and there are no stragglers in its ranks.
c42912	What answer will be given to the envoys of that nation?
c42913	“The LORD has founded Zion,
c42914	where His afflicted people will find refuge.”
c42915	[This is] an oracle concerning Moab:
c42916	is ruined, ... in a night!
c42917	Ar in Moab ... destroyed
c42918	is devastated, ... in a night!
c42919	Kir in Moab ... destroyed
c42920	goes up to its temple
c42921	Dibon ... to weep at its high places.
c42922	Moab wails over Nebo, as well as over Medeba.
c42923	Every head is shaved,
c42924	every beard is cut off.
c42925	In its streets they wear sackcloth;
c42926	on the rooftops and in the public squares they all wail,
c42927	falling down weeping.
c42928	Heshbon and Elealeh cry out;
c42929	their voices are heard as far as Jahaz.
c42930	Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out;
c42931	their souls tremble within.
c42932	My heart cries out over Moab;
c42933	her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath-shelishiyah;
c42934	the slope of Luhith;
c42935	with weeping they ascend
c42936	they lament their destruction on the road to Horonaim.
c42937	The waters of Nimrim are dried up;
c42938	the grass is withered,
c42939	the foliage is gone,
c42940	and the vegetation has vanished.
c42941	So ... their wealth
c42943	and belongings
c42944	they carry ... over the Brook of the Willows.
c42945	For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab.
c42946	Their wailing reaches Eglaim;
c42947	[it is heard] in Beer-elim.
c42948	The waters of Dimon are full of blood, but
c42949	I will bring more upon Dimon—
c42950	a lion on the fugitives of Moab,
c42951	and on the remnant of the land.
c42952	Send the [tribute] lambs
c42953	to the ruler of the land,
c42954	from Sela in the desert to the mount of the Daughter of Zion.
c42955	Like fluttering birds pushed out of the nest,
c42956	so are the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon:
c42957	“Give us counsel,
c42958	render a decision.
c42959	Shelter us at noonday with shade as dark as night.
c42960	Hide the refugees;
c42961	do not betray the one who flees.
c42962	Let my fugitives stay with you; ... for Moab
c42963	be a refuge ... from the destroyer.”
c42964	When the oppressor has gone,
c42965	destruction has ceased,
c42966	and the oppressors have vanished from the land,
c42967	in loving devotion a throne will be established
c42968	in the tent of David. ... will sit on [it] in faithfulness.
c42969	A judge
c42970	seeking justice
c42971	and prompt in righteousness
c42972	We have heard of Moab’s pride,
c42973	his exceeding pride
c42974	[and] conceit, his overflowing arrogance.
c42975	But his boasting is empty.
c42976	Therefore let Moab wail; ... for Moab.
c42977	let them wail together
c42978	Mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth,
c42979	you who are utterly stricken.
c42980	For the fields of Heshbon have withered,
c42981	along with the grapevines of Sibmah.
c42982	The rulers of the nations have trampled its choicest vines
c42983	that reached as far as Jazer
c42984	and spread toward the desert.
c42985	Their shoots spread out
c42986	and reached the sea.
c42987	So I weep with Jazer for the vines of Sibmah;
c42988	I drench ... with my tears.
c42989	Heshbon and Elealeh
c42990	Triumphant shouts have fallen silent over your summer fruit and your harvest.
c42991	Joy and gladness are removed from the orchard;
c42992	no one sings ... in the vineyards.
c42993	or shouts ... No
c42994	one tramples the grapes in the winepresses;
c42995	I have put an end to the cheering.
c42996	Therefore my heart laments for Moab like a harp,
c42997	my inmost being for Kir-hareseth.
c42999	When ... appears
c43000	Moab ... on the high place, when he wearies himself
c43001	and enters his sanctuary
c43002	to pray,
c43003	it will do him no good.
c43004	This is the message
c43005	that the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab.
c43006	And now the LORD says,
c43008	“In three years, as a hired worker counts the years,
c43009	Moab’s splendor will become an object of contempt, with all her many people.
c43010	And those who are left will be few
c43012	[and] feeble.”
c43013	[This is] an oracle concerning Damascus:
c43014	“Behold, Damascus is no longer a city;
c43015	it has become a heap of ruins.
c43016	The cities of Aroer are forsaken;
c43017	they will be left to the flocks,
c43018	which will lie down
c43019	with no one to fear.
c43020	The fortress will disappear from Ephraim,
c43021	and the sovereignty from Damascus.
c43022	The remnant of Aram will be like the splendor of the Israelites,”
c43023	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c43024	“In that day
c43025	the splendor of Jacob will fade,
c43026	and the fat of his body will waste away,
c43027	as
c43028	the reaper gathers the standing grain
c43029	and harvests the ears with his arm,
c43031	as one gleans heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
c43032	Yet gleanings will remain, like an olive tree that has been beaten—
c43033	two or three berries atop the tree,
c43034	four or five on its fruitful branches,”
c43035	declares the LORD, the God of Israel.
c43036	In that day men will look to their Maker
c43037	and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
c43038	They will not look to the altars they have made with their hands
c43040	they have made with their fingers.
c43042	or to the Asherahs and incense altars
c43043	In that day their strong cities will be like ... thickets and summits,
c43044	forsaken ... abandoned to the Israelites
c43045	and to utter desolation.
c43046	For you have forgotten the God of your salvation,
c43047	and failed to remember the rock of your strength.
c43048	Therefore, though you cultivate delightful plots
c43049	and set out cuttings from exotic vines—
c43050	though on the day you plant you make them grow,
c43051	and on that morning you help your seed sprout—
c43052	yet the harvest will vanish on the day of disease and incurable pain.
c43053	Alas, the tumult of many peoples—
c43054	they rage ... seas;
c43055	like the roaring
c43056	the uproar of the nations—
c43057	they rumble like the crashing of mighty waters.
c43058	The nations rage like the rush of many waters.
c43059	He rebukes them,
c43060	and they flee far away,
c43061	driven before the wind like chaff on the hills,
c43062	like tumbleweeds before a gale.
c43063	In the evening,
c43064	there is sudden terror!
c43065	Before morning,
c43066	they are no more!
c43067	This [is] the portion of those who loot us and the lot of our plunderers.
c43068	Woe to the land of whirring wings,
c43069	along the rivers of Cush,
c43070	which sends couriers by sea,
c43071	in papyrus vessels on the waters.
c43072	Go,
c43073	swift messengers,
c43074	to a people tall and smooth-skinned,
c43075	to a people
c43076	widely feared,
c43077	to a powerful nation of strange speech,
c43078	whose land is divided by rivers.
c43079	All you people of the world and dwellers of the earth,
c43080	when a banner is raised on the mountains,
c43081	you will see it;
c43083	when a trumpet sounds,
c43084	you will hear it.
c43085	For this is what the LORD has told me:
c43086	“I will quietly
c43087	look on from My dwelling place,
c43088	like shimmering heat in the sunshine,
c43089	like a cloud of dew
c43090	in the heat of harvest.”
c43091	For before the harvest,
c43092	when the blossom is gone
c43093	and the flower becomes a ripening grape,
c43094	He will cut off the shoots with a pruning knife,
c43095	and ... and discard the branches.
c43096	remove
c43097	They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey, and to the beasts of the land.
c43098	The birds will feed on them in summer,
c43099	and all the wild animals in winter.
c43100	At that time gifts will be brought to the LORD of Hosts—
c43101	from a people tall and smooth-skinned,
c43102	from a people
c43103	widely feared,
c43104	from a powerful nation of strange speech,
c43105	whose land is divided by rivers—
c43106	to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the LORD of Hosts.
c43107	[This is] an oracle concerning Egypt:
c43108	Behold, the LORD rides on a swift cloud;
c43109	He is coming to Egypt.
c43110	The idols of Egypt will tremble before Him,
c43111	and the hearts of the Egyptians will melt within them.
c43112	“So I will incite Egyptian against Egyptian;
c43113	will fight
c43114	[brother] ... against brother,
c43115	[neighbor] against neighbor,
c43116	city against city,
c43117	[and] kingdom against kingdom.
c43118	Then the spirit of the Egyptians will be emptied out from among them,
c43119	and I will frustrate their plans,
c43120	so that they will resort to idols and spirits of the dead, to mediums and spiritists.
c43121	I will deliver the Egyptians into the hands of harsh masters,
c43122	and a fierce king will rule over them,”
c43123	declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.
c43124	The waters of the [Nile] ... and empty.
c43125	and the riverbed will be parched
c43126	will dry up,
c43127	The canals will stink;
c43128	will trickle
c43129	the streams of Egypt ... and dry up;
c43130	the reeds and rushes will wither.
c43131	The bulrushes by the Nile, by the mouth of the river,
c43132	and all the fields sown along the Nile, will wither,
c43133	blow away,
c43134	and be no [more].
c43135	Then the fishermen will mourn,
c43136	all ... will lament,
c43137	who cast hooks into the Nile
c43139	and those who spread nets on the water
c43140	will grieve.
c43141	will be dismayed,
c43142	Those who work with flax ... of fine linen
c43143	and the weavers ... will turn pale.
c43144	The workers in cloth will be dejected,
c43145	and all the wage earners will be sick at heart.
c43146	The princes of Zoan are mere fools;
c43147	Pharaoh’s wise counselors give senseless advice.
c43148	How can you say to Pharaoh,
c43149	“I am one of the wise,
c43150	a son of eastern kings”?
c43151	Where are your wise men now?
c43152	Let them tell you
c43153	and reveal
c43154	what the LORD of Hosts has planned against Egypt.
c43155	The princes of Zoan have become fools;
c43156	the princes of Memphis are deceived.
c43157	The cornerstones of her tribes have led Egypt astray.
c43158	The LORD has poured into her a spirit of confusion.
c43159	Egypt has been led astray in all she does,
c43160	as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit.
c43161	There is nothing Egypt
c43162	can do— head or tail, palm or reed.
c43163	In that day the Egyptians will become like women.
c43164	They will tremble
c43165	with fear beneath the uplifted hand of the LORD of Hosts,
c43166	when He brandishes it against them.
c43167	The land of Judah will bring terror to Egypt;
c43168	whenever
c43169	Judah is mentioned,
c43170	Egypt will tremble over what the LORD of Hosts has planned
c43171	against it.
c43172	In that day five cities in the land of Egypt
c43173	will speak the language of Canaan
c43174	and swear allegiance to the LORD of Hosts.
c43175	the City of the Sun.
c43176	One of them will be called
c43177	In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the center of the land of Egypt,
c43178	and a pillar to the LORD near her border.
c43179	It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD of Hosts in the land of Egypt.
c43180	When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors,
c43181	He will send them a savior and defender
c43182	to rescue them.
c43183	The LORD will make Himself known to Egypt,
c43184	and on that day Egypt will acknowledge the LORD.
c43185	They will worship with sacrifices and offerings;
c43186	they will make vows to the LORD
c43187	and fulfill them.
c43188	And the LORD will strike Egypt {with a plague}; He will strike them but heal them.
c43189	They will turn to the LORD,
c43190	and He will hear their prayers and
c43191	heal them.
c43192	In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria.
c43193	The Assyrians will go to Egypt,
c43194	and the Egyptians to Assyria.
c43195	The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.
c43196	In that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria—
c43197	a blessing upon the earth.
c43198	The LORD of Hosts will bless them,
c43199	saying,
c43200	“Blessed [be] Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.”
c43201	Before the year
c43202	that the chief commander, ... came to Ashdod
c43203	sent by Sargon king of Assyria,
c43204	and attacked
c43205	and captured it,
c43206	the LORD had already spoken through Isaiah son of Amoz,
c43207	saying,
c43208	“Go,
c43209	remove the sackcloth from your waist
c43210	[and] the sandals from your feet.”
c43211	And [Isaiah] did so,
c43212	walking around naked and barefoot.
c43213	Then the LORD said,
c43214	“Just as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years, as a sign and omen against Egypt and Cush,
c43215	so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old alike, naked and barefoot, with bared buttocks— to Egypt’s shame.
c43216	will be dismayed
c43217	Those who made Cush their hope and Egypt their boast ... and ashamed.
c43218	And on that day the dwellers of this coastland will say,
c43219	‘See what has happened to our source of hope,
c43220	those to whom we fled for help
c43221	and deliverance from the king of Assyria!
c43222	How then can we escape?’”
c43223	[This is] an oracle concerning the Desert by the Sea:
c43224	Like whirlwinds ... through the Negev,
c43225	sweeping
c43226	[an invader] comes from the desert, from a land of terror.
c43227	A dire vision is declared to me:
c43228	“The traitor still betrays,
c43229	and the destroyer still destroys.
c43230	Go up,
c43231	O Elam!
c43232	Lay siege,
c43233	O Media!
c43234	I will put an end to all her groaning.”
c43235	Therefore my body is filled with anguish.
c43236	Pain grips me, like the pains of a woman in labor.
c43237	I am bewildered
c43238	to hear,
c43239	I am dismayed
c43240	to see.
c43241	My heart staggers;
c43242	fear makes me tremble.
c43243	The twilight of my desire has turned to horror.
c43244	They prepare a table,
c43245	they lay out a carpet,
c43246	they eat,
c43247	they drink!
c43248	Rise up,
c43249	O princes,
c43250	oil the shields!
c43251	For this [is what] the Lord says to me:
c43252	“Go,
c43253	post a lookout
c43254	what he sees.
c43255	to report
c43256	When he sees chariots with teams of horsemen, riders on donkeys, riders on camels,
c43257	he must be alert, fully alert.”
c43258	shouted,
c43259	Then the lookout
c43260	on the watchtower;
c43261	O lord,
c43262	“Day after day, ... I stand
c43263	night after night I stay at my post.
c43264	Look, here come the riders, horsemen in pairs.”
c43265	And one answered,
c43266	saying,
c43267	“Fallen,
c43268	fallen is Babylon!
c43269	All the images of her gods lie shattered on the ground.”
c43270	O My people, crushed on the threshing floor,
c43271	what I have heard from the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel.
c43272	I tell you
c43273	[This is] an oracle concerning Dumah:
c43274	One calls to me from Seir,
c43275	“Watchman,
c43276	what is left of the night?
c43277	Watchman,
c43278	what is left of the night?”
c43279	The watchman replies,
c43280	“Morning has come,
c43281	but also the night.
c43282	If you would inquire,
c43283	then inquire!
c43284	yet again.”
c43285	Come back
c43286	[This is] an oracle concerning Arabia:
c43287	In the thickets of Arabia you must lodge,
c43288	O caravans of Dedanites.
c43289	for the thirsty,
c43290	Bring water
c43291	O dwellers of Tema,
c43292	meet the refugees with food.
c43293	For they flee from the sword, the sword that is drawn, from the bow that is bent, and from the stress of battle.
c43294	For this [is what] the Lord says to me:
c43295	“Within one year, as a hired worker would count [it],
c43296	all the glory of Kedar will be gone.
c43297	The remaining archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.”
c43298	For the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.
c43299	[This is] an oracle concerning the Valley of Vision:
c43300	What ails you now,
c43301	that you have all gone up to the rooftops,
c43302	of commotion,
c43303	O city ... O town of revelry?
c43304	Your slain did not die by the sword,
c43305	nor were they killed in battle.
c43306	All your rulers have fled together,
c43307	captured without a bow.
c43308	All your fugitives were captured together,
c43309	having fled to a distant place.
c43310	Therefore I said,
c43311	“Turn away from me,
c43312	let me weep bitterly!
c43313	Do not try
c43314	to console me over the destruction of the daughter of my people.”
c43315	For the Lord GOD of Hosts has [set] a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the Valley of Vision—
c43316	of breaking down the walls
c43317	and crying to the mountains.
c43318	Elam takes up a quiver, with chariots and horsemen,
c43319	and Kir uncovers the shield.
c43321	Your choicest valleys are full of chariots,
c43322	and horsemen are posted at the gates.
c43323	He has uncovered the defenses of Judah.
c43324	On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest.
c43325	You saw ... breaches in the walls of the City of David.
c43326	that there were many
c43327	You collected water from the lower pool.
c43328	You counted the houses of Jerusalem
c43329	and tore them down
c43330	to strengthen the wall.
c43331	You built a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the ancient pool,
c43332	but you did not look to the One who made it,
c43334	Him who planned it long ago.
c43335	or consider
c43336	On that day the Lord GOD of Hosts called for weeping and wailing, for shaven heads
c43337	and the wearing of sackcloth.
c43338	But look, there is joy and gladness,
c43339	butchering of cattle
c43340	and slaughtering of sheep,
c43341	eating of meat
c43342	and drinking of wine:
c43343	“Let us eat
c43344	and drink,
c43345	for tomorrow we die!”
c43346	The LORD of Hosts has revealed in my hearing:
c43347	this sin of yours will never be atoned for,”
c43348	“Until your dying day,
c43349	says the Lord GOD of Hosts.
c43350	Thus says the Lord GOD of Hosts:
c43351	“Go,
c43352	[say] to Shebna, the steward in charge of
c43353	the palace:
c43354	What are you doing here,
c43355	and who authorized you ... for yourself
c43356	to carve out a tomb ... here,
c43357	to chisel your tomb in the height
c43358	and cut your resting place in the rock?
c43359	Look, ... The LORD is about to shake you violently.
c43360	O mighty man!
c43361	He will take hold of you,
c43362	roll you
c43363	into a ball, and sling you into a wide land.
c43364	There you will die,
c43365	and there your glorious chariots {will remain}— a disgrace to the house of your master.
c43366	I will depose you from office,
c43367	and you will be ousted from your position.
c43368	On that day
c43369	I will summon My servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
c43370	I will clothe him with your robe
c43371	and tie your sash around him.
c43372	I will put your authority in his hand,
c43373	and he will be a father to the dwellers of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
c43374	I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David.
c43375	What he opens,
c43376	no one can shut;
c43377	what he shuts,
c43378	no one can open.
c43379	I will drive him like a peg into a firm place,
c43380	and he will be a throne of glory for the house of his father.
c43381	So they will hang on him the whole burden of his father’s house: the descendants and the offshoots— all the lesser vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar.
c43382	In that day,
c43383	declares the LORD of Hosts,
c43384	the peg ... will give way;
c43385	driven into a firm place
c43386	it will be sheared off
c43387	and fall,
c43388	and the load ... will be cut down.”
c43389	upon it
c43390	Indeed, the LORD has spoken.
c43391	[This is] an oracle concerning Tyre:
c43392	Wail,
c43393	O ships of Tarshish,
c43394	for [Tyre] is laid waste, without house
c43395	[or] harbor. ... from the land of Cyprus.
c43396	Word has reached them
c43397	Be silent,
c43398	O dwellers of the coastland,
c43399	you merchants of Sidon,
c43400	whom the seafarers
c43401	have enriched.
c43402	On the great waters came the grain of Shihor;
c43403	the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre;
c43404	she was the merchant of the nations.
c43405	Be ashamed,
c43406	O Sidon,
c43407	the stronghold of the sea, for the sea has spoken:
c43409	“I have not been in labor
c43410	or given birth. I have not
c43411	raised young men
c43412	or brought up young women.”
c43413	When the report [reaches] Egypt,
c43414	they will writhe in agony over the news of Tyre.
c43415	Cross over to Tarshish;
c43416	wail,
c43417	O inhabitants of the coastland!
c43418	Is this your jubilant city,
c43419	whose origin is from antiquity,
c43420	whose feet have taken her ... far away?
c43421	to settle
c43422	Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns,
c43423	whose traders are princes,
c43424	whose merchants are renowned on the earth?
c43425	The LORD of Hosts planned it,
c43426	to defile all its glorious beauty,
c43427	to disgrace all the renowned of the earth.
c43428	Overflow your land like the Nile,
c43429	O daughter of Tarshish;
c43430	there is no longer a harbor.
c43431	[The LORD] has stretched out His hand over the sea;
c43432	He has made kingdoms tremble.
c43433	[He] has given a command that ... of Canaan
c43434	the strongholds ... be destroyed.
c43435	He said,
c43436	no more,
c43437	“You shall rejoice
c43438	O oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon.
c43439	to Cyprus—
c43440	Get up
c43441	and cross over
c43442	even there you will find no rest.”
c43443	Look at the land ... Chaldeans—
c43444	of the ... a people
c43445	now of no account.
c43446	The Assyrians destined it for the desert creatures;
c43447	they set up their siege towers
c43448	and stripped its palaces.
c43449	They brought it to ruin.
c43450	Wail,
c43451	O ships of Tarshish,
c43452	for your harbor has been destroyed!
c43453	At that time
c43454	Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years— the span of a king’s life.
c43455	But at the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
c43456	Take up your harp,
c43457	stroll through the city,
c43458	O forgotten harlot;
c43459	make sweet
c43460	melody,
c43461	sing many
c43462	a song,
c43463	so you will be remembered.
c43464	And at the end of seventy years,
c43465	the LORD will restore Tyre.
c43466	Then she will return to hire
c43467	as a prostitute and sell herself to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
c43468	Yet her profits and wages will be set apart to the LORD;
c43469	they will not be stored
c43470	or saved,
c43471	for
c43472	will go to those who live before the LORD,
c43473	her profit
c43474	for abundant food
c43475	and fine clothes.
c43476	Behold, the LORD lays waste to the earth
c43477	and leaves it in ruins.
c43478	He will twist its surface
c43479	and scatter its inhabitants—
c43480	people and priest alike,
c43481	servant and master,
c43482	maid and mistress,
c43483	buyer and seller,
c43484	lender and borrower,
c43486	creditor and debtor.
c43487	The earth will be utterly laid waste
c43488	and thoroughly plundered,
c43489	for the LORD has spoken this word.
c43490	mourns
c43491	The earth ... and withers;
c43492	languishes
c43493	the world ... and fades;
c43494	the exalted of the earth waste away.
c43495	The earth is defiled by its people;
c43496	they have transgressed the laws;
c43497	they have overstepped the decrees
c43498	and broken the everlasting covenant.
c43499	Therefore a curse has consumed the earth,
c43500	must bear the guilt;
c43501	and its inhabitants
c43502	the earth’s dwellers have been burned,
c43503	and only a few survive.
c43504	The new wine dries up;
c43505	the vine withers.
c43506	All the merrymakers now groan.
c43507	The joyful tambourines have ceased;
c43508	the noise of revelers has stopped;
c43509	the joyful harp is silent.
c43510	They no longer sing and drink wine;
c43511	strong drink is bitter to those who consume it.
c43512	The city of chaos is shattered;
c43513	every house is closed
c43514	to entry.
c43515	In the streets they cry out for wine.
c43516	All joy turns to gloom;
c43517	rejoicing is exiled from the land.
c43518	The city is left in ruins; ... to rubble.
c43519	its gate is reduced
c43520	So will it be on the earth [and] among the nations:
c43521	like a harvested olive tree, like a gleaning
c43522	after a grape harvest.
c43523	They raise their voices,
c43524	they shout for joy;
c43525	from the west they proclaim the majesty of the LORD.
c43526	Therefore glorify the LORD in the east.
c43527	Extol the name of the LORD, the God of Israel in the islands of the sea.
c43528	From the ends of the earth we hear singing: “Glory to the Righteous One.”
c43529	But I said,
c43530	“I am wasting away!
c43531	I am wasting away!
c43532	Woe is me.”
c43533	The treacherous betray;
c43534	the treacherous deal in treachery.
c43535	Terror and pit and snare await you,
c43536	O dwellers of the earth.
c43538	Whoever flees the sound of terror
c43539	will fall into a pit,
c43541	and whoever escapes from the pit
c43542	will be caught in a trap.
c43543	For the windows of heaven are open,
c43544	and the foundations of the earth are shaken.
c43545	is utterly
c43546	The earth ... broken apart,
c43547	the earth is split open,
c43548	the earth is shaken violently.
c43549	The earth staggers like a drunkard
c43550	and sways like a shack.
c43551	Earth’s rebellion weighs it down,
c43552	and it falls,
c43553	never ... again.
c43554	to rise
c43555	In that day
c43556	the LORD will punish the host of heaven above ... below.
c43557	and the kings of the earth
c43558	They will be gathered together like prisoners in a pit.
c43559	They will be confined to a dungeon
c43560	and punished after many days.
c43561	The moon will be confounded
c43562	and the sun ashamed;
c43563	for the LORD of Hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
c43564	and in the presence of His elders, He will display His glory.
c43565	O LORD,
c43566	You are my God.
c43567	I will exalt You;
c43568	I will praise Your name.
c43569	For You have worked wonders— plans formed long ago
c43570	in perfect faithfulness.
c43571	Indeed, You have turned the city into a heap of rubble, a fortified town
c43572	into ruins; the fortress of strangers [is] a city [no more];
c43573	it will never be rebuilt.
c43574	Therefore, a strong people will honor You.
c43575	The cities of ruthless nations will revere You.
c43576	For You have been a refuge for the poor,
c43577	a stronghold for the needy in distress,
c43578	a refuge from the storm,
c43579	a shade from the heat.
c43580	For the breath of the ruthless is like rain against a wall,
c43581	like heat in a dry land. ... the uproar of foreigners.
c43582	You subdue ... As the shade of a cloud cools the heat of the day,
c43583	so the song of the ruthless is silenced.
c43584	On this mountain the LORD of Hosts will prepare a banquet for all the peoples, a feast of aged wine, of choice meat, of finely aged wine.
c43585	On this mountain He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds all the peoples, the sheet
c43586	that covers all the nations;
c43587	He will swallow up death forever.
c43588	The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face
c43589	and remove the disgrace of His people from the whole earth.
c43590	For the LORD has spoken.
c43591	And in that day it will be said,
c43592	“Surely this is our God;
c43593	we have waited for Him,
c43594	and He has saved us.
c43595	This is the LORD
c43596	for whom we have waited.
c43597	Let us rejoice
c43598	and be glad in His salvation.”
c43599	For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain.
c43600	But Moab will be trampled in his place
c43601	as straw is trodden into the dung pile.
c43602	He will spread out his hands within it,
c43603	as a swimmer spreads [his hands]
c43604	to swim.
c43605	His pride will be brought low, despite the cleverness of his hands.
c43606	The high-walled fortress will be brought down,
c43608	cast to the ground, into the dust.
c43609	In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
c43610	We have a strong city.
c43611	Salvation is established as its walls and ramparts.
c43612	Open the gates
c43613	that a righteous nation may enter—
c43614	one that remains faithful.
c43615	The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace,
c43616	because he trusts in You.
c43617	Trust in the LORD forever,
c43618	because GOD the LORD [is] the Rock eternal.
c43619	For He has humbled those who dwell on high—
c43620	the lofty city {low}.
c43621	He lays
c43622	He brings it down to the ground;
c43623	He casts it into the dust.
c43624	Feet trample it down— the feet of the oppressed, the steps of the poor.
c43625	The path of the righteous is level;
c43626	You clear a straight path for the righteous.
c43627	Yes, ... [we walk] in the path of Your judgments.
c43628	O LORD;
c43629	we wait for You,
c43630	Your name and renown are the desire of [our] souls.
c43631	My soul
c43632	longs [for You] in the night;
c43633	indeed, my spirit within me
c43634	diligently seeks You.
c43635	For
c43636	when Your judgments [come] upon the earth,
c43637	the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
c43638	Though grace is shown to the wicked man,
c43639	he does not learn righteousness.
c43640	In the land of righteousness he acts unjustly
c43641	and fails to see the majesty of the LORD.
c43642	O LORD,
c43643	Your hand is upraised,
c43644	but they do not see it.
c43645	They will see
c43646	Your zeal for Your people, and be put to shame.
c43647	The fire set for Your enemies will consume them!
c43648	O LORD,
c43649	You will establish peace for us,
c43650	for, indeed, all that we have accomplished, You have done for us.
c43651	O LORD our God,
c43652	[other] lords besides You have had dominion,
c43653	but Your name alone do we confess.
c43654	The dead will not live;
c43655	the departed spirits will not rise.
c43656	Therefore You have punished
c43657	and destroyed them;
c43658	You have wiped out all memory of them.
c43659	You have enlarged the nation,
c43660	O LORD;
c43661	You have increased the nation.
c43662	You are glorified.
c43663	You have extended the borders of the land.
c43664	O LORD,
c43665	they sought You in their distress;
c43666	they poured out a quiet prayer.
c43667	when You disciplined them,
c43668	As a woman with child [and] about
c43669	to give birth
c43670	writhes
c43671	and cries out in pain,
c43672	that is how we were in Your presence,
c43673	O LORD.
c43674	We were pregnant,
c43675	we writhed in pain,
c43676	we gave birth to wind.
c43677	We have brought no salvation to the earth,
c43678	nor brought any life into the world.
c43679	Your dead will live; their bodies
c43680	will rise.
c43681	Awake
c43682	and sing,
c43683	you who dwell in the dust!
c43684	For your dew is like the dew of the morning,
c43685	and the earth will bring forth her dead.
c43686	Go,
c43687	my people,
c43688	enter your rooms
c43689	and shut your doors behind you.
c43690	Hide yourselves a little while
c43691	until the wrath has passed.
c43692	For behold, the LORD is coming out of His dwelling
c43693	to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.
c43694	The earth will reveal her bloodshed
c43695	and no longer conceal her slain.
c43696	In that day the LORD [will take] His sharp, great, and mighty sword, and bring judgment on Leviathan, the fleeing serpent— Leviathan, the coiling serpent—
c43697	and He will slay the dragon
c43698	of the sea.
c43699	In that day: ... about a fruitful vineyard.
c43700	“Sing
c43701	I, the LORD, am its keeper;
c43702	I water it continually.
c43703	so no one can disturb it.
c43704	I guard it night and day
c43705	I am not angry.
c43706	If only thorns and briers confronted Me,
c43707	I would march and trample them,
c43708	I would burn them to the ground.
c43709	Or let them lay claim to My protection;
c43710	let them make peace with Me—
c43711	[yes,] let them make peace with Me.”
c43712	In the days to come,
c43713	Jacob will take root.
c43714	and blossom
c43715	Israel will bud
c43716	and fill the whole world with fruit.
c43717	Has the LORD struck Israel as He struck her oppressors?
c43718	Was she killed like those who slayed her?
c43719	By warfare
c43720	and exile
c43721	You contended with her
c43722	and removed her with a fierce wind like the day of the east wind.
c43723	Therefore Jacob’s guilt will be atoned for,
c43724	and the fruit ... will be this: ... all
c43725	of the removal of his sin
c43726	When he makes ... the altar stones like crushed bits of chalk,
c43727	no Asherah poles or incense altars will remain standing.
c43728	For the fortified city will be deserted,
c43729	a homestead abandoned and forsaken like a wilderness.
c43730	There the calves will graze,
c43731	and there they will lie down
c43732	and strip its branches {bare}.
c43733	When its limbs are dry,
c43734	they will be broken off.
c43735	Women will come
c43736	and use them for kindling,
c43737	for they are a people without understanding.
c43738	Therefore their Maker will have no compassion on them,
c43739	and their Creator will show them no grace.
c43740	In that day
c43741	the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt,
c43742	and you, ... will be gathered one by one.
c43743	O Israelites,
c43744	And in that day
c43745	a great trumpet will sound,
c43746	will come forth
c43747	and those who were perishing in Assyria
c43748	with those who were exiles in Egypt.
c43749	And they will worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
c43750	Woe to the majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards,
c43751	to the fading flower of his glorious splendor,
c43752	set on the summit above the fertile valley,
c43753	[the pride] of those overcome by wine.
c43754	Behold, the Lord has a strong and mighty one.
c43755	Like a hailstorm or destructive tempest, like a driving rain or flooding downpour, He will smash it to the ground.
c43756	The majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards will be trampled underfoot.
c43757	The fading flower of his beautiful splendor, ... will be
c43758	on the summit above the fertile valley,
c43759	like a ripe fig before the summer harvest:
c43760	Whoever sees
c43761	while it is still in his hand.
c43762	it will swallow it
c43763	On that day the LORD of Hosts will be a crown of glory, a diadem of splendor to the remnant of His people,
c43764	a spirit of justice
c43765	to him who sits in judgment,
c43766	and a strength
c43767	to those who repel the onslaught at the gate.
c43768	These also stagger from wine
c43769	and stumble from strong drink:
c43770	Priests and prophets reel from strong drink
c43771	and are befuddled by wine.
c43772	They stumble because of strong drink,
c43773	muddled in their visions
c43774	and stumbling in their judgments.
c43775	For all their tables are covered with vomit; there is not a place without filth.
c43776	Who is it He is trying to teach?
c43777	To whom is He explaining His message?
c43778	To infants just weaned from milk?
c43779	To babies removed from the breast?
c43780	For [He says], “Order on order,
c43781	order on order,
c43782	line on line,
c43783	line on line,
c43784	a little here,
c43785	a little there.”
c43786	So with stammering speech and a foreign tongue, He will speak to this people
c43787	to whom He has said:
c43788	“This is the place of rest,
c43789	let the weary rest;
c43790	this is the place of repose.”
c43791	But they would not
c43792	listen.
c43793	Then the word of the LORD will come to them:
c43794	“Order on order,
c43795	order on order,
c43796	line on line,
c43797	line on line,
c43798	a little here,
c43799	a little there,”
c43800	so that they will go
c43801	stumbling backward
c43802	and be injured,
c43803	snared,
c43804	and captured.
c43805	Therefore hear the word of the LORD,
c43806	O scoffers,
c43807	who rule this people
c43808	in Jerusalem.
c43809	For you said,
c43810	“We have made a covenant with death;
c43811	we have fashioned an agreement with Sheol.
c43812	the overwhelming scourge
c43813	When ... passes through,
c43814	it will not touch us,
c43815	because we have made lies our refuge
c43816	and falsehood our hiding place.”
c43817	So this is what the Lord GOD says:
c43818	“See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation;
c43819	the one who believes
c43820	will never be shaken.
c43821	I will make justice the measuring line
c43822	and righteousness the level.”
c43823	Hail will sweep away your refuge of lies,
c43824	and water will flood your hiding place.
c43825	Your covenant with death will be dissolved,
c43826	and your agreement with Sheol will not stand.
c43827	the overwhelming scourge
c43828	When ... passes through,
c43829	you will be trampled by it.
c43830	As often as it passes through,
c43831	it will carry you away;
c43832	it will sweep through morning after morning, by day and by night.
c43833	Sheer terror [will come]
c43834	from understanding the message.
c43835	Indeed, the bed is too short
c43836	to stretch out on,
c43837	and the blanket too small
c43838	to wrap around you.
c43839	For the LORD will rise up as at Mount Perazim.
c43840	He will rouse Himself as [in] the valley of Gibeon,
c43841	to do His work,
c43842	His strange work,
c43843	and to perform His task,
c43844	His disturbing task.
c43845	So now, do not mock,
c43846	or your shackles will become heavier.
c43847	Indeed, I have heard from the Lord GOD of Hosts a decree of destruction against the whole land.
c43848	Listen
c43849	and hear my voice.
c43850	Pay attention
c43851	and hear what I say.
c43852	Does the plowman plow ... every day?
c43853	for planting
c43854	Does he continuously loosen
c43855	and harrow the soil?
c43856	does he not
c43857	When he has leveled its surface,
c43858	caraway and scatter
c43859	sow ... cumin?
c43860	He plants wheat in rows
c43861	and barley in plots,
c43862	with rye within its border.
c43863	instructs ... him properly.
c43864	For his God ... and teaches
c43865	Surely caraway is not threshed with a sledge,
c43866	and the wheel of a cart is not rolled over the cumin.
c43867	But caraway is beaten out with a stick,
c43868	and cumin with a rod.
c43869	Grain for bread must be ground,
c43870	but it is not endlessly threshed.
c43871	Though the wheels of the cart roll over it, the horses
c43872	do not crush it.
c43873	This also comes from the LORD of Hosts,
c43874	[who] is wonderful in counsel
c43875	[and] excellent wisdom.
c43876	Woe to you, O Ariel, Ariel, the city
c43877	where David camped!
c43878	Year upon year
c43879	let your festivals recur.
c43880	And I will constrain Ariel,
c43881	and there will be mourning and sorrow;
c43882	she will be like an altar hearth before me.
c43883	I will camp in a circle around you;
c43884	I will besiege you with towers
c43885	and set up siege works against you.
c43886	You will be brought low,
c43887	you will speak from the ground,
c43888	and out of the dust your words will be muffled.
c43889	Your voice will be like a spirit from the ground;
c43890	your speech will whisper out of the dust.
c43891	But your many foes will be like fine dust,
c43892	the multitude of the ruthless like blowing chaff.
c43893	Then suddenly, in an instant,
c43894	you will be visited by the LORD of Hosts with thunder and earthquake and loud noise, with windstorm and tempest and flame of consuming fire.
c43895	All the many nations ... will be like a dream, like a vision in the night,
c43896	going out to battle against Ariel—
c43897	even all who war against her, laying siege
c43898	and attacking her—
c43900	as when a hungry man dreams
c43901	he is eating,
c43902	then wakes
c43903	and is still hungry.
c43904	And like a thirsty man dreams
c43905	he is drinking,
c43906	then awakens
c43907	faint
c43908	and parched,
c43909	so it will be for all the many nations
c43910	who go to battle against Mount Zion.
c43911	Stop
c43912	and be astonished;
c43913	blind yourselves
c43914	and be sightless;
c43915	be drunk,
c43916	but not with wine;
c43917	stagger,
c43918	but not from strong drink.
c43919	For the LORD has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep;
c43920	He has shut your eyes, O prophets,
c43921	and covered your heads, O seers.
c43922	And the entire vision will be to you like the words sealed in a scroll.
c43923	If it is handed to a reader,
c43926	he will say,
c43927	“I cannot [read it],
c43928	because it is sealed.”
c43929	Or if the scroll is given
c43930	to one who is not able to read,
c43933	he will say,
c43934	“I cannot read.”
c43935	the Lord said:
c43936	Therefore ... “These people draw near to Me with their mouths
c43937	and honor Me with their lips,
c43938	but their hearts are far from Me.
c43939	Their worship of Me is but rules taught by men.
c43940	Therefore I will again
c43941	confound these people with wonder upon wonder.
c43942	The wisdom of the wise will perish,
c43943	and the intelligence of the intelligent will be hidden.
c43944	Woe
c43945	to those who dig deep ... from the LORD.
c43946	to hide their plans
c43947	In darkness they do their works
c43948	and say,
c43949	“Who sees us,
c43950	and who will know?”
c43951	You have turned things upside down,
c43952	as if the potter were regarded as clay.
c43953	Shall what is formed say to him who formed it,
c43954	“He did not make me”?
c43955	Can the pottery say of the potter,
c43956	“He has no understanding”?
c43957	In just a very short time,
c43958	[will not] Lebanon become an orchard,
c43959	and the orchard seem like a forest?
c43960	On that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll,
c43961	and out of the deep darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
c43962	The humble will increase [their] joy in the LORD,
c43963	and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
c43964	For the ruthless will vanish,
c43965	the mockers will disappear,
c43966	and all who look for evil will be cut down—
c43967	those who indict a man with a word,
c43968	who ensnare the mediator at the gate,
c43969	and with empty charges deprive the righteous of justice.
c43970	Therefore, the LORD ... says of the house of Jacob:
c43971	who redeemed Abraham
c43972	“No longer will Jacob be ashamed
c43973	and no more will his face grow pale.
c43974	For
c43975	when he sees his children, the work of My hands among him,
c43976	they will honor My name,
c43977	they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,
c43978	and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
c43979	Then the wayward in spirit will come to understanding,
c43980	and those who grumble will accept instruction.”
c43981	Woe ... children,
c43982	to the rebellious
c43983	declares the LORD,
c43984	to those who carry out a plan,
c43985	but not Mine,
c43986	who form an alliance,
c43987	but against My will,
c43988	heaping up sin upon sin.
c43989	They set out
c43990	to go down to Egypt
c43991	without asking My advice,
c43992	to seek shelter under Pharaoh’s protection
c43993	and take refuge in the shade of Egypt.
c43994	But Pharaoh’s protection will become your shame,
c43995	and the refuge of Egypt’s shadow your disgrace.
c43996	For though their princes are at Zoan
c43997	and their envoys have arrived in Hanes,
c43998	everyone will be put to shame because of a people
c43999	useless to them.
c44000	They cannot be of help;
c44001	for nothing
c44002	they are good
c44003	but shame
c44004	and reproach.
c44005	[This is] an oracle concerning the animals of the Negev:
c44006	Through a land of hardship and distress,
c44007	of lioness and lion,
c44008	of viper and flying serpent,
c44009	they carry their wealth on the backs of donkeys
c44010	and their treasures on the humps of camels,
c44011	to a people
c44012	of no profit to them.
c44013	Egypt’s help is vain and empty;
c44014	therefore I have called her,
c44015	‘Rahab
c44016	Who Just Sits Still.’
c44017	Go now,
c44018	write it on a tablet in their presence
c44019	and inscribe it on a scroll;
c44020	it will be for the days to come, a witness forever and ever.
c44021	These are a rebellious people,
c44022	deceitful children,
c44023	children
c44024	unwilling
c44025	to obey the LORD’s instruction.
c44026	They say ... visions,”
c44027	to the seers, “No more
c44028	and to the prophets,
c44029	“Do not prophesy to us the truth.
c44030	Speak to us pleasant words;
c44031	prophesy illusions.
c44032	Get out of the way;
c44033	leave the pathway.
c44034	Rid us of the Holy One of Israel.”
c44035	Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says:
c44036	“Because you have rejected this message,
c44037	trusting in oppression, ... on deceit,
c44038	and relying
c44039	this iniquity of yours is like a breach about to fall,
c44040	a bulge in a high wall,
c44041	whose collapse will come suddenly— in an instant!
c44042	It will break in pieces like a potter’s jar,
c44043	shattered
c44044	so that no fragment
c44045	can be found. Not a shard will be found in the dust
c44046	large enough to scoop the coals from a hearth
c44047	or to skim the water from a cistern.”
c44048	For the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said:
c44049	“By repentance and rest you would be saved;
c44050	your strength would lie in quiet confidence—
c44051	but you were not willing.”
c44052	you say,
c44053	“No,”
c44054	“we will flee on horses.”
c44055	Therefore you will flee!
c44057	“We will ride swift horses,”
c44058	but your pursuers will be faster.
c44059	A thousand will take flight at the threat of one,
c44060	at the threat of five you will flee,
c44061	until you are left alone like a lone pole on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill.
c44062	Therefore the LORD longs
c44063	to be gracious to you;
c44064	therefore He rises
c44065	to show you compassion,
c44066	for the LORD is a just God.
c44067	Blessed are all
c44068	who wait for Him.
c44070	O people in Zion,
c44071	who dwell in Jerusalem,
c44072	you will weep no more.
c44073	He will surely be gracious at the sound
c44074	of your cry;
c44075	when He hears,
c44076	He will answer you.
c44077	The Lord will give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction,
c44078	but your Teacher will no longer hide Himself—
c44079	with your own eyes you will see [Him].
c44080	your ears will hear this command behind you:
c44082	“This is the way.
c44083	Walk in it.”
c44084	And whether you turn to the right
c44085	or to the left,
c44086	So you will desecrate your silver-plated idols and your gold-plated images.
c44087	You will throw them away like menstrual cloths,
c44088	“Be gone!”
c44089	saying,
c44090	Then He will send rain for the seed
c44091	that you have sown in the ground,
c44092	and the food that comes from your land
c44093	will be rich and plentiful.
c44094	On that day your cattle will graze in open pastures.
c44095	The oxen and donkeys
c44096	that work the ground
c44097	will eat salted fodder
c44098	that has been winnowed with the shovel and pitchfork.
c44099	And from every high mountain and every raised hill, streams of water will flow in the day of great slaughter,
c44100	when the towers fall.
c44101	The light of the moon will be as bright as the sun,
c44102	and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter— like the light of seven days— on the day
c44103	that the LORD binds up the brokenness of His people
c44104	and heals the wounds He inflicted.
c44105	Behold, the Name of the LORD comes from afar,
c44106	with burning anger
c44107	and dense smoke.
c44108	His lips are full of fury,
c44109	and His tongue is like a consuming fire.
c44110	His breath is like a rushing torrent
c44111	that rises to the neck.
c44112	He comes to sift the nations in a sieve of destruction;
c44113	He bridles the jaws of the peoples to lead them astray.
c44114	You will sing as on the night
c44115	of a holy festival,
c44116	and your heart will rejoice
c44117	like one who walks to the music of a flute,
c44118	going up to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
c44119	And the LORD [will cause] His majestic voice to be heard
c44120	and His mighty arm revealed, striking in angry wrath, with a flame of consuming fire, and with cloudburst, storm, and hailstones.
c44121	For Assyria will be shattered at the voice of the LORD.
c44122	He will strike with a rod.
c44123	And with every stroke of the appointed staff
c44124	that the LORD brings down,
c44125	the tambourines and lyres [will sound] as He battles with weapons brandished.
c44126	For Topheth has long been prepared;
c44127	it has been made ready for the king.
c44128	is deep
c44129	and wide,
c44130	Its funeral pyre ... with plenty of fire and wood.
c44131	The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of brimstone, sets it ablaze.
c44132	Woe
c44133	to those who go down to Egypt for help,
c44134	who rely on horses,
c44135	who trust in ... of chariots
c44136	their abundance
c44137	and in ... of horsemen.
c44138	their multitude
c44139	They do not look to the Holy One of Israel;
c44140	they do not seek the LORD.
c44141	Yet He too [is] wise
c44142	and brings disaster;
c44143	He does not call back His words.
c44144	He will rise up against the house of the wicked and against the allies of evildoers.
c44145	But the Egyptians are men,
c44146	not God;
c44147	their horses are flesh,
c44148	not spirit.
c44149	When the LORD stretches out His hand,
c44150	the helper will stumble
c44151	and the one he helps will fall;
c44152	both will perish together.
c44153	For this is what the LORD has said to me:
c44154	“Like a lion roaring or a young lion over its prey—
c44155	and though a band of shepherds is called out against it,
c44156	it is not terrified by their shouting
c44157	or subdued by their clamor—
c44158	so the LORD of Hosts will come down
c44159	to do battle
c44160	on Mount Zion [and] its heights.
c44161	Like birds hovering overhead,
c44162	so the LORD of Hosts will protect Jerusalem.
c44163	He will shield it
c44164	and deliver it;
c44165	He will pass over it
c44166	and preserve it.”
c44167	Return
c44168	to Him against whom you have so blatantly rebelled,
c44169	O children of Israel.
c44170	For on that day, every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold
c44171	that your own hands have sinfully made.
c44172	“Then Assyria will fall, ... by the sword
c44173	but not ... of man;
c44174	a sword
c44175	but not one made by mortals.
c44176	will devour them,
c44177	They will flee before the sword,
c44178	and their young men will be put to forced labor.
c44179	Their rock will pass away for fear,
c44180	and their princes will panic at the sight of the battle standard,”
c44181	declares the LORD,
c44182	whose fire is in Zion,
c44183	whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
c44184	Behold, a king will reign in righteousness,
c44185	and princes
c44186	will rule with justice.
c44187	Each will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the storm,
c44188	like streams of water in a dry land, and the shadow of a great rock in an arid land.
c44189	Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed,
c44190	and the ears of those who hear will listen.
c44191	The mind of the rash will know and understand,
c44192	and the stammering tongue ... and fluently.
c44193	will speak clearly
c44194	No longer {will} a fool be called
c44195	noble,
c44196	nor a scoundrel said
c44197	to be important.
c44198	For a fool speaks foolishness;
c44199	his mind plots iniquity.
c44200	He practices ungodliness
c44201	and speaks falsely about the LORD;
c44202	he leaves the hungry empty
c44203	and deprives the thirsty of drink.
c44204	of the scoundrel
c44205	The weapons ... are destructive;
c44206	he hatches plots
c44207	to destroy the poor with lies,
c44208	even when the plea of the needy is just.
c44209	But a noble man makes honorable plans;
c44210	he stands up for worthy causes.
c44211	you complacent women;
c44212	Stand up,
c44213	listen to me.
c44214	you overconfident daughters.
c44215	Give ear to my word,
c44216	In a little more than a year you will tremble,
c44217	O secure ones.
c44218	For the vintage will fail
c44219	and the harvest
c44220	will not come.
c44221	Shudder,
c44222	you ladies of leisure;
c44223	tremble,
c44224	you daughters of complacency.
c44225	Strip
c44226	yourselves bare
c44227	and put sackcloth around your waists.
c44228	Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines,
c44229	and for the land of my people,
c44230	overgrown with thorns and briers—
c44231	even for every house of merriment in this city of revelry.
c44232	For the palace will be forsaken,
c44233	the busy city abandoned.
c44234	The hill and the watchtower will become caves forever—
c44235	the delight of wild donkeys
c44236	and a pasture for flocks—
c44237	until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high.
c44238	Then the desert will be an orchard,
c44239	and the orchard will seem like a forest.
c44240	Then justice will inhabit the wilderness,
c44241	and righteousness will dwell in the fertile field.
c44242	The work of righteousness will be peace;
c44243	the service of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever.
c44244	Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place, in safe and secure places of rest.
c44245	But hail
c44246	will level the forest,
c44247	and the city will sink to the depths.
c44248	Blessed
c44249	[are] those who sow beside abundant waters,
c44250	who let the ox and donkey range freely.
c44251	Woe
c44252	O destroyer
c44253	to you, ... never destroyed,
c44255	O traitor
c44256	never betrayed!
c44257	When you have finished destroying,
c44258	you will be destroyed.
c44259	When you have finished
c44260	betraying,
c44261	you will be betrayed.
c44262	O LORD,
c44263	be gracious to us!
c44264	We wait for You.
c44265	Be our strength every morning
c44266	and our salvation in time of trouble.
c44267	The peoples flee the thunder of Your voice;
c44268	the nations scatter when You rise.
c44269	Your spoil will be gathered as if by locusts;
c44270	like a swarm of locusts men will pounce on it.
c44271	The LORD is exalted,
c44272	for He dwells on high;
c44273	He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
c44274	There will be times of security for you—
c44275	a storehouse of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge.
c44276	The fear of the LORD
c44277	is Zion’s treasure.
c44278	Behold! Their warriors cry aloud in the streets;
c44279	the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
c44280	The highways are deserted;
c44281	travel has ceased.
c44282	The treaty has been broken,
c44283	the witnesses are despised,
c44284	and human life is disregarded.
c44285	mourns
c44286	The land ... [and] languishes;
c44287	Lebanon is ashamed
c44288	and decayed.
c44289	Sharon is like a desert;
c44290	Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.
c44291	“Now I will arise,”
c44292	says the LORD.
c44293	“Now I will lift Myself up.
c44294	Now I will be exalted.
c44295	You conceive chaff;
c44296	you give birth to stubble.
c44297	Your breath is a fire
c44298	that will consume you.
c44299	The peoples will be burned to ashes,
c44300	like thorns cut down
c44301	and set ablaze.
c44302	hear
c44303	You who are far off,
c44304	what I have done;
c44305	acknowledge
c44306	you who are near,
c44307	My might.”
c44308	The sinners in Zion are afraid;
c44309	trembling grips the ungodly:
c44310	“Who of us can dwell with a consuming fire?
c44311	Who of us can dwell with everlasting flames?”
c44312	He who walks righteously
c44313	and speaks with sincerity,
c44314	who refuses gain from extortion,
c44315	whose hand never
c44316	takes a bribe,
c44317	who stops his ears
c44318	against murderous plots
c44319	and shuts his eyes tightly
c44320	against evil—
c44321	he will dwell on the heights;
c44322	his refuge will be the mountain fortress;
c44323	his food will be provided
c44324	[and] his water assured.
c44325	Your eyes will see the King in His beauty
c44326	and behold a land that stretches afar.
c44327	Your mind will ponder the former terror:
c44328	“Where is he who tallies?
c44329	Where is he who weighs?
c44330	Where
c44331	is he who counts the towers?”
c44332	You will no longer see the insolent, a people
c44333	whose speech is unintelligible,
c44335	who stammer in a language
c44336	that is not understood.
c44337	Look upon Zion, the city of our festivals.
c44338	Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful pasture, a tent
c44339	that does not wander;
c44340	its tent pegs will not be pulled up,
c44341	nor will any of its cords be loosened.
c44342	But there the Majestic One, our LORD, [will be] for us
c44343	a place of rivers and wide canals,
c44344	where no galley with oars will go,
c44345	and majestic vessels will not pass.
c44346	For the LORD is our Judge,
c44347	the LORD is our lawgiver,
c44348	the LORD is our King.
c44349	He will save us.
c44350	Your ropes are slack;
c44351	they cannot secure the mast
c44352	or spread the sail.
c44353	Then ... of spoils will be divided,
c44354	an abundance
c44355	[and even] the lame will carry off plunder.
c44356	And no resident [of Zion] will say,
c44357	“I am sick.”
c44358	The people
c44359	who dwell there
c44360	will be forgiven their iniquity.
c44361	Come near,
c44362	O nations,
c44363	to listen;
c44365	O peoples.
c44366	pay attention,
c44367	Let the earth hear, and all that fills it,
c44368	the world and all that springs from it.
c44369	The LORD is angry with all the nations
c44370	and furious with all their armies.
c44371	He will set them apart for destruction;
c44372	He will give them over to slaughter.
c44373	Their slain will be left unburied,
c44374	of their corpses
c44375	and the stench ... will rise;
c44376	the mountains will flow with their blood.
c44377	All the stars of heaven will be dissolved.
c44378	The skies will be rolled up like a scroll,
c44379	and all their stars will fall
c44380	like withered leaves on the vine,
c44381	and foliage on the fig tree.
c44382	When My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens,
c44383	then it will come down upon Edom,
c44384	on the people I have set apart for destruction.
c44385	The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood.
c44386	It drips with fat— with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams.
c44387	For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah,
c44388	a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
c44389	And the wild oxen will fall with them,
c44390	the young bulls with the strong [ones].
c44391	Their land will be drenched with blood,
c44392	and their soil will be soaked with fat.
c44393	For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a time of retribution for [Edom’s] hostility against Zion.
c44394	Her streams will be turned to tar,
c44395	and her soil to sulfur;
c44396	her land will become a blazing pitch.
c44397	It will not be quenched— day or night.
c44398	Its smoke will ascend forever.
c44399	From generation to generation it will lie desolate;
c44400	no one will ever pass through it [again].
c44401	The desert owl and screech owl will possess it,
c44402	and the great owl and raven will dwell in it.
c44403	The LORD will stretch out over [Edom] a measuring line of chaos and a plumb line of destruction.
c44404	nobles
c44405	No ... will be left to proclaim a king,
c44406	and all her princes will come to nothing.
c44407	Her towers will be overgrown with thorns,
c44408	her fortresses with thistles and briers.
c44409	She will become a haunt for jackals,
c44410	an abode for ostriches.
c44411	The desert creatures will meet with hyenas,
c44412	and one wild goat will call to another.
c44413	There the nocturnal creature will settle
c44414	and find her place of repose.
c44415	There the owl will make her nest;
c44416	she will lay
c44417	and hatch her eggs
c44418	and gather her brood under her shadow.
c44419	Even there the birds of prey will gather, each with its mate.
c44420	Search ... the scroll of the LORD:
c44421	and read
c44422	Not one of these will go missing,
c44423	not one will lack her mate,
c44424	because ... it by His mouth,
c44425	He has ordered
c44426	by His Spirit.
c44427	and He will gather them
c44428	He has allotted their portion;
c44429	His hand has distributed it by measure.
c44430	They will possess it forever;
c44431	they will dwell in it from generation to generation.
c44432	The wilderness and the land will be glad;
c44433	the desert will rejoice
c44434	and blossom like a rose.
c44435	It will bloom abundantly
c44436	and even rejoice with joy
c44437	and singing.
c44438	The glory of Lebanon will be given it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon.
c44439	They will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God.
c44440	Strengthen the limp hands
c44441	and steady the feeble knees!
c44442	Say to those with anxious hearts:
c44443	“Be strong,
c44444	do not fear!
c44445	Behold, your God will come with vengeance. With divine retribution
c44446	He will come
c44447	to save you.”
c44448	Then the eyes of the blind will be opened
c44449	and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
c44450	Then the lame will leap like a deer
c44451	and the mute tongue will shout for joy.
c44452	For waters will gush forth in the wilderness,
c44453	and streams in the desert.
c44454	The parched ground will become a pool,
c44455	the thirsty land springs of water.
c44456	In the haunt where jackals once lay,
c44457	there will be grass [and] reeds and papyrus.
c44458	And there will be a highway
c44460	the Way of Holiness.
c44461	called
c44462	The unclean will not travel it,
c44463	only
c44464	those who walk in that Way— and fools will not stray onto it.
c44465	No lion will be there,
c44466	and no vicious beast will go up on it.
c44467	Such will not be found there,
c44468	but the redeemed will walk upon it,
c44469	and the ransomed of the LORD will return.
c44470	They will enter Zion with singing,
c44471	crowned with everlasting joy.
c44472	Joy and gladness will overtake them,
c44473	and sorrow and sighing will flee.
c44474	In the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah,
c44475	Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked ... all the fortified cities of Judah.
c44476	and captured
c44477	And the king of Assyria sent [the] Rab-shakeh, with a great army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem.
c44478	And he stopped by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field.
c44479	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah ... went out to him.
c44480	the palace administrator,
c44481	Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder,
c44482	The Rab-shakeh said to them,
c44483	“Tell Hezekiah
c44484	that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says:
c44485	‘What ... [of] this confidence
c44486	is the basis ... of yours?
c44487	You claim
c44488	[to have] a strategy and strength for war, but [these are] empty words.
c44489	On whom are you now relying,
c44490	that you have rebelled against me?
c44491	Look now, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff ... on it.
c44492	that ... of anyone who leans ... in him.
c44493	the hand
c44494	will pierce
c44495	Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all
c44496	who trust
c44497	But if you say to me,
c44498	“We trust in the LORD our God,”
c44499	is He not
c44500	the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed,
c44501	saying to Judah and Jerusalem,
c44502	“You must worship before this altar”?
c44503	Now therefore,
c44504	make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria.
c44505	I will give you two thousand horses—
c44506	if you can
c44507	put riders on them!
c44508	For how can you repel a single officer among the weakest of my master’s servants
c44509	when you depend on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
c44510	So now,
c44511	was it apart from the LORD that I have come up against this land
c44512	to destroy it?
c44513	The LORD Himself said to me,
c44514	‘Go up against this land
c44515	and destroy it.’”
c44516	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh,
c44517	“Please speak to your servants in Aramaic,
c44518	since we understand it.
c44519	Do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people
c44520	on the wall.”
c44521	But the Rab-shakeh replied,
c44522	“Has my master sent ... only to you and your master,
c44523	me to speak these words
c44524	and not to the men
c44525	sitting on the wall,
c44526	to eat their own dung
c44527	who are destined with you ... and drink their own urine?”
c44528	Then the Rab-shakeh stood
c44529	and called out loudly in Hebrew:
c44531	“Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
c44532	This is what the king says:
c44533	Do not let Hezekiah deceive you,
c44534	for he cannot
c44535	deliver you.
c44536	Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD
c44537	when he says,
c44538	‘The LORD will surely deliver us;
c44539	this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
c44540	Do not listen to Hezekiah,
c44541	for this is what the king of Assyria says:
c44542	Make peace with me
c44543	and come out to me.
c44544	Then every one of you will eat from his own vine
c44545	and his own fig tree,
c44546	and drink water from his own cistern,
c44547	until I come
c44548	and take you away to a land like your own— a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
c44549	Do not let Hezekiah mislead
c44550	you when he says,
c44551	‘The LORD will deliver us.’
c44552	Has the god ... nation ever delivered
c44553	of any ... his land
c44554	from the hand of the king of Assyria?
c44555	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?
c44556	Where are the gods of Sepharvaim?
c44557	Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
c44558	Who among all the gods of these lands
c44559	has delivered his land from my hand?
c44560	How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”
c44561	But [the people] remained silent
c44562	and did not answer a word,
c44563	for [Hezekiah] had commanded,
c44566	“Do not answer him.”
c44567	Then Hilkiah’s son Eliakim ... came
c44568	the palace administrator,
c44569	Shebna the court secretary, and Asaph’s son Joah the court historian, ... to Hezekiah with their clothes torn,
c44570	and they relayed to him the words of [the] Rab-shakeh.
c44571	On
c44572	hearing [this report], King Hezekiah
c44573	tore his clothes,
c44574	put on sackcloth,
c44575	and entered the house of the LORD.
c44576	He sent Eliakim
c44577	the palace administrator,
c44578	Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests,
c44579	all wearing sackcloth,
c44580	to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz
c44581	to tell him,
c44582	“This is what Hezekiah says:
c44583	Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace;
c44584	for children have come to the point of birth,
c44585	but there is no strength to deliver them.
c44586	Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rab-shakeh,
c44587	whom his master the king of Assyria has sent
c44588	to defy the living God,
c44589	and He will rebuke him for the words
c44590	that the LORD your God has heard.
c44591	Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that still survives.”
c44592	So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah,
c44593	who replied,
c44594	“Tell your master
c44595	that this is what the LORD says:
c44596	‘Do not be afraid of the words
c44597	you have heard, with which
c44598	the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
c44599	Behold, I will put a spirit in him
c44600	so that he will hear a rumor
c44601	and return to his own land,
c44602	where I will cause him to fall by the sword.’”
c44603	the Rab-shakeh ... he withdrew
c44604	and found the king
c44605	fighting against Libnah.
c44606	When ... heard
c44607	that the king of Assyria had left Lachish,
c44608	Now Sennacherib had been warned about Tirhakah king of Cush:
c44610	“He has set out
c44611	to fight against you.”
c44612	On hearing this,
c44613	Sennacherib sent messengers to Hezekiah
c44614	with the order:
c44615	“Tell Hezekiah king of Judah,
c44616	by promising
c44617	‘Do not let your God, ... deceive you
c44618	in whom you trust,
c44620	that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
c44621	Surely you have heard
c44622	what the kings of Assyria have done to all [the other] countries,
c44623	destroying them completely.
c44624	Will you then be spared?
c44625	Did the gods of the nations ... rescue them— [the gods of]
c44626	my fathers destroyed
c44627	Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden
c44628	in Telassar?
c44629	Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”
c44630	So Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers,
c44631	read it,
c44632	and went up to the house of the LORD
c44633	and spread it out before the LORD.
c44634	And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
c44636	“O LORD of Hosts, God of Israel,
c44637	enthroned above the cherubim,
c44638	You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth.
c44639	You made the heavens and the earth.
c44640	Incline
c44641	O LORD,
c44642	Your ear,
c44643	and hear;
c44644	open
c44645	O LORD,
c44646	Your eyes,
c44647	and see.
c44648	Listen to all the words ... Sennacherib
c44649	that ... has sent
c44650	to defy the living God.
c44651	Truly, O LORD,
c44652	the kings of Assyria have laid waste all these countries and their lands.
c44653	They have cast their gods into the fire
c44654	for they were not gods,
c44655	but only wood and stone— the work of human hands.
c44656	and destroyed them,
c44657	And now,
c44658	O LORD our God,
c44659	deliver us from his hand,
c44660	so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know
c44661	that You alone, O LORD, are God.”
c44662	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah:
c44664	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c44665	Because you prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
c44666	this is the word
c44667	that the LORD has spoken against him:
c44668	despises you
c44669	‘The Virgin Daughter of Zion ... and mocks you;
c44670	the Daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you.
c44671	Whom have you taunted
c44672	and blasphemed?
c44673	Against whom have you raised your voice
c44674	and lifted your eyes in pride?
c44675	Against the Holy One of Israel!
c44676	Through your servants you have taunted the Lord,
c44677	and you have said"
c44678	“With my many chariots I have ascended to the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon.
c44679	I have cut down its tallest cedars, the finest of its cypress trees.
c44680	I have reached its farthest heights, the densest of its forests.
c44681	I have dug wells
c44682	and drunk foreign waters.
c44683	With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.”
c44684	Have you not heard? Long ago
c44685	I ordained it; in days of old
c44686	I planned it.
c44687	Now I have brought it to pass,
c44689	that you should crush fortified cities into piles of rubble.
c44690	Therefore their inhabitants, devoid of power,
c44691	are dismayed
c44692	and ashamed.
c44693	They are plants of the field, tender green shoots, grass on the roofs, scorched before it is grown.
c44695	your sitting down,
c44696	your going out
c44697	and coming in,
c44698	But I know
c44700	and your raging against Me.
c44701	Because your rage ... against Me
c44702	and arrogance ... have reached My ears,
c44703	I will put My hook in your nose
c44704	and My bit in your mouth;
c44705	I will send you back the way
c44706	you came.’
c44707	And this will be a sign to you, [O Hezekiah]:
c44708	This year you will eat what grows on its own,
c44709	and in the second year what springs from the same.
c44710	But in the third year you will sow
c44711	and reap;
c44712	you will plant vineyards
c44713	and eat their fruit.
c44714	And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root below
c44715	and bear fruit above.
c44716	For a remnant will go forth from Jerusalem,
c44717	and survivors from Mount Zion.
c44718	The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.
c44719	So this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria:
c44720	‘He will not enter this city
c44721	or shoot an arrow into it.
c44722	He will not come before it with a shield
c44723	or build up a siege ramp against it.
c44724	the way
c44725	he came,
c44726	He will go back
c44727	and he will not enter this city,
c44728	declares the LORD.
c44729	I will defend this city
c44730	and rescue it for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.’”
c44731	Then the angel of the LORD went out
c44732	and struck down 185,000men in the camp of the Assyrians.
c44733	When the people got up the next morning,
c44734	there were all the dead bodies!
c44735	broke camp
c44736	and withdrew.
c44737	So Sennacherib king of Assyria ... He returned home
c44738	to Nineveh and stayed there.
c44739	One day,
c44740	while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch,
c44741	his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword
c44742	and escaped to the land of Ararat.
c44743	And his son Esar-haddon became king in his place.
c44744	In those days Hezekiah ... ill.
c44745	became mortally
c44746	The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him
c44747	and said,
c44748	“This is what the LORD says:
c44749	‘Put your house in order,
c44750	for you are about to die;
c44751	you will not recover.’”
c44752	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall
c44753	and prayed to the LORD,
c44754	saying,
c44755	“Please, O LORD,
c44756	remember
c44757	how I have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion;
c44758	I have done [what is] good in Your sight.”
c44759	And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
c44760	And the word of the LORD came to Isaiah,
c44761	saying,
c44762	“Go
c44763	and tell Hezekiah
c44764	that this is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says:
c44765	I have heard your prayer;
c44766	I have seen your tears;
c44767	behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
c44768	And I will deliver you ... from the hand of the king of Assyria;
c44769	and this city
c44770	I will defend this city.
c44771	This will be a sign to you from the LORD
c44772	that He will do what
c44773	He has promised:
c44774	shadow ... on the stairway ... go
c44775	I will make the sun’s ... that falls ... of Ahaz ... steps
c44776	ten ... backward.”
c44777	So [the shadow cast by] the sun went back the ten steps
c44778	it had descended.
c44779	[This is] a writing by Hezekiah king of Judah
c44780	after his illness
c44781	and recovery:
c44782	“I said that
c44783	in the prime of my life I must go to the gates of Sheol;
c44784	I will be deprived of the remainder of my years.
c44785	I said that
c44786	I will never see the LORD,
c44787	[even] the LORD, in the land of the living;
c44788	I will no longer look on mankind with those who dwell in this world.
c44789	My dwelling has been picked up
c44790	and removed from me like a shepherd’s tent.
c44791	I have rolled up my life like a weaver;
c44792	He cuts me off from the loom.
c44793	From day until night You make an end of me.
c44794	I composed myself until the morning.
c44795	Like a lion
c44796	He breaks all my bones;
c44797	from day until night You make an end of me.
c44798	like a swallow or crane;
c44799	I chirp
c44800	I moan like a dove.
c44801	My eyes grow weak [as I look] upward.
c44802	O Lord,
c44803	I am oppressed;
c44804	be my security.
c44805	What can I say?
c44806	He has spoken to me,
c44807	and He Himself has done this.
c44808	I will walk slowly all my years because of the anguish of my soul.
c44809	O Lord,
c44810	by [such things] men live,
c44811	and in all [of them] my spirit [finds] life.
c44812	You have restored me to health
c44813	and let me live.
c44814	Surely, for my welfare I had such great anguish;
c44815	but Your love has delivered me from the pit of oblivion,
c44816	for You have cast all my sins behind Your back.
c44817	For Sheol cannot thank You;
c44818	death cannot praise You.
c44819	Those who go down to the Pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness.
c44820	The living, only the living,
c44821	can thank You, as I do today;
c44822	fathers will tell their children about Your faithfulness.
c44823	The LORD
c44824	will save me;
c44825	we will play songs on stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the LORD.”
c44826	Now Isaiah had said,
c44827	“Prepare a lump of pressed figs
c44828	and apply it to the boil,
c44829	and he will recover.”
c44830	And Hezekiah had asked,
c44831	“What will be the sign
c44832	that I will go up to the house of the LORD?”
c44833	At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah,
c44834	for he had heard
c44835	about [Hezekiah’s] illness
c44836	and recovery.
c44837	And Hezekiah welcomed [the envoys]
c44838	and showed them what was in his treasure house— the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, as well as his entire armory— everything
c44839	that was found in his storehouses.
c44840	There was nothing
c44841	that Hezekiah did not show them.
c44842	in his palace or in all his dominion
c44843	Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah
c44844	and asked, ... to you?”
c44845	did those [men] ... and what did they say
c44846	“From where ... come, ... from
c44847	Hezekiah replied,
c44848	“They came to me ... a distant land,” ... “from Babylon.”
c44849	Isaiah asked.
c44850	“What have they seen in your palace?”
c44851	answered Hezekiah.
c44852	everything
c44853	in my palace,” ... that
c44854	“They have seen
c44855	“There is nothing
c44856	I did not show them.”
c44857	among my treasures
c44858	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah,
c44859	“Hear the word of the LORD of Hosts:
c44860	The time will surely come
c44861	when everything ... will be carried off
c44862	in your palace and all that
c44863	your fathers have stored up until this day
c44864	to Babylon.
c44865	Nothing will be left,
c44866	says the LORD.
c44867	And some of your descendants,
c44868	your
c44869	own flesh and blood,
c44870	will be taken away
c44871	to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
c44872	But Hezekiah said to Isaiah,
c44873	“The word of the LORD ... is good.”
c44874	that you have spoken
c44875	For he thought,
c44876	“At least there will be peace and security in my lifetime.”
c44877	“Comfort,
c44878	comfort My people,”
c44879	says your God.
c44880	“Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
c44881	and proclaim to her
c44882	that her forced labor has been completed,
c44883	her iniquity has been pardoned; for
c44884	she has received from the hand of the LORD double for all her sins.”
c44885	A voice of one calling:
c44886	“Prepare the way for the LORD in the wilderness;
c44887	make a straight highway for our God in the desert.
c44888	Every valley shall be lifted up,
c44889	and every mountain and hill made low;
c44890	the uneven ground will become smooth,
c44891	and the rugged land a plain.
c44892	And the glory of the LORD will be revealed,
c44893	and all mankind together will see it.
c44894	For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”
c44895	A voice says,
c44896	“Cry out!”
c44897	And I asked,
c44898	“What should I cry out?”
c44899	“All flesh is like grass,
c44900	and all its glory like the flowers of the field.
c44901	The grass withers,
c44902	the flowers fall
c44903	when the breath of the LORD blows on them;
c44904	indeed, the people are grass.
c44905	The grass withers
c44906	[and] the flowers fall,
c44907	but the word of our God stands forever.”
c44908	Go up on a high mountain,
c44909	O Zion, herald of good news.
c44910	Raise your voice loudly,
c44911	O Jerusalem, herald of good news.
c44912	Lift [it] up,
c44913	do not be afraid!
c44914	Say to the cities of Judah,
c44915	“Here is your God!”
c44916	Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might,
c44917	and His arm establishes His rule.
c44918	His reward is with Him,
c44919	and His recompense accompanies Him.
c44920	He tends His flock like a shepherd;
c44921	He gathers the lambs in His arms
c44922	and carries them close to His heart.
c44923	He gently leads the nursing [ewes].
c44924	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
c44925	or marked off the heavens with the span of his hand?
c44926	Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket,
c44927	or weighed the mountains on a scale
c44928	and the hills with a balance?
c44929	Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD,
c44930	counsel?
c44931	or who has given Him
c44932	Whom did He consult
c44933	to enlighten Him,
c44934	and who taught Him the paths of justice?
c44935	Who imparted knowledge to Him
c44936	and showed Him the way of understanding?
c44937	Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;
c44938	they are considered a speck of dust on the scales;
c44939	the islands like fine dust.
c44940	He lifts up
c44941	Lebanon [is] not sufficient
c44942	for fuel,
c44943	nor its animals enough for a burnt offering.
c44944	All the nations are as nothing before Him;
c44945	He regards them as nothingness and emptiness.
c44946	To whom will you liken God?
c44947	To what image
c44948	will you compare Him?
c44949	To an idol that a craftsman casts
c44950	and a metalworker overlays with gold
c44951	and fits with silver chains?
c44952	To one bereft of an offering
c44953	wood
c44954	that does not rot?
c44955	who chooses
c44956	He looks for a skilled craftsman
c44957	to set up an idol
c44958	that will not fall over.
c44959	Do you not know?
c44960	Have you not heard?
c44961	Has it not been declared to you from the beginning?
c44962	Have you not understood since the foundation of the earth?
c44963	He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth;
c44964	its dwellers are like grasshoppers.
c44965	He stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
c44966	and spreads them out like a tent
c44967	to live in.
c44968	He brings the princes to nothing
c44969	and makes the judges of the earth meaningless.
c44970	No sooner are they planted,
c44971	no sooner are they sown,
c44972	no sooner have their stems taken root in the ground,
c44973	than He blows on them
c44974	and they wither,
c44975	and a whirlwind sweeps them away like stubble.
c44976	“To whom will you compare Me,
c44977	or who is My equal?”
c44978	asks the Holy One.
c44979	Lift up your eyes on high:
c44981	Who created all these?
c44982	He leads forth the starry host by number;
c44983	He calls each one by name.
c44984	Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
c44985	Why do you say,
c44986	O Jacob,
c44987	and why do you assert,
c44988	O Israel,
c44989	“My way is hidden from the LORD,
c44990	and my claim is ignored by my God”?
c44991	Do you not know?
c44992	Have you not heard?
c44993	The LORD is the everlasting God,
c44994	the Creator of the ends of the earth.
c44995	He will never grow faint
c44996	or weary;
c44997	His understanding is beyond searching out.
c44998	He gives power to the faint
c44999	and increases the strength of the weak.
c45000	Even the youths may faint
c45001	and grow weary,
c45002	and young men stumble and fall.
c45003	But those who wait upon the LORD will renew their strength;
c45004	they will mount up with wings like eagles;
c45005	they will run
c45006	and not grow weary;
c45007	they will walk
c45008	and not faint.
c45009	“Be silent before Me,
c45010	O islands,
c45011	and let the peoples renew their strength.
c45012	Let them come forward
c45013	and testify;
c45014	let us together draw near for judgment.
c45015	Who has aroused the one from the east
c45016	[and] called him to his feet in righteousness?
c45017	He hands nations over to him
c45018	[and] subdues kings [before him].
c45019	He turns them to dust with his sword,
c45020	to windblown chaff with his bow.
c45021	He pursues them,
c45022	going on safely, ... the path
c45023	hardly touching ... with his feet.
c45024	Who has performed this
c45025	and carried it out,
c45026	calling forth the generations from the beginning?
c45027	I, the LORD— the first
c45028	and the last— I am He.”
c45029	The islands see
c45030	and fear,
c45031	the ends of the earth tremble.
c45032	They approach
c45033	and come forward.
c45034	Each one ... the other,
c45035	helps
c45036	and says to his brother,
c45037	“Be strong!”
c45038	The craftsman encourages the goldsmith,
c45039	[and] he who wields the hammer [cheers] him who strikes the anvil,
c45040	saying of the soldering,
c45041	“It is good.”
c45042	He nails it down
c45043	so it will not be toppled.
c45044	But you,
c45045	O Israel, My servant,
c45046	Jacob,
c45047	whom I have chosen,
c45048	descendant of Abraham My friend—
c45049	I brought you from the ends of the earth
c45050	and called you from its farthest corners.
c45051	I said,
c45052	“You are My servant.”
c45053	I have chosen
c45054	and not rejected you.
c45055	Do not fear,
c45056	for I am with you;
c45057	do not be afraid,
c45058	for I am your God.
c45059	I will strengthen you;
c45060	I will surely help you;
c45061	I will uphold you with My right hand of righteousness.
c45062	Behold, ... will be ashamed
c45063	all ... and disgraced;
c45064	who rage against you
c45065	will be reduced to nothing
c45066	those who contend with you ... and will perish.
c45067	You will seek
c45068	[them] but will not find them.
c45069	Those who wage war against you will come to nothing.
c45070	For I am the LORD your God,
c45071	who takes hold of your right hand
c45072	and says to you:
c45073	“Do not fear,
c45074	I will help you.”
c45075	Do not fear,
c45076	O worm Jacob,
c45077	O few men of Israel.
c45078	I will help you,
c45079	declares the LORD.
c45080	Your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
c45081	Behold, I will make you into a threshing sledge, new [and] sharp, with many teeth.
c45082	You will thresh the mountains
c45083	and crush them,
c45084	and reduce the hills to chaff.
c45085	You will winnow them,
c45086	and a wind will carry them away;
c45087	a gale will scatter them.
c45088	But you will rejoice in the LORD;
c45089	you will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
c45090	The poor and needy seek water,
c45091	but there is none;
c45092	their tongues are parched with thirst.
c45093	I, the LORD,
c45094	will answer them;
c45095	I, the God of Israel,
c45096	will not forsake them.
c45097	I will open rivers on the barren heights,
c45098	and fountains in the middle of the valleys.
c45099	I will turn the desert into a pool of water,
c45100	and the dry land into flowing springs.
c45101	I will plant cedars in the desert, acacias, myrtles, and olive trees.
c45102	I will set evergreens in the desert, elms and cypress trees together,
c45103	so that ... may see
c45104	and know,
c45105	may consider
c45106	all ... and understand,
c45107	that the hand of the LORD has done this,
c45108	the Holy One of Israel has created it.
c45109	“Present your case,”
c45110	says the LORD.
c45111	“Submit your arguments,”
c45112	says the King of Jacob.
c45113	“Let them come
c45114	and tell us
c45115	what will happen.
c45116	the former things,
c45118	Tell
c45119	so that we may reflect on them
c45120	and know the outcome.
c45121	Or announce to us what is coming.
c45122	Tell us
c45123	the things that are to come,
c45124	so that we may know
c45125	that you are gods.
c45126	Yes, do something good
c45127	or evil,
c45128	that we may look on together in dismay.
c45130	Behold, you are nothing
c45131	and your work is of no value.
c45132	you is detestable.
c45133	Anyone who chooses
c45134	“I have raised up [one] from the north,
c45135	and he has come—
c45136	one from the east who calls on My name.
c45137	He will march over rulers as if they were mortar,
c45138	like a potter
c45139	who treads the clay.
c45140	Who has declared [this] from the beginning,
c45141	so that we may know,
c45142	and from times past,
c45143	so that we may say:
c45144	‘He was right’?
c45145	No one announced it,
c45146	no one foretold it,
c45147	no one heard your words.
c45148	I was the first to tell Zion:
c45149	‘Look, here they are!’
c45150	to Jerusalem
c45151	And I gave ... a herald of good news.
c45152	When I look,
c45153	there is no one;
c45154	among them;
c45155	there is no counselor
c45156	when I ask them,
c45157	they have nothing to say.
c45158	See, [they are] all a delusion;
c45159	their works amount to nothing;
c45160	their images are as empty as the wind.
c45161	Here is My Servant,
c45162	whom I uphold,
c45163	My Chosen One,
c45164	[in whom] My soul delights.
c45165	I will put My Spirit on Him,
c45166	[and] He will bring justice to the nations.
c45167	He will not cry out
c45168	[or] raise [His voice],
c45169	nor make His voice heard in the streets.
c45170	A bruised reed He will not break
c45171	and a smoldering wick
c45172	He will not extinguish;
c45173	He will faithfully bring forth justice.
c45174	He will not grow weak
c45175	or discouraged
c45176	until He has established justice on the earth.
c45177	In His law the islands will put their hope.”
c45178	Thus says God the LORD—
c45179	He who created the heavens
c45180	and stretched them out,
c45181	who spread out the earth and its offspring,
c45182	who gives breath to the people on it
c45183	and life
c45184	to those who walk in it—
c45185	“I, the LORD, have called you for a righteous purpose,
c45186	and I will take hold of your hand.
c45187	I will keep you
c45188	and appoint you to be a covenant for the people and a light to the nations,
c45189	to open the eyes of the blind,
c45190	to bring prisoners out of the dungeon,
c45191	and those sitting in darkness out from the prison house.
c45192	I am the LORD;
c45193	that is My name!
c45194	I will not give My glory to another
c45195	or My praise to idols.
c45196	the former things
c45197	Behold, ... have happened,
c45198	and now I declare new things.
c45199	Before they spring forth
c45200	I proclaim them to you.”
c45201	Sing to the LORD a new song,
c45202	His praise from the ends of the earth,
c45203	you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it,
c45204	you islands, and all who dwell there.
c45205	Let the desert and its cities raise their voices; [let] the villages
c45206	of Kedar [cry aloud].
c45207	Let the people of Sela sing for joy;
c45208	let them cry out from the mountaintops.
c45209	Let them give glory to the LORD
c45210	and declare His praise in the islands.
c45211	The LORD will go forth like a warrior;
c45212	He will stir up His zeal like a soldier.
c45213	He will shout;
c45214	yes, He will roar.
c45215	He will prevail against His enemies.
c45216	I have kept silent from ages past;
c45217	I have kept quiet
c45218	and restrained.
c45219	But now I will groan like a woman in labor;
c45220	gasp
c45221	I will at once ... and pant.
c45222	I will lay waste the mountains and hills
c45223	and dry up all their vegetation.
c45224	I will turn the rivers into islands
c45225	and dry up the marshes.
c45226	I will lead the blind by a way
c45227	they did not know;
c45228	paths.
c45229	on unfamiliar
c45230	I will guide them
c45231	I will turn darkness into light before them
c45232	and rough places into level ground.
c45233	These things
c45234	I will do for them,
c45235	and I will not forsake them.
c45236	will be turned back
c45237	in utter shame.
c45238	But those who trust in idols
c45239	and say to molten images:
c45240	‘You are our gods!’
c45241	you deaf,
c45242	“Listen,
c45244	you blind,
c45245	and look,
c45246	that you may see.
c45247	Who is blind
c45248	but My servant,
c45249	or deaf like the messenger
c45250	I am sending?
c45251	Who is blind like My covenant partner,
c45252	or blind like the servant of the LORD?
c45253	Though seeing many things,
c45254	you do not observe.
c45255	Though your ears are open,
c45256	you hear nothing.”
c45257	The LORD was pleased for the sake of His righteousness,
c45258	to magnify His law
c45259	and make it glorious.
c45260	But this is a people plundered and looted,
c45261	all trapped in caves
c45262	or imprisoned in dungeons.
c45263	They have become plunder
c45264	with no one to rescue them,
c45265	and loot
c45266	with no one to say,
c45267	“Send them back!”
c45268	Who among you will pay attention to this?
c45269	[Who] will listen
c45270	and obey hereafter?
c45271	Who gave Jacob up for spoil,
c45272	and Israel to the plunderers?
c45273	Was it not the LORD,
c45274	against whom we have sinned?
c45275	They were unwilling
c45276	to walk in His ways,
c45277	and they would not obey His law.
c45278	So He poured out on them His furious anger and the fierceness of battle.
c45279	It enveloped them in flames,
c45280	but they did not understand;
c45281	it consumed them,
c45282	but they did not take it to heart.
c45283	Now this is what the LORD says— He who created you,
c45284	O Jacob,
c45285	and He who formed you,
c45286	O Israel:
c45287	“Do not fear,
c45288	for I have redeemed you;
c45289	I have called you by your name;
c45290	you are Mine!
c45291	When you pass through the waters,
c45292	I will be with you;
c45293	and [when you go through] the rivers,
c45294	they will not overwhelm you.
c45295	When you walk through the fire,
c45296	you will not be scorched,
c45297	and the flames will not set you ablaze
c45298	For I [am] the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior;
c45299	I give Egypt [for] your ransom,
c45300	Cush and Seba in your place.
c45301	Because you are precious ... in My sight,
c45302	and honored
c45303	and [because] I love you,
c45304	I will give men in exchange for you
c45305	and nations in place of your life.
c45306	Do not be afraid,
c45307	for I am with you;
c45308	I will bring your offspring from the east,
c45309	and gather you from the west.
c45310	I will say to the north,
c45311	‘Give them up!’
c45312	and to the south,
c45313	‘Do not hold them back!’
c45314	Bring My sons from afar,
c45315	and My daughters from the ends of the earth—
c45316	everyone
c45317	called by My name
c45318	and created for My glory,
c45319	whom I have indeed formed
c45320	[and] made.”
c45321	Bring out a people ... but are blind,
c45322	who have eyes
c45323	but are deaf.
c45324	and who have ears
c45325	All the nations gather together
c45326	and the peoples assemble.
c45327	Who among them have declared this,
c45328	and foretold the former things?
c45329	Let them present their witnesses
c45330	to vindicate themselves,
c45331	so that others may hear
c45332	and say,
c45333	“It is true.”
c45334	“You are My witnesses,”
c45335	declares the LORD,
c45336	“and My servant
c45337	whom I have chosen,
c45338	so that you may know
c45339	and believe Me
c45340	and understand
c45341	that I am He.
c45342	Before Me, no god was formed,
c45343	and none will come after Me.
c45344	I,
c45345	yes I, am the LORD,
c45346	and there is no Savior but Me.
c45347	I alone decreed
c45348	and saved
c45349	and proclaimed—
c45350	[I,] and not some foreign god among you.
c45351	So you are My witnesses,”
c45352	declares the LORD,
c45353	“that I am God.
c45354	Even from eternity I [am] He,
c45355	and none can deliver out of My hand.
c45356	When I act,
c45357	who can reverse it?”
c45358	Thus says the LORD your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
c45359	“For your sake, I will send to Babylon
c45360	and bring them all as fugitives,
c45361	even the Chaldeans, in the ships in which they rejoice.
c45362	I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, [and] your King.”
c45363	Thus says the LORD—
c45364	He who makes a way in the sea,
c45365	and a path through surging waters,
c45366	who brings out the chariots and horses, the armies and warriors
c45367	together, to lie down
c45368	[and] never rise again,
c45369	to be extinguished,
c45370	quenched like a wick—
c45371	“Do not call to mind the former things;
c45372	pay no attention to things of old.
c45373	Behold, I am about to do something new;
c45374	even now it is coming.
c45375	Do you not see it?
c45376	Indeed, I will make a way in the wilderness
c45377	[and] streams in the desert.
c45378	The animals of the field will honor Me, the jackals and the owls,
c45379	because I provide water in the wilderness,
c45380	[and] rivers in the desert,
c45381	to give drink to My chosen people.
c45382	The people
c45383	I formed for Myself
c45384	will declare My praise.
c45385	But you have not called on Me,
c45386	O Jacob,
c45387	because you have grown weary of Me,
c45388	O Israel.
c45389	You have not brought Me sheep for burnt offerings,
c45390	nor honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not
c45391	burdened you with offerings,
c45392	nor wearied you with incense.
c45393	You have bought Me no sweet cane with [your] silver,
c45394	nor have you satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices.
c45395	But you have burdened Me with your sins;
c45396	you have wearied Me with your iniquities.
c45397	I,
c45398	yes I, am He who
c45399	blots out your transgressions for My own sake
c45400	and remembers your sins no more.
c45401	Remind Me,
c45402	let us argue the matter together.
c45403	State your case, ... you
c45404	so that ... may be vindicated.
c45405	Your first father sinned,
c45406	and your spokesmen rebelled against Me.
c45407	So I will disgrace the princes of your sanctuary,
c45408	and consign Jacob to destruction
c45409	and Israel to reproach.
c45410	But now listen,
c45411	O Jacob My servant,
c45412	Israel,
c45413	whom I have chosen.
c45414	This is the word of the LORD, your Maker, who formed you from the womb
c45415	[and] will help you:
c45416	Do not be afraid,
c45417	O Jacob My servant,
c45418	Jeshurun,
c45419	whom I have chosen.
c45420	For I will pour water on the thirsty land,
c45421	and currents on the dry ground;
c45422	I will pour out My Spirit on your descendants,
c45423	and My blessing on your offspring.
c45424	They will sprout among the grass like poplars by flowing streams.
c45425	One will say,
c45426	‘I [belong] to the LORD,’
c45427	another will call himself by the name of Jacob,
c45428	and still another will write on his hand, ‘The LORD’s,’
c45429	and will take the name of Israel.”
c45430	Thus says the LORD, the King and Redeemer of Israel, the LORD of Hosts:
c45431	“I am the first
c45432	and I am the last,
c45433	and there is no God but Me.
c45434	Who then [is] like Me?
c45435	Let him say so!
c45436	Let him declare
c45437	[his] case before Me,
c45438	since I established an ancient people.
c45439	the things to come,
c45440	and what is to take place.
c45441	Let him foretell
c45442	Do not tremble
c45443	[or] fear.
c45444	Have I not told you ... long ago?
c45445	and declared it
c45446	You are My witnesses!
c45447	Is there any God but Me?
c45448	There is no other Rock;
c45449	I know not one.”
c45450	makers of idols
c45451	All ... are nothing,
c45452	and the things they treasure are worthless.
c45453	Their witnesses
c45454	fail to see
c45455	or know anything,
c45456	so they are put to shame.
c45457	Who fashions a god
c45458	or casts an idol
c45459	which profits him nothing?
c45460	Behold, all his companions will be put to shame,
c45461	for the craftsmen
c45462	themselves are only human.
c45463	Let them all assemble
c45464	and take their stand;
c45465	be brought to terror
c45466	they will all ... and shame.
c45467	The blacksmith takes a tool
c45468	and labors over the coals;
c45469	he fashions [an idol] with hammers
c45470	and forges [it] with his strong arms.
c45471	Yet he grows hungry
c45472	and his strength fails;
c45473	he fails to drink water
c45474	and grows faint.
c45475	The woodworker extends a measuring line;
c45476	he marks it out with a stylus;
c45477	he shapes it with chisels
c45478	and outlines it with a compass.
c45479	He fashions it in the likeness of man, like man in all his glory,
c45480	that it may dwell in a shrine.
c45481	He cuts down cedars
c45482	or retrieves a cypress or oak.
c45483	He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest.
c45484	He plants a laurel,
c45485	and the rain makes it grow.
c45486	It serves ... for man.
c45487	as fuel
c45488	He takes some of it
c45489	to warm himself,
c45490	and he kindles a fire
c45491	and bakes [his] bread;
c45492	he even fashions it into a god
c45493	and worships it;
c45494	he makes an idol
c45495	and bows down to it.
c45496	He burns half of it in the fire, ... on that half.
c45497	meat ... He eats
c45498	and he roasts ... the roast
c45499	and is satisfied.
c45500	Indeed, he warms
c45501	himself and says,
c45502	“Ah! I am warm;
c45503	I see the fire.”
c45504	From the rest he makes a god, his graven image.
c45505	He bows down to it
c45506	and worships;
c45507	he prays to it
c45508	and says,
c45509	“Save me,
c45510	for you are my god.”
c45511	They cannot comprehend
c45512	[or] understand,
c45513	for He has shut
c45514	their eyes so they cannot see,
c45515	and [closed] their minds so they cannot understand.
c45516	And no one considers in his heart,
c45517	no one has the knowledge
c45518	or insight
c45519	to say,
c45520	“I burned half of it in the fire,
c45521	and I baked bread on its coals,
c45522	I roasted meat
c45523	and I ate.
c45524	Shall I make something detestable with the rest of it?
c45525	Shall I bow down to a block of wood?”
c45526	He feeds on ashes.
c45527	heart
c45528	His deluded
c45529	has led him astray,
c45530	and he cannot deliver himself
c45531	[or] say,
c45532	“Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?”
c45533	Remember these things,
c45534	O Jacob,
c45535	O Israel.
c45536	for you are My servant,
c45537	I have made you;
c45538	you are My servant;
c45539	O Israel,
c45540	[I] will never forget [you].
c45541	I have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud,
c45542	and your sins like a mist.
c45543	Return to Me,
c45544	for I have redeemed you.
c45545	Sing for joy,
c45546	O heavens,
c45547	for the LORD has done this;
c45548	shout aloud,
c45549	O depths of the earth.
c45550	Break out
c45551	O mountains,
c45552	into singing,
c45553	you forests and all your trees.
c45554	For the LORD has redeemed Jacob,
c45555	and revealed His glory in Israel.
c45556	Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer who formed you from the womb:
c45557	“I am the LORD,
c45558	who has made all things,
c45559	who alone stretched out the heavens,
c45560	who by Myself spread out the earth,
c45561	who foils the signs of false prophets
c45562	and makes fools of diviners,
c45563	who confounds the wise
c45564	and turns their knowledge into nonsense,
c45565	who confirms the message of His servant
c45566	and fulfills the counsel of His messengers,
c45567	who says of Jerusalem,
c45568	‘She will be inhabited,’
c45569	and of the cities of Judah,
c45570	‘They will be rebuilt,
c45571	and I will restore their ruins,’
c45572	who says to the depths of the sea,
c45573	‘Be dry,
c45574	and I will dry up your currents,’
c45575	who says of Cyrus,
c45576	‘My shepherd
c45577	will fulfill all that I desire,’
c45578	who says of Jerusalem,
c45579	‘She will be rebuilt,’
c45580	and of the temple, ‘Let its foundation be laid.’”
c45581	This is what the LORD says to Cyrus His anointed,
c45582	whose right hand I have grasped
c45583	to subdue nations before him,
c45584	to disarm kings,
c45585	to open the doors before him,
c45586	so that the gates will not be shut:
c45587	“I will go before you
c45588	and level the mountains;
c45589	I will break down the gates of bronze
c45590	and cut through the bars of iron.
c45591	I will give you the treasures of darkness and the hidden riches of secret places,
c45592	so that you may know
c45593	that I [am] the LORD,
c45594	who calls you by name.
c45595	the God of Israel,
c45596	For the sake of Jacob My servant and Israel My chosen one,
c45597	I call you by name;
c45598	I have given you a title of honor,
c45599	though you have not known Me.
c45600	I am the LORD,
c45601	and there is no other;
c45602	there is no God but Me.
c45603	I will equip you for battle,
c45604	though you have not known Me,
c45605	so that all may know, from the rising of the sun to the place of its setting,
c45606	that there is none but Me.
c45607	I am the LORD,
c45608	and there is no other.
c45609	I form light
c45610	and create darkness;
c45611	I bring prosperity
c45612	and create calamity.
c45613	I, the LORD,
c45614	do all these things.
c45615	Drip down,
c45616	O heavens, from above,
c45617	and let the skies pour down righteousness.
c45618	Let the earth open up
c45619	that salvation may sprout
c45620	and righteousness spring up with it;
c45621	I, the LORD, have created it.
c45622	Woe
c45623	to him who quarrels with his Maker—
c45624	one clay pot among many.
c45625	Does the clay ask the potter,
c45626	‘What are you making?’
c45627	Does your work say,
c45628	‘He has no hands’?
c45629	Woe
c45630	to him who says to his father,
c45631	‘What have you begotten?’
c45632	or to his mother,
c45633	‘What have you brought forth?’
c45634	Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker:
c45635	“How dare you question Me
c45636	concerning My sons, or instruct Me about the work of My hands?
c45637	It is I who made the earth,
c45638	and created man upon it.
c45640	It was My hands that stretched out the heavens,
c45641	and I ordained all their host.
c45642	I will raise up [Cyrus] in righteousness,
c45643	and I will make all his ways [straight].
c45644	He will rebuild My city
c45645	and set My exiles free,
c45646	but not for payment
c45647	[or] reward,”
c45648	says the LORD of Hosts.
c45649	This is what the LORD says:
c45650	“The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush, along with the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you
c45651	and will be yours;
c45652	they will trudge behind you;
c45653	they will come over in chains
c45654	and bow down to you.
c45655	They will confess to you:
c45656	‘God is indeed with you,
c45657	and there is no other;
c45658	there is no other God.’”
c45659	Truly You are a God
c45660	who hides Himself,
c45661	O God of Israel,
c45662	the Savior.
c45663	be put to shame
c45664	They will all ... and humiliated;
c45665	the makers of idols will go away together in disgrace.
c45666	[But] Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation;
c45667	you will not be put to shame
c45668	or humiliated, to ages everlasting.
c45669	For thus says the LORD—
c45670	He who created the heavens;
c45671	He [is] God;
c45672	He formed the earth
c45673	and fashioned it;
c45674	He established it;
c45675	He did not create it to be empty,
c45676	it to be inhabited—
c45677	but formed
c45678	“I am the LORD,
c45679	and there is no other.
c45680	I have not spoken in secret, from a place in a land of darkness.
c45681	I did not say to the descendants of Jacob:
c45682	‘Seek Me in a wasteland.’
c45683	I, the LORD,
c45684	speak the truth;
c45685	I say what is right.
c45686	gather together,
c45687	Come,
c45688	and draw near,
c45689	you fugitives of the nations.
c45690	Ignorant [are]
c45691	those who carry idols of wood
c45692	and pray to a god
c45693	that cannot save.
c45694	Speak up
c45695	and present your case—
c45696	yes, let them take counsel together.
c45697	Who foretold this long ago?
c45698	Who announced it from ancient times?
c45699	Was it not I, the LORD?
c45700	There is no other God but Me,
c45701	a righteous God and Savior;
c45702	there is none but Me.
c45703	Turn to Me
c45704	and be saved,
c45705	all the ends of the earth;
c45706	for I [am] God,
c45707	and there is no other.
c45708	By Myself I have sworn;
c45709	truth has gone out from My mouth, a word
c45710	that will not be revoked:
c45711	Every knee will bow before Me,
c45712	every tongue will confess allegiance.
c45713	‘In the LORD alone
c45714	Surely they will say of Me,
c45715	[are] righteousness and strength.’”
c45716	will come to Him
c45717	All ... and be put to shame.
c45718	who rage against Him
c45719	In the LORD ... will find justification
c45720	all descendants of Israel ... and glory.
c45721	Bel crouches;
c45722	Nebo cowers.
c45723	Their idols [weigh down] beasts and cattle.
c45724	The images you carry are burdensome, a load to the weary [animal].
c45725	The gods cower;
c45726	they crouch together,
c45727	unable
c45728	to relieve the burden;
c45729	but they themselves go into captivity.
c45730	Listen to Me,
c45731	O house of Jacob,
c45732	all the remnant of the house of Israel,
c45733	who have been sustained from the womb,
c45734	carried along since birth.
c45735	Even to your old age, I will be the same,
c45736	and I will bear you up when you turn gray.
c45737	I have made you,
c45738	and I will carry you;
c45739	I will sustain you
c45740	and deliver you.
c45741	To whom will you liken Me
c45742	or count Me equal?
c45743	To whom will you compare Me,
c45744	that we should be alike?
c45745	Those who pour out their bags of gold
c45746	and weigh out silver on scales
c45747	hire a goldsmith
c45748	to fashion it into a god
c45749	they can bow down
c45750	and worship.
c45751	They lift
c45752	it to their shoulder and carry it along;
c45753	they set it in its place,
c45754	and there it stands,
c45755	not budging from that spot.
c45756	They cry out to it,
c45757	but it does not answer;
c45758	it saves no one from his troubles.
c45759	Remember this
c45760	and be brave;
c45761	take
c45762	you transgressors!
c45763	it to heart,
c45764	Remember what happened long ago,
c45765	for I am God,
c45766	and there is no other; I am God,
c45767	and [there is] none like Me.
c45768	I distinguish the end from the beginning,
c45769	and ancient times
c45770	from what is still to come,
c45771	saying:
c45772	‘My purpose will be established,
c45773	and I will accomplish all My good pleasure.’
c45774	I summon a bird of prey from the east,
c45775	a man for My purpose from a far-off land.
c45776	Truly I have spoken,
c45777	truly I will bring it to pass.
c45778	I have planned it,
c45779	I will surely do it.
c45780	Listen to Me,
c45781	you stubborn people,
c45782	far removed from righteousness:
c45783	I am bringing My righteousness near;
c45784	it is not far away,
c45785	and My salvation will not be delayed.
c45786	I will grant salvation to Zion, My splendor to Israel.
c45787	Go down
c45788	and sit in the dust,
c45789	O Virgin Daughter of Babylon.
c45790	Sit on the ground
c45791	without a throne,
c45792	O Daughter of Chaldea!
c45793	For you will no longer
c45794	be called tender and delicate.
c45795	Take millstones
c45796	and grind flour;
c45797	remove your veil,
c45798	strip off your skirt,
c45799	bare your thigh,
c45800	wade through the streams.
c45801	Your nakedness will be uncovered
c45802	and your shame will be exposed.
c45803	I will take vengeance;
c45804	I will spare no one.
c45805	Our Redeemer—
c45806	the LORD of Hosts is His name—
c45807	[is] the Holy One of Israel.
c45808	Sit in silence
c45809	and go into darkness,
c45810	O Daughter of Chaldea.
c45811	For you will no longer
c45812	be called the queen of kingdoms.
c45813	I was angry with My people;
c45814	I profaned My heritage,
c45815	and I placed them under your control.
c45816	You showed them no mercy;
c45817	even upon the elderly you laid a most heavy yoke.
c45818	You said,
c45819	‘I will be queen forever.’
c45820	You did not take these things to heart
c45821	or consider their outcome.
c45822	So now
c45823	hear this,
c45824	O lover of luxury,
c45825	who sits securely,
c45826	who says to herself,
c45827	‘I [am],
c45828	and there is none besides me.
c45829	I will never be a widow
c45830	or know the loss of children.’
c45831	These two [things] will overtake you in a moment, in a single day: loss of children, and widowhood.
c45832	They will come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the potency of your spells.
c45833	You were secure in your wickedness;
c45834	you said,
c45835	‘No one sees me.’
c45836	Your wisdom and knowledge
c45837	led you astray;
c45838	you told yourself,
c45839	‘I [am],
c45840	and there is none besides me.’
c45841	But disaster will come upon you;
c45842	you will not know
c45843	how to charm it away.
c45844	A calamity will befall you
c45845	that you will be unable
c45846	to ward off.
c45847	Devastation will happen to you suddenly
c45848	and unexpectedly.
c45849	So take your stand with your spells and with your many sorceries,
c45850	with which you have wearied yourself from your youth.
c45851	Perhaps you will
c45852	succeed;
c45853	perhaps you will inspire terror!
c45854	You are wearied from your many counsels.
c45855	So let them stand
c45856	and save you—
c45857	the astrologers
c45858	who observe the stars,
c45859	who monthly predict
c45860	your fate.
c45861	Surely they are like stubble;
c45862	the fire will burn them up.
c45863	They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame.
c45864	There will be no coals
c45865	to warm them
c45866	or fire
c45867	to sit beside.
c45868	This is what they are to you—
c45869	those with whom you have labored
c45870	and traded from youth—
c45871	each one ... in his own direction;
c45872	strays
c45873	not one of them can save you.
c45874	Listen to this,
c45875	O house of Jacob,
c45876	you who are called by the name of Israel,
c45877	who have descended from the line of Judah,
c45878	who swear by the name of the LORD
c45879	and invoke the God of Israel—
c45880	but not in truth
c45881	[or] righteousness—
c45882	who indeed call yourselves after the Holy City
c45883	and lean on the God of Israel—
c45884	the LORD of Hosts [is] His name.
c45885	I foretold the former things long ago;
c45886	they came out of My mouth;
c45887	I proclaimed them.
c45888	Suddenly I acted,
c45889	and they came to pass.
c45890	For I knew
c45891	that you are stubborn;
c45892	your neck is iron
c45893	and your forehead [is] bronze.
c45894	Therefore I declared it to you long ago;
c45895	before it came to pass,
c45896	I announced it
c45897	so you could not claim,
c45898	‘My idol has done this;
c45899	my carved image and molten god has ordained it.’
c45900	You have heard [these things];
c45901	look at them all.
c45902	Will you
c45903	not acknowledge it?
c45904	From now on I will tell you of new things,
c45905	hidden things
c45906	unknown to you.
c45907	They are created now,
c45908	and not long ago; ... before today,
c45909	you have not heard of them
c45910	so you cannot claim,
c45911	‘I already knew them!’
c45912	You have never heard;
c45913	you have never understood;
c45914	for a long time your ears have not been open.
c45915	For I knew
c45916	how deceitful you are;
c45918	a rebel
c45919	you have been called ... from birth.
c45920	For the sake of My name I will delay My wrath;
c45921	for the sake of My praise I will restrain it,
c45922	so that you will not be cut off.
c45923	See, I have refined you,
c45924	but not as silver;
c45925	I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
c45926	For My own sake,
c45927	My very own sake, I will act;
c45928	for how can I let Myself be defamed?
c45929	I will not yield My glory to another.
c45930	“Listen to Me,
c45931	O Jacob,
c45932	and Israel, whom I have called:
c45933	I am He;
c45934	I am the first,
c45935	and I am the last.
c45936	Surely My own hand founded the earth,
c45937	and My right hand spread out the heavens;
c45938	when I summon them,
c45939	they stand up together.
c45940	Come together,
c45941	all of you,
c45942	and listen:
c45943	Which [of the idols] has foretold these things?
c45944	The LORD’s chosen ally
c45945	will carry out His desire against Babylon,
c45946	and His arm will be against the Chaldeans.
c45947	I,
c45948	even I, have spoken;
c45949	yes, I have called him.
c45950	I have brought him,
c45951	and he will succeed in his mission.
c45952	Come near to Me
c45953	and listen to this:
c45954	“From the beginning I have not spoken in secret;
c45955	from the time
c45956	it took place,
c45957	I was there.”
c45958	And now the Lord GOD has sent me, accompanied by His Spirit.
c45959	Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
c45960	“I am the LORD your God,
c45961	who teaches
c45962	you for your benefit,
c45963	who directs you in the way
c45964	you should go.
c45965	If only you had paid attention to My commandments,
c45966	your peace would have been like a river,
c45967	and your righteousness like waves of the sea.
c45968	Your descendants would have been as countless as the sand,
c45969	and your offspring as its grains;
c45970	would never be cut off
c45971	their name ... or eliminated from My presence.”
c45972	Leave Babylon,
c45973	flee from the Chaldeans!
c45974	Declare it with a shout of joy,
c45975	proclaim it,
c45976	let it go out to the ends of the earth,
c45977	saying,
c45978	“The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob!”
c45979	They did not thirst ... them through the deserts;
c45980	when He led
c45981	He made water flow for them from the rock;
c45982	He split the rock,
c45983	and water gushed out.
c45984	“There is no peace,”
c45985	says the LORD,
c45986	“for the wicked.”
c45987	Listen
c45988	O islands,
c45989	to me,
c45990	and pay attention,
c45991	O distant peoples:
c45992	The LORD called me from the womb;
c45993	from the body of my mother He named me.
c45994	He made my mouth like a sharp sword;
c45995	He hid me in the shadow of His hand.
c45996	He made me like a polished arrow;
c45997	He hid me in His quiver.
c45998	He said to me,
c45999	“You are My servant,
c46000	Israel,
c46001	in whom I will display My glory.”
c46002	But I said,
c46003	“I have labored in vain,
c46004	I have spent my strength in futility and vanity;
c46005	yet my vindication is with the LORD,
c46006	and my reward is with my God.”
c46007	And now says the LORD,
c46008	who formed me from the womb to be His Servant,
c46009	to bring Jacob back to Him,
c46010	that Israel might be gathered to Him—
c46011	for I am honored in the sight of the LORD,
c46012	and my God is my strength—
c46013	He says,
c46014	“It is not enough
c46015	for you to be My Servant,
c46016	to raise up the tribes of Jacob,
c46017	and to restore the protected ones of Israel.
c46018	I will also make you a light for the nations,
c46019	that you may bring My salvation to the ends of the earth.”
c46020	Thus says the LORD,
c46021	the Redeemer [and] Holy One of Israel,
c46022	to him who was despised
c46023	[and] abhorred by the nation, to the servant of rulers:
c46024	“Kings will see you
c46025	and rise, and princes
c46026	will bow down, because of the LORD,
c46027	who is faithful,
c46028	the Holy One of Israel,
c46029	who has chosen you.”
c46030	This is what the LORD says:
c46031	“In the time of favor I will answer you,
c46032	and in the day of salvation I will help you;
c46033	I will keep you
c46034	and appoint you to be a covenant for the people,
c46035	to restore the land,
c46036	to apportion its desolate inheritances,
c46037	to say to the prisoners,
c46038	‘Come out,’
c46039	and to those in darkness,
c46040	‘Show yourselves.’
c46041	They will feed along the pathways,
c46042	and find pasture on every barren hill.
c46043	They will not hunger
c46044	or thirst,
c46045	nor will the scorching heat or sun strike them.
c46046	For He who has compassion on them will guide them
c46047	and lead them beside springs of water.
c46048	I will turn all My mountains into roads,
c46049	and My highways will be raised up.
c46050	Behold, they will come from far away,
c46051	from the north and from the west,
c46052	and from the land of Aswan.”
c46053	Shout for joy,
c46054	O heavens;
c46055	rejoice,
c46056	O earth;
c46057	break
c46058	O mountains!
c46059	into joyful song,
c46060	For the LORD has comforted His people,
c46061	and He will have compassion on His afflicted ones.
c46062	But Zion said,
c46063	“The LORD has forsaken me;
c46064	the Lord has forgotten me!”
c46065	“Can a woman forget her nursing child,
c46066	or lack compassion for the son of her womb?
c46067	Though she may forget,
c46068	I will not forget you!
c46069	Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands;
c46070	your walls are ever before Me.
c46071	Your builders hasten back;
c46072	those who laid you waste will depart.
c46073	Lift up your eyes ... around.
c46074	and look
c46075	They all gather together;
c46076	they come to you.
c46077	As surely as I live,
c46078	declares the LORD,
c46079	you will wear them all as jewelry
c46080	and put them on like a bride.
c46081	For your ruined and desolate places and your ravaged land
c46082	will now indeed be too small for your people,
c46083	and those who devoured you will be far away.
c46084	Yet the children of your bereavement will say in your hearing,
c46085	‘This place is too small for us;
c46086	make room
c46087	for us to live here.’
c46088	Then you will say in your heart,
c46089	‘Who has begotten these for me?
c46090	I was bereaved and barren;
c46091	I was exiled
c46092	and rejected.
c46094	So who has reared them?
c46095	Look, I was left all alone,
c46096	so
c46097	where did they come from?’”
c46098	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c46099	“Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations,
c46100	and raise My banner to the peoples.
c46101	They will bring your sons in their arms
c46102	and carry your daughters on their shoulders.
c46103	Kings will be your foster fathers,
c46104	and their queens your nursing mothers.
c46105	facedown
c46106	They will bow to you
c46107	and lick the dust at your feet.
c46108	Then you will know
c46109	that I am the LORD;
c46110	those who hope in Me will never be put to shame.”
c46111	Can the plunder be snatched from the mighty,
c46112	or the captives of a tyrant be delivered?
c46113	For this is what the LORD says:
c46114	“Even the captives of the mighty will be taken away,
c46115	and the plunder of a tyrant will be retrieved;
c46116	I will contend with those who contend with you,
c46117	and I will save your children.
c46118	I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh,
c46119	and they will be drunk on their own blood, as with sweet wine.
c46120	Then all mankind will know
c46121	that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
c46122	This is what the LORD says:
c46123	“Where is your mother’s certificate of divorce
c46124	with which I sent her away?
c46125	Or to which of My creditors
c46126	did I sell you?
c46127	Look, you were sold for your iniquities,
c46128	and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.
c46129	Why ... when I arrived?
c46130	was no one there
c46131	when I called?
c46132	Why did no one answer
c46133	Is My hand too short to redeem you?
c46134	Or do I lack the strength
c46135	to deliver you?
c46136	Behold, My rebuke dries up the sea;
c46137	I turn the rivers into a desert;
c46138	the fish rot for lack of water
c46139	and they die of thirst.
c46140	I clothe the heavens in black
c46141	and make sackcloth their covering.
c46142	The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of discipleship,
c46144	to sustain the weary with a word.
c46145	He awakens Me morning by morning;
c46146	He awakens My ear
c46147	to listen as a disciple.
c46148	The Lord GOD has opened My ears,
c46149	and I have not been rebellious,
c46150	nor have I turned back.
c46151	I offered My back to those who struck Me,
c46152	and My cheeks to those who tore out My beard.
c46153	I did not hide My face from scorn and spittle.
c46154	Because the Lord GOD helps Me,
c46155	I have not been disgraced;
c46156	therefore I have set My face like flint,
c46157	and I know
c46158	I will not be put to shame.
c46159	The One who vindicates Me is near.
c46160	Who will dare to contend with Me?
c46161	Let us confront each other!
c46162	Who has a case against Me?
c46163	Let him approach Me!
c46164	Surely the Lord GOD helps Me.
c46165	Who is there
c46166	to condemn Me?
c46167	See, they will all wear out like a garment;
c46168	the moths will devour them.
c46169	Who among you fears the LORD
c46170	[and] obeys the voice of His Servant?
c46171	Who among you walks in darkness
c46172	and has no light?
c46173	Let him trust in the name of the LORD;
c46174	let him lean on his God.
c46175	Behold, all
c46176	you who kindle a fire,
c46177	who array yourselves with firebrands,
c46178	walk in the light of your fire
c46179	and in the firebrands
c46180	you have lit!
c46181	This is what you will receive from My hand:
c46182	You will lie down in a place of torment.
c46183	Listen to Me,
c46184	you who pursue righteousness,
c46185	you who seek the LORD:
c46186	Look to the rock
c46187	from which you were cut,
c46188	and to the quarry
c46189	from which you were hewn.
c46190	Look to Abraham your father,
c46191	and to Sarah
c46192	who bore you.
c46193	When I called him, he was but one;
c46194	then I blessed him
c46195	and multiplied him.
c46196	For the LORD will comfort Zion
c46197	and look with compassion on all her ruins;
c46198	He will make her wilderness like Eden
c46199	and her desert like the garden of the LORD.
c46200	Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and melodious song.
c46201	Pay attention to Me,
c46202	My people,
c46204	My nation;
c46205	and listen to Me,
c46206	for a law will go out from Me,
c46207	and My justice [will become] a light to the nations; I will bring it about quickly.
c46208	My righteousness draws near,
c46209	My salvation is on the way,
c46210	and My arms will bring justice to the nations.
c46211	The islands will look for Me
c46212	and wait in hope for My arm.
c46213	Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
c46214	and look at the earth below;
c46215	for the heavens will vanish like smoke,
c46216	the earth will wear out like a garment,
c46217	and its people will die like [gnats].
c46218	But My salvation will last forever,
c46219	and My righteousness will never fail.
c46220	Listen to Me,
c46221	you who know what is right,
c46222	you people
c46223	with My law in your hearts:
c46224	Do not fear the scorn of men;
c46225	do not be broken by their insults.
c46226	For the moth will devour them like a garment,
c46227	and the worm will eat them like wool.
c46228	But My righteousness will last forever,
c46229	My salvation through all generations.
c46230	Awaken,
c46231	awaken,
c46232	put on strength,
c46233	O arm of the LORD.
c46234	Wake up as in days past, as in generations of long ago.
c46235	Was it not You
c46236	who cut Rahab to pieces,
c46237	who pierced through the dragon?
c46238	Was it not You
c46239	who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep,
c46240	who made a road in the depths of the sea
c46241	for the redeemed to cross over?
c46242	So the redeemed of the LORD will return
c46243	and enter Zion with singing,
c46244	crowned with unending joy.
c46245	Joy and gladness will overtake them,
c46246	and sorrow and sighing will flee.
c46247	I,
c46248	even I, am He
c46249	who comforts you.
c46250	Who are you
c46251	that you fear ... man,
c46252	mortal
c46253	or a son of man
c46254	who withers like grass?
c46255	But you have forgotten the LORD, your Maker,
c46256	who stretched out the heavens
c46257	and laid the foundations of the earth.
c46258	You live in terror all day long because of the fury of the oppressor,
c46259	who is bent
c46260	on destruction.
c46261	But where is the fury of the oppressor?
c46262	The captive will soon
c46263	be freed;
c46264	he will not die in the dungeon,
c46265	and his bread will not be lacking.
c46266	For I am the LORD your God
c46267	who stirs up the sea
c46268	so that its waves roar—
c46269	the LORD of Hosts [is] His name.
c46270	I have put My words in your mouth,
c46271	and covered you in the shadow of My hand,
c46272	to establish the heavens,
c46273	to found the earth,
c46274	and to say to Zion,
c46275	“You are My people.”
c46276	Awaken,
c46277	awaken!
c46278	Rise up,
c46279	O Jerusalem,
c46280	you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of His fury;
c46281	you who have drained the goblet ... the cup that makes men stagger.
c46282	to the dregs,
c46283	there is no
c46284	one to guide her;
c46285	Among all the sons
c46286	she bore,
c46287	there is no
c46288	one to take her hand.
c46289	among all the sons
c46290	she brought up,
c46291	These pairs have befallen you:
c46292	Who will grieve for you?
c46293	devastation and destruction, famine and sword.
c46294	Who can comfort you?
c46295	Your sons have fainted;
c46296	they lie at the head of every street, like an antelope in a net.
c46297	They are full of the wrath of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.
c46298	Therefore now hear this,
c46299	you afflicted one,
c46300	drunken,
c46301	but not with wine.
c46302	Thus says your Lord, the LORD, even your God,
c46303	who defends His people:
c46304	“See, I have removed the cup of staggering from your hand;
c46305	from that goblet, the cup of My fury,
c46306	you will never ... again.
c46307	drink
c46308	I will place it in the hands of your tormentors,
c46309	who told you:
c46310	‘Lie down,
c46311	so we can walk over you.’
c46312	And you made your back like the ground,
c46313	and like a street to be traversed.
c46314	Awaken,
c46315	awaken,
c46316	clothe yourself with strength,
c46317	O Zion!
c46318	Put on your garments of splendor,
c46319	O Jerusalem, Holy City!
c46320	For ... will not again
c46321	the uncircumcised and unclean ... enter you.
c46322	Shake off your dust!
c46323	Rise up
c46324	[and] sit [on your throne],
c46325	O Jerusalem.
c46326	Remove the chains from your neck,
c46327	O captive Daughter Zion.
c46328	For this is what the LORD says:
c46329	“You were sold for nothing,
c46330	and without money you will be redeemed.
c46331	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c46332	“At first My people went down to Egypt
c46333	to live,
c46334	then Assyria oppressed them without cause.
c46335	And now
c46336	what have I here?
c46337	declares the LORD.
c46338	For My people have been taken without cause;
c46339	those who rule them taunt,
c46340	declares the LORD,
c46341	and My name [is] blasphemed all day long.
c46342	Therefore My people will know My name;
c46343	therefore they will know on that day
c46344	that I am He
c46345	who speaks.
c46346	Here I am!”
c46347	How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news,
c46348	who proclaim peace,
c46349	who bring good tidings,
c46350	who proclaim salvation,
c46351	who say to Zion,
c46352	“Your God reigns!”
c46353	Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices,
c46354	together they shout for joy,
c46355	for every eye will see
c46356	when the LORD returns to Zion.
c46357	Break forth in joy,
c46358	sing together,
c46359	O ruins of Jerusalem,
c46360	for the LORD has comforted His people;
c46361	He has redeemed Jerusalem.
c46362	The LORD has bared His holy arm in the sight of all the nations;
c46363	all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
c46364	Depart,
c46365	depart,
c46366	go out from there!
c46367	Touch no unclean thing;
c46368	come out from it,
c46369	purify yourselves,
c46370	you who carry the vessels of the LORD.
c46371	For you will not leave in a hurry,
c46372	and you will not have to take flight;
c46373	for the LORD goes before you,
c46374	and the God of Israel is your rear guard.
c46375	Behold, My Servant will act wisely;
c46376	He will be raised
c46377	and lifted up
c46378	and highly exalted—
c46379	just as many were appalled at You—
c46380	His appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man,
c46381	and His form [was marred] beyond human likeness—
c46382	so He will sprinkle many nations.
c46383	Kings will shut their mouths because of Him.
c46384	For
c46385	what they have not been told,
c46386	they will see
c46388	what they have not heard.
c46389	and they will understand
c46390	Who has believed our message?
c46391	And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
c46392	He grew up before Him like a tender shoot,
c46393	and like a root out of dry ground.
c46394	He had no [stately] form
c46395	or majesty
c46396	to attract us,
c46397	no beauty
c46398	that we should desire Him.
c46399	He was despised
c46400	and rejected by men,
c46401	a man of sorrows,
c46402	acquainted with grief.
c46403	Like one from whom men hide their faces, He was despised,
c46404	and we esteemed Him not.
c46405	Surely He took on our infirmities
c46406	our sorrows;
c46407	and carried
c46408	yet we considered Him stricken by God, struck down and afflicted.
c46409	But He was pierced for our transgressions,
c46410	He was crushed for our iniquities;
c46411	the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him,
c46412	and by His stripes we are healed.
c46413	We all like sheep have gone astray,
c46414	each one ... to his own way;
c46415	has turned
c46416	and the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.
c46417	He was oppressed
c46418	and afflicted,
c46419	yet He did not open His mouth.
c46420	like a lamb
c46421	He was led ... to the slaughter,
c46422	and as a sheep
c46423	before her shearers is silent,
c46424	so He did not open His mouth.
c46425	By oppression and judgment He was taken away,
c46426	and who can recount His descendants?
c46427	For He was cut off from the land of the living;
c46428	He was stricken for the transgression of My people.
c46429	He was assigned a grave with the wicked,
c46430	and with a rich man in His death,
c46431	although He had done no violence,
c46432	nor was any deceit in His mouth.
c46433	Yet it was the LORD’s will
c46434	to crush Him
c46435	and cause Him to suffer.
c46436	And when His soul is made a guilt offering,
c46437	He will see [His] offspring,
c46438	He will prolong His days,
c46439	and the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand.
c46440	After the anguish of His soul, He will see the light of life
c46441	and be satisfied.
c46442	By His knowledge My righteous Servant will justify many,
c46443	and He will bear their iniquities.
c46444	Therefore I will allot Him a portion with the great,
c46445	and He will divide the spoils with the strong, ... among
c46446	because He has poured out His life unto death,
c46447	and He was numbered ... the transgressors.
c46448	Yet He bore the sin of many
c46449	and made intercession for the transgressors.
c46450	“Shout for joy,
c46451	O barren woman,
c46452	who bears no children;
c46453	break forth into song
c46454	and cry aloud,
c46455	you who have never travailed;
c46456	because more [are] the children of the desolate woman [than] of her who has a husband,”
c46457	says the LORD.
c46458	“Enlarge the site of your tent,
c46459	stretch out the curtains of your dwellings,
c46460	do not hold back.
c46461	Lengthen your ropes
c46462	and drive your stakes deep.
c46463	For you will spread out to the right and left;
c46464	your descendants will dispossess the nations
c46465	and inhabit the desolate cities.
c46466	Do not be afraid,
c46467	for you will not be put to shame;
c46468	do not be humiliated,
c46469	for you will not be disgraced.
c46470	For you will forget the shame of your youth,
c46471	and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood.
c46472	For your husband is your Maker—
c46473	the LORD of Hosts [is] His name—
c46474	the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer;
c46475	He is called the God of all the earth.
c46476	For the LORD has called you back, like a wife deserted and wounded in spirit,
c46477	the wife of one’s youth
c46478	when she is rejected,”
c46479	says your God.
c46480	For a brief moment I forsook you,
c46481	but with great compassion I will bring you back.
c46482	In a surge of anger I hid My face from you for a moment,
c46483	but with everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you,”
c46484	says the LORD your Redeemer.
c46485	“For to Me this is like the days of Noah,
c46486	when I swore
c46487	that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth.
c46488	So I have sworn
c46489	that I will not be angry with you
c46490	or rebuke you.
c46491	Though the mountains may be removed
c46492	and the hills may be shaken,
c46493	My loving devotion will not depart from you,
c46494	and My covenant of peace will not be broken,”
c46495	says the LORD, who has compassion on you.
c46496	“O afflicted city,
c46497	lashed by storms,
c46498	without solace,
c46499	surely I will set your stones in antimony
c46500	and lay your foundations with sapphires.
c46501	I will make your pinnacles of rubies,
c46502	your gates of sparkling jewels,
c46503	and all your walls of precious stones.
c46504	Then all your sons will be taught by the LORD,
c46505	and great [will be their] prosperity.
c46506	In righteousness you will be established,
c46507	far from oppression,
c46508	for you will have no fear,
c46509	and [removed] from terror,
c46510	for it will not come near you.
c46511	If anyone attacks you,
c46512	it is not from Me;
c46513	whoever assails you
c46514	will fall before you.
c46515	Behold, I have created the craftsman
c46516	who fans the coals into flame
c46517	and forges a weapon fit for its task;
c46518	and I have created the destroyer
c46519	to wreak havoc.
c46520	weapon
c46521	formed against you
c46522	No ... shall prosper,
c46523	every tongue
c46524	that accuses you.
c46525	and you will refute
c46526	This is the heritage of the LORD’s servants, and their vindication [is] from Me,”
c46527	declares the LORD.
c46528	“Come,
c46529	all of you who thirst,
c46530	come to the waters;
c46532	and you without money,
c46533	come,
c46534	buy,
c46535	and eat!
c46536	Come,
c46537	buy wine and milk, without money and without cost!
c46538	Why spend money on that which is not bread,
c46539	and your labor
c46540	on that which does not satisfy?
c46541	Listen carefully to Me,
c46542	and eat what is good,
c46543	and your soul will delight in the richest of foods.
c46544	Incline your ear
c46545	and come to Me;
c46546	listen,
c46547	so that your soul may live.
c46548	I will make an everlasting covenant with you, my loving devotion assured to David.
c46549	Behold, I have made him a witness to the nations, a leader and commander of the peoples.
c46550	Surely ... a nation
c46551	you do not know,
c46552	you will summon
c46553	and nations
c46554	who do not know you
c46555	will run to you. ... the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel,
c46556	For ... has bestowed glory on you.”
c46557	Seek the LORD
c46558	while He may be found;
c46559	call on Him
c46560	while He is near.
c46561	Let the wicked man forsake his own way
c46562	and the unrighteous man his own thoughts;
c46563	let him return to the LORD,
c46564	that He may have compassion,
c46565	and to our God,
c46566	for He will freely
c46567	pardon.
c46568	“For My thoughts are not your thoughts,
c46569	neither are your ways My ways,”
c46570	declares the LORD.
c46571	“For [as] the heavens are higher than the earth,
c46572	so My ways are higher than your ways
c46573	and My thoughts than your thoughts.
c46574	For
c46575	just as rain and snow fall from heaven
c46576	and do not return
c46577	without watering the earth,
c46578	making it bud
c46579	and sprout,
c46580	and providing seed to sow
c46581	and food to eat,
c46582	so My word
c46583	that proceeds from My mouth
c46584	will not return to Me empty,
c46585	but it will accomplish
c46586	what I please,
c46587	and it will prosper
c46588	where I send it.
c46589	You will indeed go out with joy
c46590	and be led forth in peace;
c46591	the mountains and hills will burst into song before you,
c46592	and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
c46593	Instead of the thornbush, a cypress will grow,
c46594	and instead of the brier, a myrtle will spring up;
c46595	they will make a name for the LORD as an everlasting sign,
c46596	never to be destroyed.”
c46597	This is what the LORD says:
c46598	“Maintain justice
c46599	and do what is right,
c46600	for My salvation ... soon,
c46601	is coming
c46602	and My righteousness
c46603	will be revealed.
c46604	Blessed is the man
c46605	who does this,
c46606	and the son of man
c46607	who holds it fast,
c46608	who keeps the Sabbath
c46609	without profaning it,
c46610	and keeps his hand
c46611	from doing any evil.”
c46612	Let no foreigner ... say,
c46613	who has joined himself to the LORD
c46614	say,
c46615	“The LORD will utterly exclude me from His people.”
c46616	And let the eunuch not
c46617	“I am but a dry tree.”
c46618	For this is what the LORD says: “To the eunuchs
c46619	who keep My Sabbaths,
c46620	who choose
c46621	what pleases Me
c46622	and hold fast to My covenant—
c46623	I will give them, in My house and within My walls, a memorial and a name
c46624	better than that of sons and daughters.
c46625	I will give them an everlasting name
c46626	that will not be cut off.
c46627	And the foreigners
c46628	who join themselves to the LORD
c46629	to minister to Him,
c46630	to love the name of the LORD,
c46631	and to be His servants—
c46632	all
c46633	who keep the Sabbath
c46634	without profaning it
c46635	and who hold fast to My covenant—
c46636	I will bring them to My holy mountain
c46637	and make them joyful in My house of prayer.
c46638	Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on My altar,
c46639	for My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations.”
c46640	Thus declares the Lord GOD,
c46641	who gathers the dispersed of Israel:
c46642	“I will gather to them still others besides those already gathered.”
c46643	all you beasts of the field,
c46644	Come,
c46645	eat greedily,
c46646	all you beasts of the forest.
c46647	Israel’s watchmen are blind,
c46648	they are all oblivious;
c46649	they are all mute dogs,
c46650	they cannot
c46651	bark;
c46652	they are dreamers
c46653	lying around,
c46654	loving
c46655	to slumber.
c46656	Like ravenous dogs,
c46657	they are never satisfied.
c46658	They are shepherds
c46659	with no
c46660	discernment;
c46661	they all turn to their own way,
c46662	each one seeking his own gain:
c46663	“Come,
c46664	let me get the wine,
c46665	let us imbibe the strong drink,
c46666	and tomorrow will be like today,
c46667	only far better!”
c46668	The righteous perish,
c46669	and no one
c46670	takes it to heart;
c46671	devout men are swept away,
c46672	with none considering
c46673	that the righteous are guided from the presence of evil.
c46674	enter into peace;
c46675	they find rest, lying down in death.
c46676	Those who walk uprightly
c46677	But come here, you
c46678	sons of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers
c46679	and prostitutes!
c46680	Whom are you mocking?
c46681	At whom do you snarl
c46682	and stick out your tongue?
c46683	Are you not children of transgression, offspring of deceit,
c46684	who burn with lust among the oaks, under every luxuriant tree,
c46685	who slaughter your children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
c46686	Among the smooth [stones] of the valley [is] your portion;
c46687	indeed, they
c46688	are your lot.
c46689	Even to them you have poured out a drink offering,
c46690	you have offered a grain offering.
c46691	Should I relent because of these?
c46692	On a high and lofty hill you have made your bed,
c46693	and there you went up
c46694	to offer sacrifices.
c46695	Behind the door and doorpost you have set up your memorial.
c46696	Forsaking me, you uncovered
c46697	you climbed up
c46698	your bed; ... and opened it wide.
c46699	And you have made a pact with those
c46700	whose bed you have loved;
c46701	you have gazed upon their nakedness.
c46702	You went to [Molech] with oil
c46703	and multiplied your perfumes.
c46704	You have sent your envoys a great distance; ... even to
c46705	you have descended ... Sheol itself.
c46706	You are wearied by your many journeys,
c46707	but you did not say,
c46708	“There is no hope!”
c46709	You found renewal of your strength;
c46710	therefore you did not grow weak.
c46711	Whom have you dreaded
c46712	and feared,
c46713	so that you lied
c46714	and failed to remember Me
c46715	or take this to heart? ... not
c46716	Have I ... held My peace ... do not
c46717	such a long time,
c46718	and still you ... fear Me?
c46719	I will expose your righteousness
c46720	and your works,
c46721	and they will not profit you.
c46722	When you cry out,
c46723	let your companies [of idols] deliver you!
c46724	Yet the wind will carry off all of them,
c46725	a breath will take them away.
c46727	But he who seeks refuge in Me
c46728	will inherit the land
c46729	and possess My holy mountain.”
c46730	And it will be said,
c46731	“Build it up,
c46732	build it up,
c46733	prepare the way,
c46734	take every obstacle out of the way of My people.”
c46735	For thus says the One who is high and lifted up,
c46736	who inhabits eternity,
c46737	whose name is Holy:
c46738	“I dwell in a high and holy place,
c46739	and with the oppressed and humble of spirit,
c46740	to restore the spirit of the lowly
c46741	and revive the heart of the contrite.
c46742	For I will not accuse you forever,
c46743	nor will I always be angry;
c46744	for then the spirit [of man] would grow weak before Me,
c46745	with the breath
c46746	of those I have made.
c46747	I was enraged by his sinful greed,
c46748	so I struck him
c46749	and hid [My face]
c46750	in anger;
c46751	yet he kept turning back to the desires of his heart.
c46752	I have seen his ways,
c46753	but I will heal him;
c46754	I will guide him
c46755	and restore comfort to him and his mourners,
c46756	bringing praise to their lips.
c46757	“Peace, peace to those far and near,”
c46758	says the LORD,
c46759	“and I will heal them.”
c46760	But the wicked ... sea,
c46761	are like the storm-tossed
c46762	for
c46763	be still,
c46764	it cannot
c46765	and its waves churn up mire and muck.
c46766	“There is no peace,”
c46767	says my God,
c46768	“for the wicked.”
c46769	“Cry aloud,
c46770	do not hold back!
c46771	Raise your voice like a trumpet.
c46772	Declare to My people their transgression
c46773	and to the house of Jacob their sins.
c46774	For day after day they seek Me
c46775	and delight to know My ways, like a nation
c46776	that does what is right
c46777	and does not forsake the justice of their God.
c46778	They ask Me for righteous judgments;
c46779	they delight in the nearness of God.”
c46780	“Why have we fasted,
c46781	and You have not seen?
c46782	[Why] have we humbled ourselves,
c46783	and You have not noticed?”
c46784	“Behold, on the day of your fast, you do as you please,
c46785	and you oppress all your workers.
c46786	You fast with contention and strife
c46787	to strike viciously with your fist.
c46788	You cannot fast as you do today
c46789	and have your voice be heard on high.
c46790	Is this the fast
c46791	I have chosen,
c46792	a day
c46793	for a man to deny himself,
c46794	to bow his head like a reed,
c46795	and to spread out sackcloth and ashes?
c46796	Will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the LORD?
c46797	Is not the fast
c46798	I have chosen
c46799	to break the chains of wickedness,
c46800	to untie the cords of the yoke,
c46801	to set the oppressed free,
c46802	and tear off every yoke?
c46803	Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,
c46804	to bring the poor and homeless into your home,
c46805	the naked when you see him,
c46806	to clothe
c46807	and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?
c46808	Then your light will break forth like the dawn,
c46809	and your healing will come quickly.
c46810	Your righteousness will go before you,
c46811	and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard.
c46812	Then you will call,
c46813	and the LORD will answer;
c46814	you will cry out,
c46815	and He will say,
c46816	‘Here I am.’
c46817	If you remove the yoke from your midst,
c46818	the pointing of the finger
c46819	and malicious talk,
c46820	and if you give yourself to the hungry
c46821	and satisfy the afflicted soul,
c46822	then your light will go forth in the darkness,
c46823	and your night will be like noonday.
c46824	The LORD will always guide you;
c46825	He will satisfy you in a sun-scorched land
c46826	and strengthen your frame.
c46827	You will be like a well-watered garden,
c46828	like a spring
c46829	whose waters never fail.
c46830	Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins;
c46831	you will restore the age-old foundations;
c46832	you will be called
c46833	Repairer of the Breach,
c46834	Restorer of Streets
c46835	of Dwelling.
c46836	If you turn your foot from [breaking] the Sabbath,
c46837	from doing as you please on My holy day,
c46838	if you call the Sabbath a delight,
c46839	and the LORD’s holy [day] honorable,
c46840	if you honor it
c46841	by not going your own way
c46842	or seeking your own pleasure
c46843	or speaking idle words,
c46844	then you will delight yourself in the LORD,
c46845	and I will make you ride on the heights of the land
c46846	and feed you with the heritage of your father Jacob.”
c46847	For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
c46848	Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short
c46849	to save,
c46850	nor His ear too dull
c46851	to hear.
c46852	But your iniquities have built barriers between you and your God,
c46853	and your sins have hidden [His] face
c46854	from you, so that He will not hear.
c46855	For your hands are stained with blood,
c46856	and your fingers with iniquity;
c46857	your lips have spoken lies,
c46858	and your tongue mutters injustice.
c46859	No one calls for justice;
c46860	no one pleads his case honestly.
c46861	They rely on empty [pleas];
c46862	they tell lies;
c46863	they conceive mischief
c46864	and give birth to iniquity.
c46865	They hatch the eggs of vipers
c46866	and weave a spider’s web.
c46867	Whoever eats their eggs
c46868	will die;
c46870	crack one open,
c46871	and a viper is hatched.
c46872	Their cobwebs cannot be made into clothing,
c46873	and they cannot cover themselves with their works.
c46874	Their deeds are sinful deeds,
c46875	and acts of violence are in their hands.
c46876	Their feet run to evil;
c46877	they are swift
c46878	to shed innocent blood.
c46879	Their thoughts are sinful thoughts;
c46880	ruin and destruction lie in their wake.
c46881	The way of peace they have not known,
c46882	and there is no justice in their tracks.
c46883	They have turned them into crooked paths;
c46884	no one
c46885	who treads on them
c46886	will know peace.
c46887	Therefore justice is far from us,
c46888	and righteousness does not reach us.
c46889	We hope for light,
c46890	but there is darkness,
c46891	for brightness,
c46892	[but] we walk in gloom.
c46893	Like the blind, we feel our way along the wall,
c46894	groping like those without eyes.
c46895	We stumble at midday as in the twilight;
c46896	among the vigorous we are like the dead.
c46897	We all growl like bears
c46898	and moan like doves.
c46899	We hope for justice,
c46900	but [find] none,
c46901	for salvation,
c46902	but it is far from us.
c46903	For our transgressions are multiplied before You,
c46904	and our sins testify against us.
c46905	Our transgressions are indeed with us,
c46906	our iniquities:
c46907	and we know
c46908	rebelling
c46909	and denying the LORD,
c46910	turning away from our God,
c46911	speaking oppression and revolt,
c46912	conceiving
c46913	and uttering lies from the heart.
c46914	So justice is turned away,
c46915	and righteousness stands at a distance.
c46916	For truth has stumbled in the public square,
c46917	and honesty cannot
c46918	enter.
c46919	Truth is missing,
c46921	and whoever turns from evil
c46922	makes himself prey.
c46923	The LORD looked
c46924	and was offended
c46925	that there was no justice.
c46926	He saw
c46927	that there was no man—
c46928	He was amazed
c46929	that there was no one to intercede;
c46930	so His own arm brought salvation,
c46931	and His own righteousness
c46932	sustained Him.
c46933	He put on righteousness like a breastplate,
c46934	and the helmet of salvation on His head;
c46935	He put on garments of vengeance
c46936	and wrapped Himself in a cloak of zeal.
c46937	So He will repay according to their deeds:
c46938	fury to His enemies,
c46939	retribution to His foes,
c46940	and recompense to the islands.
c46941	So will they fear the name of the LORD from the west
c46942	and His glory from the rising of the sun;
c46943	for He will come like a rushing stream,
c46944	driven by the wind of the LORD.
c46945	“The Redeemer will come to Zion,
c46946	to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,”
c46947	declares the LORD.
c46948	“As for Me,
c46949	this is My covenant with them,”
c46950	says the LORD.
c46951	“My Spirit
c46952	who is on you,
c46953	and My words
c46954	that I have put in your mouth,
c46955	will not depart from your mouth, from the mouths of your children, or from the mouths of your children’s children,
c46956	says the LORD.
c46957	from now on and forevermore,”
c46958	Arise,
c46959	shine,
c46960	for your light has come,
c46961	and the glory of the LORD rises upon you.
c46962	For behold, darkness covers the earth,
c46963	and thick darkness [is over] the peoples;
c46964	but the LORD will rise upon you,
c46965	and His glory will appear over you.
c46966	Nations will come to your light,
c46967	and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
c46968	Lift up your eyes ... around:
c46969	and look
c46970	They all gather
c46971	and come to you;
c46972	your sons will come from afar,
c46973	and your daughters will be carried on the arm.
c46974	Then you will look
c46975	and be radiant,
c46976	will tremble
c46977	and your heart ... and rejoice,
c46978	because the riches of the sea will be brought to you,
c46979	and the wealth of the nations will come to you.
c46980	Caravans of camels will cover your land, young camels of Midian and Ephah,
c46981	[and] all from Sheba will come,
c46982	bearing gold and frankincense
c46983	and proclaiming the praises of the LORD.
c46984	All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you;
c46985	the rams of Nebaioth will serve you
c46986	and go up on My altar with acceptance;
c46987	I will adorn My glorious house.
c46988	Who are these
c46989	who fly like clouds,
c46990	like doves to their shelters?
c46991	Surely the islands will wait for Me,
c46992	with the ships of Tarshish in the lead,
c46993	to bring your children from afar,
c46994	with their silver and gold, to the honor of the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel,
c46995	for He has bestowed glory on you.
c46996	Foreigners will rebuild your walls,
c46997	and their kings will serve you.
c46998	Although I struck you in anger,
c46999	yet in favor I will show you mercy.
c47000	Your gates will always stand open;
c47001	they will never be shut, day or night,
c47002	so that the wealth of the nations may be brought into you,
c47003	with their kings being led in procession.
c47004	For the nation or kingdom
c47005	that will not serve you
c47006	will perish;
c47007	[it] will be utterly destroyed.
c47008	The glory of Lebanon will come to you— its pine, fir, and cypress together—
c47009	to adorn the place of My sanctuary,
c47010	and I will glorify the place of My feet.
c47011	will come ... to you;
c47012	and bow down
c47013	The sons of your oppressors
c47014	all who reviled you will fall facedown at your feet
c47015	and call you the City of the LORD, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
c47016	Whereas you have been forsaken and despised,
c47017	with no one passing through,
c47018	I will make you an everlasting pride,
c47019	a joy from age to age.
c47020	You will drink the milk of nations
c47021	and nurse at the breasts of royalty;
c47022	you will know
c47023	that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
c47024	Instead of bronze I will bring you gold;
c47025	I will bring silver in place of iron,
c47026	bronze instead of wood,
c47027	and iron instead of stones.
c47028	I will appoint peace as your governor
c47029	and righteousness as your ruler.
c47030	No longer {will} violence be heard in your land,
c47031	nor ruin or destruction within your borders.
c47032	But you will name your walls Salvation
c47033	and your gates Praise.
c47034	No longer will the sun be your light by day,
c47035	and the brightness of the moon will not shine on you;
c47036	for the LORD will be your everlasting light,
c47037	and your God will be your splendor.
c47038	Your sun will no longer set,
c47039	and your moon will not wane;
c47040	for the LORD will be your everlasting light,
c47041	and the days of your sorrow will be over.
c47042	your people
c47043	Then all ... will be righteous;
c47044	they will possess the land forever;
c47045	they are the branch of My planting, the work of My hands,
c47046	so that I may be glorified.
c47047	The least [of you] will become a thousand,
c47048	and the smallest a mighty nation.
c47049	I am the LORD; in its time I will accomplish it quickly.
c47050	The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on Me,
c47051	because the LORD has anointed Me
c47052	to preach good news to the poor.
c47053	He has sent Me
c47054	to bind up the brokenhearted,
c47055	to proclaim liberty to the captives
c47056	and release from darkness to the prisoners,
c47057	to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor
c47058	and the day of our God’s vengeance,
c47059	to comfort all who mourn,
c47060	to provide for those who grieve in Zion—
c47061	to give them a crown of beauty for ashes,
c47062	the oil of joy for mourning,
c47063	and a garment of praise in place of a spirit of despair.
c47064	So they will be called
c47065	oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD,
c47066	that He may be glorified.
c47067	They will rebuild the ancient ruins;
c47068	they will restore the places long devastated;
c47069	they will renew the ruined cities,
c47070	the desolations of many generations.
c47071	Strangers will stand
c47072	and feed your flocks,
c47073	and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers.
c47074	But you will be called the priests of the LORD;
c47075	of you as ministers of our God;
c47076	they will speak
c47077	you will feed on the wealth of the nations,
c47078	and you will boast in their riches.
c47079	Instead of shame, [My people will have a] double portion,
c47080	and [instead of] humiliation, they will rejoice in their share;
c47081	and so they will inherit a double portion in their land,
c47082	and everlasting joy will be theirs.
c47083	For I, the LORD, love justice;
c47084	I hate robbery and iniquity;
c47085	in My faithfulness I will give them their recompense
c47086	and make an everlasting covenant with them.
c47087	Their descendants will be known among the nations,
c47088	and their offspring among the peoples.
c47089	All who see them will acknowledge
c47090	that they are a people
c47091	the LORD has blessed.
c47092	I will rejoice greatly in the LORD,
c47093	my soul will exult in my God;
c47094	for He has clothed me with garments of salvation
c47095	and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness, as a groom
c47096	wears a priestly headdress,
c47097	and as a bride
c47098	adorns herself with her jewels.
c47099	For as the earth
c47100	brings forth its growth,
c47101	and as a garden
c47102	enables seed to spring up,
c47103	so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.
c47104	For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent,
c47105	and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep still,
c47106	until her righteousness shines like a bright light,
c47107	her salvation ... torch.
c47108	like a blazing
c47109	Nations will see your righteousness,
c47110	and all kings your glory.
c47111	You will be called by a new name
c47112	that the mouth of the LORD will bestow.
c47113	You will be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD,
c47114	a royal diadem in the palm of your God.
c47115	No longer will you be called Forsaken,
c47116	nor your land named Desolate;
c47117	but you will be called
c47118	Hephzibah,
c47119	and your land Beulah;
c47120	for the LORD will take delight in you,
c47121	and your land will be His bride.
c47122	For as a young man marries a young woman,
c47123	so your sons will marry you;
c47124	and as a groom rejoices over his bride,
c47125	so your God will rejoice over you.
c47126	On your walls,
c47127	O Jerusalem,
c47128	I have posted watchmen;
c47129	they will never be silent day or night.
c47130	You who call on the LORD
c47131	shall take no rest for yourselves,
c47132	nor give Him any rest
c47133	until He establishes
c47134	Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.
c47135	The LORD has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm:
c47136	“Never again will I give your grain to your enemies for food,
c47137	nor will foreigners drink the new wine
c47138	for which you have toiled.
c47139	For
c47140	those who harvest [grain]
c47141	will eat it
c47142	and praise the LORD,
c47144	and those who gather [grapes]
c47145	will drink the wine in My holy courts.”
c47146	Go out,
c47147	go out through the gates;
c47148	prepare the way for the people!
c47149	Build it up,
c47150	build up the highway;
c47151	clear away the stones!
c47152	Raise a banner for the nations [to see].
c47153	Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the ends of the earth,
c47154	“Say to Daughter Zion:
c47155	See, your Savior comes!
c47156	Look, His reward is with Him,
c47157	and His recompense goes before Him.”
c47158	And they will be called
c47159	the Holy People, the Redeemed of The LORD;
c47160	and you will be called
c47161	Sought Out, A City
c47162	Not Forsaken.
c47163	Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah with crimson-stained garments?
c47164	Who is this
c47165	robed in splendor,
c47166	marching in the greatness of His strength?
c47167	“It is I
c47168	who speak in righteousness,
c47169	mighty
c47170	to save.”
c47171	Why are Your clothes red,
c47172	and Your garments
c47173	like one who treads the winepress?
c47174	“I have trodden the winepress alone,
c47175	and no one from the nations was with Me.
c47176	I trampled them in My anger
c47177	and trod them underfoot in My fury;
c47178	their blood spattered My garments,
c47179	and all My clothes were stained.
c47180	For the day of vengeance was in My heart,
c47181	and the year of My redemption had come.
c47182	I looked,
c47183	but there was no one to help;
c47184	I was appalled
c47185	that no one assisted;
c47186	so My arm brought Me salvation,
c47187	and My own wrath
c47188	upheld Me.
c47189	I trampled nations in My anger;
c47190	in My wrath I made them drunk
c47191	and poured out their blood on the ground.”
c47192	I will make known the LORD’s loving devotion
c47193	and [His] praiseworthy acts, because of all
c47194	the LORD has done for us—
c47195	even the many good things He has done for the house of Israel
c47196	according to His compassion and the abundance of His loving devotion.
c47197	For He said,
c47198	“They are surely My people,
c47199	sons
c47200	who will not be disloyal”;
c47201	and so He became their Savior.
c47202	In all their distress, He too was afflicted,
c47203	and the Angel of His Presence saved them.
c47204	In His love and compassion He redeemed them;
c47205	He lifted them up
c47206	and carried them all the days of old.
c47207	But they rebelled
c47208	and grieved His Holy Spirit.
c47209	So He turned [and became] their enemy
c47210	[and] He Himself fought against them.
c47211	Then His people remembered the days of old, the days of Moses.
c47212	Where
c47213	is He who brought them through the sea with the shepherds of His flock?
c47214	Where
c47215	is the One who set His Holy Spirit among them,
c47216	who sent His glorious arm [to lead them] by the right hand of Moses,
c47217	who divided the waters before them
c47218	to gain for Himself everlasting renown,
c47219	who led them through the depths
c47220	like a horse in the wilderness, so that they did not stumble?
c47221	Like cattle
c47222	going down to the valley,
c47223	the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest.
c47224	You led Your people this way
c47225	to make for Yourself a glorious name.
c47226	Look down from heaven
c47227	and see, from Your holy and glorious habitation.
c47228	Where are Your zeal and might?
c47229	Your yearning and compassion for me are restrained.
c47230	Yet You are our Father,
c47231	though Abraham does not know us
c47232	and Israel does not acknowledge us.
c47233	You, O LORD, are our Father;
c47234	our Redeemer from of old is Your name.
c47235	Why, ... do You make us stray
c47236	O LORD,
c47237	from Your ways
c47238	[and] harden our hearts from fearing You?
c47239	Return, for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your heritage.
c47240	For a short while Your people possessed Your holy place,
c47241	but our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary.
c47242	We have become like those You never
c47243	ruled,
c47244	like those not called by Your name.
c47245	If only You would rend the heavens
c47246	and come down,
c47247	so that mountains would quake at Your presence,
c47248	as fire kindles the brushwood
c47249	[and] causes the water to boil,
c47250	to make Your name known to Your enemies,
c47251	so that nations will tremble at Your presence!
c47252	When You did awesome works
c47253	that we did not expect,
c47254	You came down,
c47255	and the mountains trembled at Your presence.
c47256	From ancient times no one has heard,
c47257	no ear has perceived,
c47258	no eye has seen any God but You,
c47259	who acts
c47260	on behalf of those who wait for Him.
c47261	You welcome those who gladly do right,
c47262	who remember Your ways.
c47263	Surely You were angry,
c47264	for we sinned. ... if we remain in our sins?
c47265	How can we be saved
c47266	All of us have become like one who is unclean,
c47267	and all our righteous acts are like a polluted garment;
c47268	we all wither like a leaf,
c47269	and our iniquities carry us away like the wind.
c47270	No one calls on Your name
c47271	[or] strives
c47272	to take hold of You.
c47273	For You have hidden Your face from us
c47274	and made us melt in the hand of our iniquity.
c47275	But now,
c47276	O LORD,
c47277	You are our Father;
c47278	we are the clay,
c47279	and You are the potter;
c47280	we are all the work of Your hand.
c47281	Do not be angry,
c47282	O LORD,
c47283	beyond measure;
c47284	do not remember our iniquity forever.
c47285	Oh, look upon us, we pray;
c47286	we are all Your people!
c47287	Your holy cities have become a wilderness;
c47288	Zion has become a wasteland,
c47289	Jerusalem a desolation.
c47290	Our holy and beautiful temple,
c47291	where our fathers praised You,
c47292	has been burned with fire,
c47293	and all that was dear to us lies in ruins.
c47294	After all this, ... will You restrain Yourself?
c47295	O LORD,
c47296	Will You keep silent
c47297	and afflict us beyond measure?
c47298	I revealed Myself
c47299	to those who did not ask for Me;
c47300	I was found
c47301	by those who did not seek Me.
c47302	I said:
c47303	“Here I am!
c47304	Here I am!”
c47305	to a nation
c47306	that did not call My name.
c47307	All day long I have held out My hands to an obstinate people,
c47308	who walk ... path,
c47309	in the wrong
c47310	who follow their own imaginations,
c47311	to a people
c47312	who continually provoke Me to My face,
c47313	sacrificing in the gardens
c47314	and burning incense on altars of brick,
c47315	sitting among the graves,
c47316	spending nights in secret places,
c47317	eating the meat of pigs
c47318	and polluted broth from their bowls.
c47319	They say,
c47320	‘Keep to yourself,
c47321	do not come near me,
c47322	for I am holier than you!’
c47323	Such people are smoke in My nostrils,
c47324	a fire
c47325	that burns all day long.
c47326	Behold, it is written before Me:
c47327	I will not keep silent,
c47328	but I will repay;
c47329	I will pay it back into their laps
c47330	both for your iniquities and [those] of your fathers,”
c47331	says the LORD.
c47332	“Because they burned incense on the mountains
c47333	and scorned Me on the hills,
c47334	I will measure into their laps full payment for their former deeds.”
c47335	This is what the LORD says:
c47336	“As the new wine is found in a cluster of grapes,
c47337	and men say,
c47338	‘Do not destroy it,
c47339	for it contains a blessing,’
c47340	so I will act on behalf of My servants:
c47341	I will not destroy them all.
c47342	And I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,
c47343	and heirs to My mountains out of Judah;
c47344	My elect will possess it,
c47345	and My servants will dwell there.
c47346	Sharon will become a pasture for flocks,
c47347	and the Valley of Achor a resting place for the herds, for My people
c47348	who seek Me.
c47349	But you
c47350	who forsake the LORD,
c47351	who forget My holy mountain,
c47352	who set a table for Fortune
c47353	and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
c47354	I will destine you for the sword,
c47355	and you will all kneel down to be slaughtered,
c47356	because I called
c47357	and you did not answer,
c47358	I spoke
c47359	and you did not listen;
c47360	you did evil in My sight
c47362	that in which I did not delight.”
c47363	and chose
c47364	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
c47365	“My servants will eat,
c47366	but you will go hungry;
c47367	My servants will drink,
c47368	but you will go thirsty;
c47369	My servants will rejoice,
c47370	but you will be put to shame.
c47371	My servants will shout for joy with a glad heart,
c47372	but you will cry out with a heavy heart
c47373	and wail with a broken spirit.
c47374	You will leave behind your name as a curse for My chosen ones,
c47375	and the Lord GOD will slay you,
c47376	but to His servants He will give another name.
c47377	Whoever
c47378	invokes a blessing in the land
c47379	will [do so] by the God of truth,
c47381	and whoever takes an oath in the land
c47382	will swear by the God of truth.
c47383	For the former troubles will be forgotten
c47384	and hidden from My sight.
c47385	For behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth.
c47386	The former things will not be remembered,
c47387	nor will they come to mind.
c47388	But be glad
c47389	and rejoice forever
c47390	in what I create;
c47391	for I will create Jerusalem to be a joy
c47392	and its people to be a delight.
c47393	I will rejoice in Jerusalem
c47394	and take delight in My people.
c47395	The sounds of weeping and crying will no longer be heard in her.
c47396	No longer will a nursing infant live but a few days, or an old man
c47397	not live out his days.
c47398	For the youth will die at a hundred years,
c47399	and he who fails [to reach] a hundred will be considered accursed.
c47400	They will build houses
c47401	and dwell in them;
c47402	they will plant vineyards
c47403	and eat their fruit.
c47404	No longer will they build houses
c47405	for others to inhabit,
c47406	nor plant
c47407	for others to eat.
c47408	For [as is] the lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people,
c47409	and My chosen ones will fully enjoy the work of their hands.
c47410	They will not labor in vain
c47411	[or] bear children doomed to disaster;
c47412	for they will be a people blessed by the LORD—
c47413	[they] and their descendants with them.
c47415	Even before they call,
c47416	I will answer,
c47417	and while they are still speaking,
c47418	I will hear.
c47419	The wolf and the lamb will feed together,
c47420	and the lion will eat straw like the ox,
c47421	of the serpent
c47422	but the food ... will be dust.
c47423	They will do no harm
c47424	nor destruction on all My holy mountain,”
c47425	says the LORD.
c47426	This is what the LORD says:
c47427	“Heaven is My throne,
c47428	and earth is My footstool.
c47429	What kind of house
c47430	will you build for Me?
c47431	Or where [will be] My place of repose?
c47432	[Has not] My hand made ... these things?
c47433	all ... And so they came into being,
c47434	declares the LORD.
c47435	This is the one I will esteem:
c47436	he who is humble and contrite in spirit, who trembles at My word.
c47437	Whoever slaughters an ox
c47438	is [like] one who slays a man;
c47439	whoever sacrifices a lamb
c47440	[is like] one who breaks a dog’s neck;
c47441	whoever presents a grain offering
c47442	pig’s blood;
c47443	[is like] one who offers ... whoever offers incense
c47444	[is like] one who praises an idol.
c47445	Indeed, they have chosen their own ways
c47446	and delighted in their abominations.
c47447	So I will choose their punishment
c47448	and I will bring terror upon them,
c47449	because I called
c47450	and no one answered,
c47451	I spoke
c47452	and no one listened.
c47453	But they did what was evil in My sight
c47455	that in which I did not delight.”
c47456	and chose
c47457	hear the word of the LORD:
c47458	You who tremble at His word,
c47459	“Your brothers ... have said,
c47460	who hate
c47461	and exclude you because of My name
c47462	‘Let the LORD be glorified
c47463	that we may see your joy!’
c47464	But they will be put to shame.”
c47465	Hear the uproar from the city;
c47466	[listen to] the voice from the temple!
c47467	[It is] the voice of the LORD,
c47468	repaying His enemies what they deserve!
c47469	Before she was in labor,
c47470	she gave birth;
c47471	before she was in pain,
c47472	she delivered a boy.
c47473	Who has heard of such as this?
c47474	Who has seen such things?
c47475	Can a country be born in a day
c47476	or a nation be delivered in an instant?
c47477	Yet ... was in labor,
c47478	as soon as Zion ... she gave birth to her children.
c47479	Shall I bring a baby to the point of birth
c47480	and not deliver it?”
c47481	says the LORD.
c47482	“Or will I who deliver
c47483	close the womb?”
c47484	says your God.
c47485	Be glad for Jerusalem
c47486	and rejoice over her,
c47487	all who love her.
c47488	Rejoice greatly with her,
c47489	all
c47490	who mourn over her,
c47491	so that you may nurse
c47492	and be satisfied at her comforting breasts;
c47493	you may drink deeply
c47494	and delight yourselves in her glorious abundance.
c47495	For this is what the LORD says:
c47496	I will extend peace to her like a river,
c47497	and the wealth of nations like a flowing stream;
c47498	you will nurse
c47499	and be carried on her arm,
c47500	and bounced upon [her] knees.
c47502	As a mother comforts her son,
c47503	so I will comfort you,
c47504	and you will be consoled over Jerusalem.
c47505	When you see,
c47506	you will rejoice,
c47507	and you will flourish like grass;
c47508	then the hand of the LORD will be revealed to His servants,
c47509	but His wrath will be shown to His enemies.
c47510	For behold, the LORD will come with fire—
c47511	His chariots are like the whirlwind—
c47512	to execute His anger with fury
c47513	and His rebuke with flames of fire.
c47514	For by fire ... the LORD will execute judgment
c47515	and by His sword, ... on all flesh,
c47516	and many will be slain by the LORD.
c47517	“Those who dedicate
c47518	and purify themselves to enter the groves— to follow one in the midst
c47519	of those who eat the flesh of swine and vermin and rats—
c47520	will perish together,”
c47521	declares the LORD.
c47522	“For I [know]
c47523	their works and thoughts;
c47524	the time is coming
c47525	to gather all nations and tongues,
c47526	and they will come
c47527	and see My glory.
c47528	I will establish a sign among them,
c47529	and I will send survivors from among them to Tarshish, Put, and Lud the archers, [to] Tubal, Javan, and the islands far away, [and] to the nations
c47530	who have not heard of My fame
c47531	or seen My glory.
c47532	So they will proclaim My glory among the nations.
c47533	And they will bring all your brothers from all the nations as a gift to the LORD on horses and chariots and wagons, on mules and camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem,”
c47534	says the LORD,
c47535	“just as the Israelites bring an offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.
c47536	And I will select some of them as priests and Levites,”
c47537	says the LORD.
c47538	“For
c47539	just as the new heavens and the new earth,
c47540	which I will make,
c47541	will endure before Me,”
c47542	declares the LORD,
c47543	“so your descendants and your name will endure.
c47545	From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come
c47546	to worship before Me,”
c47547	says the LORD.
c47548	“As they go forth,
c47549	they will see the corpses of the men
c47550	who have rebelled against Me;
c47551	for their worm will never die,
c47552	their fire will never be quenched,
c47553	and they will be a horror to all mankind.”
c47554	[These are] the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests
c47555	in Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
c47556	The word of the LORD came to [Jeremiah] in the thirteenth year ... of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah,
c47557	of the reign
c47558	and through the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah,
c47559	until ... of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah,
c47560	the fifth month ... when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.
c47561	The word of the LORD came to me,
c47562	saying:
c47563	“Before I formed you in the womb
c47564	I knew you,
c47565	and before you were born
c47566	I set you apart
c47567	[and] appointed you a prophet to the nations.”
c47568	I said,
c47569	“Ah, Lord GOD,”
c47570	“I surely do not know
c47571	how to speak,
c47572	for I [am] only a child!”
c47573	But the LORD told me:
c47574	“Do not say,
c47575	‘I [am] only a child.’
c47576	For to everyone
c47577	I send you,
c47578	you must go,
c47579	and all
c47580	that I command you,
c47581	you must speak.
c47582	Do not be afraid of them,
c47583	for I [am] with you
c47584	to deliver you,”
c47585	declares the LORD.
c47586	Then the LORD reached out His hand,
c47587	touched my mouth,
c47588	and said to me:
c47589	“Behold, I have put My words into your mouth.
c47590	See,
c47591	I have appointed you today over nations and kingdoms
c47592	to uproot
c47593	and tear down,
c47594	to destroy
c47595	and overthrow,
c47596	to build
c47597	and plant.”
c47598	And the word of the LORD came to me,
c47599	asking,
c47600	“What do you see,
c47601	Jeremiah?”
c47602	I replied.
c47603	“I see a branch of an almond tree,”
c47604	said the LORD,
c47605	correctly,”
c47606	“You have observed
c47607	“for I am watching over My word
c47608	to accomplish it.”
c47609	Again the word of the LORD came to me,
c47610	inquiring,
c47611	“What do you see?”
c47612	I replied,
c47613	“I see a boiling pot,”
c47614	“and it is tilting away from the north.”
c47615	Then the LORD said to me,
c47616	“Disaster from the north will be poured out on all who live in the land.
c47617	For I am about to summon all the clans and kingdoms of the north,”
c47618	declares the LORD.
c47619	“[Their kings] will come
c47620	and set up
c47621	their thrones
c47622	at the entrance to Jerusalem’s gates. They will attack all her surrounding walls and all the other cities of Judah.
c47623	I will pronounce My judgments against them for all the evil
c47624	they did, when they abandoned Me
c47625	to burn incense to other gods
c47626	and to worship the works of their own hands.
c47627	Get yourself ready.
c47628	Stand up
c47629	and tell them everything
c47630	that I command you.
c47631	Do not be intimidated by them,
c47632	or I will terrify you before them.
c47633	I
c47634	Now behold, this day ... have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land —against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
c47635	They will fight against you
c47636	but never overcome you,
c47637	since I am with
c47638	declares the LORD.
c47639	you to rescue you,”
c47640	Now the word of the LORD came to me,
c47641	saying:
c47642	“Go
c47643	and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem
c47644	says:
c47645	that this is what the LORD
c47646	I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride,
c47647	how you followed Me in the wilderness, in a land
c47648	not sown.
c47649	Israel was holy to the LORD,
c47650	the firstfruits of His harvest.
c47651	All who devoured her found themselves guilty;
c47652	disaster came upon them,
c47653	declares the LORD.”
c47654	Hear the word of the LORD,
c47655	O house of Jacob, and all you families of the house of Israel.
c47656	This is what the LORD says:
c47657	“What fault did your fathers find in Me
c47658	that they strayed so far from Me,
c47659	and followed worthless idols,
c47660	and became worthless themselves?
c47661	They did not ask,
c47662	‘Where is the LORD
c47663	who brought us from the land of Egypt,
c47664	who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and pits, through a land of drought and darkness, a land
c47665	where no one travels
c47666	and no one lives?’
c47667	I brought you into a fertile land
c47668	to eat its fruit and bounty,
c47669	but you came
c47670	and defiled My land,
c47671	and made My inheritance detestable.
c47672	The priests did not ask,
c47673	‘Where is the LORD?’
c47674	The experts in the law no longer knew Me,
c47675	and the leaders rebelled against Me.
c47676	The prophets prophesied by Baal
c47678	and followed useless idols.
c47680	Therefore, I will contend with you again,
c47681	declares the LORD,
c47682	and I will bring a case against your children’s children.
c47683	Cross over to Cyprus
c47684	and take a look;
c47685	send to Kedar
c47686	and consider carefully;
c47687	see
c47688	if there has ever been anything like this:
c47689	Has a nation ever changed its gods?
c47690	(though they were no gods [at all]!)
c47691	Yet My people have exchanged their Glory
c47692	for idols [that are] useless.
c47693	Be stunned
c47694	O heavens,
c47695	by this,
c47696	be shocked
c47697	and utterly appalled,
c47698	declares the LORD.
c47699	“For My people have committed two evils:
c47700	They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living water,
c47701	and they have dug cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns
c47702	that cannot hold water.
c47703	Is Israel a slave?
c47704	Was he born into slavery?
c47705	Why then has he become prey?
c47706	The young lions have roared at him;
c47707	they have growled with a loud voice.
c47708	They have laid waste his land;
c47709	his cities lie in ruins, without inhabitants.
c47710	The men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head.
c47711	Have you not brought this on yourself
c47712	by forsaking the LORD your God when
c47713	He led you in the way?
c47714	Now
c47715	what will you gain on your way to Egypt
c47716	to drink the waters of the Nile?
c47717	What will you gain on your way to Assyria
c47718	to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
c47719	Your own evil will discipline you;
c47720	your own apostasies will reprimand you.
c47721	Consider
c47722	and realize
c47723	how evil
c47724	and bitter it is
c47725	for you to forsake the LORD your God
c47726	and to have no fear of Me,”
c47727	declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.
c47728	“For long ago you broke your yoke
c47729	and tore off your chains,
c47730	saying,
c47731	“I will not serve!”
c47732	Indeed, on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down
c47733	as a prostitute.
c47734	I had planted you ... vine
c47735	like a choice ... from the very best seed.
c47736	How could you turn yourself before me, into a rotten wild vine?
c47737	Although you wash with lye
c47738	and use an abundance of soap,
c47739	the stain of your guilt is still before Me,”
c47740	declares the Lord GOD.
c47741	“How can you say,
c47742	‘I am not defiled;
c47743	I have not run after the Baals’?
c47744	Look at your behavior in the valley;
c47745	acknowledge
c47746	what you have done.
c47747	You are a swift young she-camel
c47748	galloping here and there,
c47749	a wild donkey
c47750	at home in the wilderness,
c47751	sniffing the wind ... of her desire.
c47752	in the heat
c47753	Who can restrain her passion?
c47754	All who seek her need not weary themselves;
c47755	in mating season they will find her.
c47756	Keep your feet from being unshod
c47757	and your throat from thirst.
c47758	But you say,
c47759	‘It is hopeless!
c47761	I love foreign [gods],
c47762	and I must go after them.’
c47763	As the thief is ashamed
c47764	when he is caught,
c47765	so the house of Israel is disgraced. They, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets
c47766	say to a tree,
c47767	‘You are my father,’
c47768	and to a stone,
c47769	‘You gave birth to me.’
c47770	For they have turned their backs to Me
c47771	and not their faces,
c47772	yet in the time of trouble they beg,
c47773	‘Rise up
c47774	and save us!’
c47775	But where are the gods
c47776	you made for yourself?
c47777	Let them rise up
c47778	and save you if they can in your time of trouble;
c47779	for your gods are as numerous as your cities,
c47780	O Judah.
c47781	Why do you bring a case against Me?
c47782	You have all rebelled against Me,”
c47783	declares the LORD.
c47784	“I have struck your sons in vain;
c47785	they accepted no discipline.
c47786	Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a voracious lion.
c47787	of this generation,
c47788	You [people] ... consider the word of the LORD:
c47789	Have I been a wilderness to Israel
c47790	or a land of dense darkness?
c47791	Why do My people say,
c47792	‘We [are free to] roam;
c47793	we will come to You no more’?
c47794	Does a maiden forget her jewelry
c47795	or a bride her wedding sash?
c47796	Yet My people have forgotten Me for days
c47797	without number.
c47798	How skillfully
c47799	you pursue love;
c47800	even the most immoral of women could learn from your ways.
c47801	Moreover, your skirts are stained with the blood of the innocent poor,
c47802	though you did not find them breaking in.
c47803	But in spite of all these things
c47804	you say,
c47805	‘I am innocent.
c47806	Surely His anger will turn from me.’
c47807	But I will certainly judge you,
c47808	because you say,
c47809	‘I have not sinned.’
c47810	How unstable you are, constantly
c47811	changing your ways!
c47812	You will be disappointed by Egypt
c47813	just as you [were] by Assyria.
c47814	Moreover, you will leave that place
c47815	with your hands on your head,
c47816	for the LORD has rejected those you trust;
c47817	you will not prosper by their help.”
c47819	“If a man divorces his wife
c47820	and she leaves him
c47821	to marry another,
c47822	can he ever return to her?
c47823	Would not such a land be completely defiled?
c47824	But you have played the harlot with many lovers—
c47825	and you would return to Me?”
c47826	declares the LORD.
c47827	“Lift up your eyes to the barren heights
c47828	and see.
c47829	Is there any place where you have not been violated?
c47830	You sat waiting for [your lovers] beside the highways, like a nomad in the desert.
c47831	You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.
c47832	Therefore the showers have been withheld,
c47833	and no spring rains have fallen.
c47834	Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute;
c47835	you refused
c47836	to be ashamed.
c47837	Have you not just called to Me,
c47838	‘My Father,
c47839	You [are] my friend from youth.
c47840	Will He be angry forever?
c47841	Will He be indignant to the end?’
c47842	This you have spoken,
c47843	but you keep doing all the evil
c47844	you can.”
c47845	Now in the days of King Josiah, the LORD said to me,
c47846	“Have you seen
c47847	what faithless Israel has done?
c47848	She has gone up on every high hill and under every green tree
c47849	to prostitute herself there.
c47850	I thought
c47851	that after she had done all these things,
c47852	she would return to Me.
c47853	But she did not return,
c47854	and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it.
c47855	Yet I saw
c47856	Because ... that
c47857	faithless Israel had committed adultery,
c47858	[and] sent her away.
c47859	I gave her a certificate of divorce
c47860	her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear
c47862	and prostituted herself [as well].
c47863	Indifferent to her immorality,
c47864	[Israel had] defiled the land
c47865	and committed adultery with stones and trees.
c47866	Yet in spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to Me with all her heart,
c47867	but only in pretense,”
c47868	declares the LORD.
c47869	And the LORD said to me,
c47870	“Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than unfaithful Judah.
c47871	Go,
c47872	proclaim this message toward the north:
c47874	‘Return,
c47875	O faithless Israel,’
c47876	declares the LORD.
c47877	‘I will no longer look on you with anger,
c47878	for I [am] merciful,’
c47879	declares the LORD.
c47880	‘I will not be angry forever.
c47881	Only acknowledge your guilt,
c47882	that you have rebelled against the LORD your God.
c47883	You have scattered your favors to foreign [gods] under every green tree
c47884	and have not obeyed My voice,’”
c47885	declares the LORD.
c47886	“Return,
c47887	O faithless children,”
c47888	declares the LORD,
c47889	“for I am your master,
c47890	and I will take you— one from a city and two from a family—
c47891	and bring you to Zion.
c47892	Then I will give ... shepherds after My own heart,
c47893	you ... who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.
c47895	when you multiply
c47896	In those days, ... and increase in the land,”
c47897	declares the LORD,
c47898	“no longer will they say,
c47899	‘The ark of the LORD’s covenant.’
c47900	It will never come to mind,
c47901	and no one will remember it
c47902	or miss it,
c47903	nor will another one be made.
c47904	At that time Jerusalem will be called The Throne of the LORD,
c47905	and all the nations will be gathered in Jerusalem to [honor] the name of the LORD.
c47906	They will no longer follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts.
c47907	In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel,
c47908	and they will come together from the land of the north to the land
c47909	I have given your ancestors as an inheritance.
c47910	Then I said,
c47911	‘How I long to make you My sons
c47912	and give you a desirable land, the most beautiful inheritance of all the nations.’
c47913	I thought
c47914	you would call Me ‘Father’
c47915	and never turn away from following Me.
c47916	But as a woman may betray her husband,
c47917	so you have betrayed Me,
c47918	O house of Israel,”
c47919	declares the LORD.
c47920	A voice is heard on the barren heights,
c47921	the children of Israel weeping and begging for mercy,
c47922	because they have perverted their ways
c47923	[and] forgotten the LORD their God.
c47924	“Return,
c47925	O faithless children,
c47926	[and] I will heal your faithlessness.”
c47927	“Here we are.
c47928	We come to You,
c47929	for You are the LORD our God.
c47930	Surely deception [comes from] the hills, commotion from the mountains,
c47931	but surely the salvation of Israel is in the LORD our God.
c47932	From our youth, that shameful [god] has consumed what our fathers have worked for— their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters.
c47933	Let us lie down in our shame;
c47934	let our disgrace cover us.
c47935	We have sinned against the LORD our God,
c47936	both we and our fathers; from our youth even to this day
c47937	we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.”
c47938	“If you will return,
c47939	O Israel,
c47940	declares the LORD.
c47941	return to Me,”
c47942	“If you will remove your detestable idols from My sight
c47943	and no longer waver,
c47944	and if you can swear,
c47945	‘As surely as the LORD lives,’
c47946	in truth, in justice, and in righteousness,
c47947	then the nations will be blessed by Him, and in Him
c47948	they will glory.”
c47949	For this is what the LORD says to the men of Judah and Jerusalem:
c47950	“Break up your unplowed ground,
c47951	and do not sow among the thorns.
c47952	Circumcise yourselves to the LORD,
c47953	remove the foreskins of your hearts,
c47954	O men of Judah and people of Jerusalem.
c47955	Otherwise, My wrath will break out like fire
c47956	and burn
c47957	with no one to extinguish it,
c47958	because of your evil deeds.”
c47959	Announce in Judah,
c47960	proclaim in Jerusalem,
c47961	and say:
c47962	“Blow the trumpet in the land.
c47963	Cry aloud
c47965	and say,
c47966	‘Assemble yourselves
c47967	and let us flee to the fortified cities.’
c47968	Raise a signal flag toward Zion.
c47969	Seek refuge!
c47970	Do not delay!
c47971	For I am bringing disaster from the north, and terrible destruction.
c47972	A lion has gone up from his thicket,
c47973	and a destroyer of nations has set out.
c47974	He has left his lair
c47975	to lay waste to your land.
c47976	Your cities will be reduced to ruins and lie uninhabited.
c47977	So put on sackcloth,
c47978	mourn
c47979	and wail,
c47980	for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned away from us.”
c47981	“In that day,”
c47982	declares the LORD,
c47983	“the king and officials will lose their courage.
c47984	The priests will tremble in fear,
c47985	and the prophets will be astounded.”
c47986	Then I said,
c47987	“Ah,
c47988	Lord GOD,
c47989	how completely You have deceived this people and Jerusalem
c47990	by saying,
c47991	‘You will have peace,’
c47992	when a sword is at our throats.”
c47993	At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem,
c47994	“A searing wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward the daughter of My people,
c47995	but not
c47996	to winnow
c47998	or to sift;
c47999	a wind too strong for that comes from Me.
c48000	Now I will also pronounce judgments against them.”
c48001	Behold, he advances like the clouds,
c48002	his chariots like the whirlwind.
c48003	His horses are swifter than eagles.
c48004	Woe to us,
c48005	for we are ruined!
c48006	Wash the evil from your heart,
c48007	O Jerusalem,
c48008	so that you may be saved.
c48009	How long will you harbor wicked thoughts within you?
c48010	For a voice resounds from Dan,
c48011	proclaiming disaster from Mount Ephraim.
c48012	Warn the nations
c48013	now! Proclaim to Jerusalem:
c48014	“A besieging army comes from a distant land;
c48015	they raise their voices against the cities of Judah.
c48016	They surround her like men guarding a field,
c48017	because she has rebelled against Me,
c48018	declares the LORD.
c48019	Your ways and your deeds have brought this upon you.
c48020	This is your punishment.
c48021	How bitter it is, because
c48022	it pierces to the heart!”
c48023	My anguish, my anguish!
c48024	I writhe in pain!
c48025	Oh, the pain in my chest!
c48026	My heart pounds within me;
c48027	I cannot be silent.
c48028	For ... have heard the sound of the trumpet,
c48029	I
c48030	the alarm of battle.
c48031	Disaster after disaster is proclaimed,
c48032	for the whole land is laid waste.
c48033	My tents are destroyed in an instant,
c48034	my curtains in a moment.
c48035	How long must I see the signal flag
c48036	and hear the sound of the trumpet?
c48037	“For My people are fools;
c48038	they have not known Me.
c48039	They are foolish children,
c48040	without understanding. They
c48041	are skilled
c48042	in doing evil,
c48044	how to do good.”
c48045	but they do not know
c48046	I looked at the earth,
c48047	and it was formless and empty;
c48048	[I looked] to the heavens,
c48049	and they [had] no light.
c48050	I looked at the mountains,
c48051	and behold, they were quaking;
c48052	all the hills were swaying.
c48053	I looked,
c48054	and no man was left;
c48055	all the birds of the sky had fled.
c48056	I looked,
c48057	and the fertile field was a desert.
c48058	All its cities were torn down before the LORD, before His fierce anger.
c48059	For this is what the LORD says:
c48060	“The whole land will be desolate,
c48061	but I will not finish its destruction.
c48062	Therefore the earth will mourn
c48063	[and] the heavens above grow dark.
c48064	I have spoken,
c48065	I have planned,
c48066	and I will not relent
c48067	or turn back.
c48068	Every city flees at the sound of the horseman and archer.
c48069	They enter the thickets
c48070	and climb among the rocks.
c48071	Every city is abandoned;
c48072	no inhabitant is left.
c48073	And you,
c48074	O devastated
c48075	one, what will you do,
c48076	though you dress yourself in scarlet,
c48077	though you adorn yourself with gold jewelry,
c48078	though you enlarge your eyes with paint?
c48079	You adorn yourself in vain;
c48080	your lovers despise you;
c48081	they want to take your life.
c48082	I hear a cry like a woman in labor, ... for
c48083	a cry of anguish like one bearing her first child—
c48084	the cry of the Daughter of Zion gasping for breath,
c48085	stretching out her hands:
c48086	‘Woe is me,
c48087	my soul faints before the murderers!’”
c48088	Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem.
c48089	Look now
c48090	and take note;
c48091	search her squares.
c48092	If you can find a single person,
c48094	[anyone] who acts justly,
c48095	[anyone] who seeks the truth,
c48096	then I will forgive [the city].
c48097	Although
c48098	“As surely as the LORD lives,”
c48099	they say,
c48100	they are swearing falsely.
c48101	O LORD,
c48102	Your eyes [look]
c48103	do not ... for truth?
c48104	You struck them,
c48105	but they felt no pain.
c48106	You finished them off,
c48107	but they refused
c48108	to accept discipline.
c48109	They have made their faces harder than stone
c48110	and refused
c48111	to repent.
c48112	Then I said,
c48113	“They are only the poor;
c48114	they have played the fool,
c48115	for they do not know the way of the LORD,
c48116	the justice of their God.
c48117	I will go to the powerful
c48118	and speak to them.
c48119	Surely they know the way of the LORD,
c48120	the justice of their God.
c48121	But they too, with one accord, had broken the yoke
c48122	and torn off the chains.
c48123	Therefore a lion from the forest will strike them down,
c48124	a wolf from the desert will ravage them.
c48125	A leopard will lie in wait near their cities,
c48126	[and] everyone
c48127	who ventures out
c48128	will be torn to pieces.
c48129	For their rebellious acts are many,
c48130	[and] their unfaithful deeds are numerous.
c48131	“Why should I forgive you?
c48132	Your children have forsaken Me
c48133	and sworn by [gods] that are not gods.
c48134	I satisfied their needs,
c48135	yet they committed adultery
c48136	and assembled at the houses of prostitutes.
c48137	They are well-fed, lusty stallions,
c48138	each ... after his neighbor’s wife.
c48139	neighing
c48140	Should I not punish them for these things?”
c48141	declares the LORD.
c48142	on such a nation
c48143	as this?
c48144	“Should I not avenge Myself
c48145	Go up through her vineyards
c48146	and ravage them,
c48147	but do not finish them off.
c48148	Strip off her branches,
c48149	for they do not belong to the LORD.
c48150	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to Me,”
c48151	declares the LORD.
c48152	They have lied about the LORD
c48153	and said,
c48154	“He will not do anything;
c48155	harm will not come to us;
c48156	we will not see sword or famine.
c48157	The prophets are but wind,
c48159	for the LORD’s word
c48160	is not in them.
c48161	So let [their own words] be done to them.”
c48162	Therefore
c48163	this is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says:
c48164	“Because you have spoken this word,
c48165	I will make My words a fire in your mouth
c48166	and this people the wood
c48167	it will consume.
c48168	Behold, I am bringing a distant nation against you,
c48169	O house of Israel,”
c48170	declares the LORD.
c48171	“It is an established nation,
c48172	an ancient nation,
c48173	a nation
c48174	whose language you do not know
c48175	you do not understand.
c48176	and whose speech
c48177	Their quivers are like open graves;
c48178	they are all mighty warriors.
c48179	They will devour your harvest and food;
c48180	they will consume your sons and daughters;
c48181	they will eat up your flocks and herds;
c48182	they will feed on your vines and fig trees.
c48183	they will destroy the fortified cities
c48184	in which you trust.
c48185	With the sword
c48186	Yet even in those days,
c48187	declares the LORD,
c48188	I will not make a full end of you.
c48189	And
c48190	when the people ask,
c48191	‘For what offense has the LORD our God done all these things to us?’
c48192	You are to tell them,
c48193	‘Just as you have forsaken Me
c48194	and served foreign gods in your land,
c48195	so will you serve foreigners in a land
c48196	that is not your own.’
c48197	Declare this in the house of Jacob
c48198	and proclaim it in Judah:
c48200	Hear this,
c48201	O foolish and senseless people,
c48202	who have eyes
c48203	but do not see,
c48204	who have ears
c48205	but do not hear.
c48206	Do you not fear Me?
c48207	declares the LORD.
c48208	Do you not tremble before Me,
c48209	the One who set the sand as the boundary of the sea,
c48210	an enduring barrier
c48211	it cannot cross?
c48212	surge,
c48213	but they cannot prevail.
c48214	The waves ... They roar
c48215	but cannot cross it.
c48216	But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts.
c48217	They have turned aside
c48218	and gone away.
c48219	They have not said in their hearts,
c48220	‘Let us fear the LORD our God,
c48221	who gives the rains, both autumn and spring, in season,
c48222	who keeps for us the appointed weeks of harvest.’
c48223	Your iniquities have diverted these from you;
c48224	your sins have deprived you of My bounty.
c48225	For My people are among wicked men.
c48226	They watch
c48227	like fowlers lying in wait;
c48228	they set a trap;
c48229	they catch men.
c48230	Like cages
c48231	full of birds,
c48232	so their houses are full of deceit.
c48233	Therefore they have become powerful
c48234	and rich.
c48235	They have grown fat
c48236	and sleek,
c48237	and have excelled in evil matters.
c48238	They have not taken up the cause
c48239	of the fatherless,
c48240	so they might prosper,
c48241	nor have they defended the rights of the needy.
c48242	Should I not punish them for these things?
c48243	declares the LORD.
c48244	on such a nation
c48245	as this?
c48246	Should I not avenge Myself
c48247	A horrible and shocking thing has happened in the land.
c48248	The prophets prophesy falsely,
c48249	and the priests rule by their own authority.
c48250	My people love it so,
c48251	but what will you do in the end?”
c48252	Run for cover,
c48253	O sons of Benjamin,
c48254	[flee from] Jerusalem!
c48255	Sound the trumpet in Tekoa;
c48256	send up a signal over Beth-haccherem,
c48257	for disaster looms from the north,
c48258	even great destruction.
c48259	Though she is beautiful and delicate, I will destroy
c48260	the Daughter of Zion.
c48261	Shepherds and their flocks will come against her;
c48262	they will pitch their tents all around her,
c48264	each tending his own portion:
c48265	“Prepare for battle against her;
c48266	rise up,
c48267	let us attack at noon.
c48268	Woe to us,
c48269	for the daylight is fading;
c48270	the evening shadows grow long.
c48271	Rise up,
c48272	let us attack by night
c48273	and destroy her fortresses!”
c48274	For this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c48275	“Cut down the trees
c48276	and raise a siege ramp against Jerusalem.
c48277	This city
c48278	must be punished;
c48279	there is nothing but
c48280	oppression in her midst.
c48281	As a well gushes its water,
c48282	so she pours out her evil.
c48283	Violence and destruction resound in her;
c48284	sickness and wounds are ever before Me.
c48285	Be warned,
c48286	O Jerusalem,
c48287	or I will turn away from you;
c48288	I will make you a desolation,
c48289	a land
c48290	without inhabitants.”
c48291	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c48292	“Glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine.
c48293	Pass your hand once more like a grape gatherer over the branches.”
c48294	To whom can I give
c48295	this warning?
c48296	Who will listen [to me]?
c48297	Look, their ears are closed,
c48298	so they cannot
c48299	hear.
c48300	See, the word of the LORD has become offensive to them;
c48301	they find no pleasure in it.
c48302	But I am full of the LORD’s wrath;
c48303	I am tired
c48304	of holding it back.
c48305	Pour it out on the children in the street, and on the young men gathered together.
c48306	For both husband and wife will be captured,
c48307	the old and the very old.
c48308	Their houses will be turned over to others,
c48309	their fields and wives as well,
c48310	for I will stretch out My hand against the inhabitants of the land,”
c48311	declares the LORD.
c48312	“For from the least of them to the greatest, all are greedy for gain.
c48313	From prophet to priest, all practice deceit.
c48314	They have dressed the wound of My people with very little care,
c48315	saying,
c48316	‘Peace, peace,’
c48317	when there is no peace [at all].
c48318	Were they ashamed
c48319	of the abomination they committed?
c48320	No, they were not at all ashamed.
c48321	how to blush.
c48322	They did not even know
c48323	So they will fall among the fallen;
c48324	when
c48325	I punish them,
c48326	they will collapse,”
c48327	says the LORD.
c48328	This is what the LORD says:
c48329	“Stand at the crossroads
c48330	and look.
c48331	Ask for the ancient paths:
c48332	Where [is] the good way?
c48333	Then walk in it
c48334	and find rest for your souls.
c48335	But they said,
c48336	‘We will not walk in it!’
c48337	I appointed watchmen over you [and said],
c48338	‘Listen for the sound of the ram’s horn.’
c48339	But they answered,
c48340	‘We will not listen!’
c48341	Therefore hear,
c48342	O nations,
c48343	and learn,
c48344	O congregations,
c48345	what will happen to them.
c48346	Hear,
c48347	O earth!
c48348	I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their own schemes,
c48349	for they have paid no attention to My word
c48350	My instruction.
c48351	and have rejected
c48352	What use to Me is frankincense from Sheba
c48353	or sweet cane from a distant land?
c48354	Your burnt offerings are not acceptable;
c48355	your sacrifices do not please Me.”
c48356	Therefore, this is what the LORD says:
c48357	“I will lay stumbling blocks before this people;
c48358	fathers and sons alike will be staggered; friends and neighbors
c48359	will perish.”
c48360	This is what the LORD says:
c48361	“Behold, an army is coming from the land of the north;
c48362	a great nation is stirred from the ends of the earth.
c48363	They grasp the bow and spear.
c48364	They are cruel
c48365	and show no mercy.
c48366	Their voice roars like the sea,
c48367	and they ride upon horses,
c48368	lined up like men in formation against you,
c48369	O Daughter of Zion.”
c48370	“We have heard the reports;
c48371	our hands are limp.
c48372	Anguish has gripped us,
c48373	pain like a woman in labor.
c48374	Do not go out to the fields;
c48375	do not walk the road.
c48376	For the enemy has a sword;
c48377	terror is on every side.”
c48378	“O daughter of My people,
c48379	dress yourselves in sackcloth
c48380	and roll in ashes.
c48381	Mourn with bitter wailing, as you would for an only son,
c48382	for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.”
c48383	I have appointed you a tester of metals among My people,
c48384	so you may know
c48385	and try their ways.
c48386	All are hardened rebels,
c48387	walking around as slanderers.
c48388	They are bronze and iron;
c48389	all
c48390	of them are corrupt.
c48391	The bellows blow fiercely, blasting away
c48392	the lead [with fire]. The refining [proceeds] in vain,
c48393	for the wicked are not purged.
c48394	They are called rejected silver,
c48395	for the LORD has rejected them.
c48396	This is the word
c48397	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
c48398	saying,
c48399	“Stand in the gate of the house of the LORD
c48400	and proclaim this message:
c48402	‘Hear the word of the LORD,
c48403	all you people of Judah
c48404	who enter through these gates
c48405	to worship the LORD.
c48406	Thus says the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel:
c48407	Correct your ways and your deeds,
c48408	and I will allow you to live in this place.
c48409	Do not trust in deceptive words,
c48410	chanting,
c48411	“This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.”
c48412	For if you really change your ways and deeds,
c48413	if you act justly toward one another,
c48414	if you no longer oppress the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow,
c48415	and no longer shed innocent blood in this place
c48416	or follow other gods to your own harm,
c48417	then I will allow you to live in this place, in the land
c48418	I gave to your fathers forever and ever.
c48419	But look, you keep trusting in deceptive words
c48420	to no avail.
c48421	Will you steal
c48422	and murder,
c48423	commit adultery
c48424	and perjury,
c48425	burn incense to Baal,
c48426	and follow other gods
c48427	that you have not known,
c48428	and then come
c48429	and stand before Me in this house,
c48430	which bears My name,
c48431	and say,
c48432	“We are delivered,
c48433	so we can continue with all these abominations”?
c48434	Has this house, ... become a den of robbers
c48435	which bears My name,
c48436	in your sight?
c48437	I too
c48438	Yes, ... have seen it,
c48439	declares the LORD.
c48440	But go now to the place
c48441	in Shiloh
c48442	where I first made a dwelling for My name,
c48443	and see
c48444	what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel.
c48445	And now,
c48446	because you have done all these things,
c48447	declares the LORD,
c48448	and because I have spoken to
c48449	you time and time again
c48451	but you would not listen,
c48452	and I have called to you
c48453	but you would not answer,
c48454	I will now do to the house
c48455	bears My name,
c48456	that ... you trust,
c48457	the place
c48458	the house in which ... I gave to you and your fathers.
c48459	therefore what I did to Shiloh ... that
c48460	And I will cast you out of My presence,
c48461	just as I have cast out all your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.’
c48462	As for you,
c48463	do not pray for these people.
c48464	Do not offer a plea or petition on their behalf,
c48465	and do not beg Me,
c48466	for I will not listen to you.
c48467	Do you not see
c48468	what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
c48469	The sons gather wood,
c48470	the fathers light the fire,
c48471	and the women knead the dough
c48472	to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven;
c48473	they pour out drink offerings to other gods
c48474	to provoke Me to anger.
c48475	But am I the one they are provoking?
c48476	declares the LORD.
c48477	Is it not themselves they spite, to their own shame?
c48478	Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says:
c48479	Behold, My anger, My fury, will be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the trees of the field and the produce of the land,
c48480	and it will burn
c48481	and not be extinguished.
c48482	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c48483	‘Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices
c48484	and eat the meat yourselves!
c48485	For ... your fathers ... I did not merely
c48486	command them
c48487	when
c48488	I brought ... out of the land of Egypt,
c48489	about burnt offerings and sacrifices,
c48490	but this is what I commanded them:
c48492	Obey Me,
c48493	and I will be your God,
c48494	and you will be My people.
c48495	You must walk in all the ways
c48496	I have commanded you,
c48497	so that it may go well with you.
c48498	Yet they did not listen
c48499	or pay attention, ... and not forward.
c48500	but they followed the stubborn inclinations of their own evil hearts.
c48501	They went backward
c48503	From the day
c48504	your fathers came out of the land of Egypt
c48505	until this day,
c48506	I have sent you all My servants the prophets
c48507	time and time again.
c48509	Yet they would not listen to Me
c48510	[or] incline their ear,
c48511	but they stiffened their necks
c48512	[and] did more evil than their fathers.’
c48513	When you tell them all these things,
c48514	they will not listen to you.
c48515	When you call to them,
c48516	they will not answer.
c48517	Therefore you must say to them:
c48518	This is the nation
c48519	that would not listen to the voice of the LORD their God
c48520	and would not receive correction.
c48521	Truth has perished;
c48522	it has disappeared from their lips.
c48523	Cut off your hair
c48524	and throw it away.
c48525	Raise up a lamentation on the barren heights,
c48526	for the LORD has rejected
c48527	and forsaken the generation of His wrath.
c48528	For the people of Judah have done
c48529	evil in My sight,
c48530	declares the LORD.
c48531	They have set up their abominations in the house
c48532	that bears My name,
c48533	and so have defiled it.
c48534	They have built the high places of Topheth
c48535	in the Valley of Hinnom ... their sons
c48536	so they could burn ... and daughters in the fire—
c48537	something I did not command,
c48538	nor did it enter My mind.
c48539	So beware! The days are coming,
c48540	declares the LORD,
c48541	when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom,
c48542	but the Valley of Slaughter.
c48543	For they will bury [the dead] in Topheth until there is no more room.
c48544	The corpses of this people will become food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth,
c48545	and there will be no one to scare them away.
c48546	I will remove from the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sounds of joy and gladness and the voices of the bride and bridegroom,
c48547	for the land will become a wasteland.”
c48548	“At that time,”
c48549	declares the LORD,
c48550	“the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of the officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves.
c48551	They will be exposed to the sun and moon, and all the host of heaven
c48552	which they have loved,
c48553	served,
c48554	followed,
c48555	consulted,
c48556	and worshiped.
c48557	Their bones will not be gathered up
c48558	[or] buried,
c48559	but will become like dung lying on the ground.
c48560	the remnant ... will choose death over life,
c48561	of this evil family
c48562	And wherever
c48563	I have banished them,
c48564	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c48565	So you are to tell them
c48566	this is what the LORD says:
c48567	‘Do [men] fall
c48568	and not get up again?
c48569	Does one turn away
c48570	and not return?
c48571	Why [then] have these people turned away?
c48572	Why does Jerusalem always turn away?
c48573	They cling to deceit;
c48574	they refuse
c48575	to return.
c48576	I have listened
c48577	and heard;
c48578	they do not speak what is right.
c48579	No one repents of his wickedness,
c48580	asking,
c48581	“What have I done?”
c48582	Everyone has stayed his course like a horse
c48583	charging into battle.
c48584	Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons.
c48585	The turtledove, the swift, and the thrush observe their time
c48586	of migration,
c48587	but My people do not know the requirements of the LORD.
c48588	How can you say,
c48589	‘We are wise,
c48590	and the law of the LORD is with us?’
c48591	But in fact, the lying pen of the scribes has produced a deception.
c48592	The wise will be put to shame;
c48593	they will be dismayed
c48594	and snared.
c48595	They have rejected the word of the LORD,
c48596	so what wisdom do they really have?
c48597	Therefore I will give their wives to other men
c48598	[and] their fields to new owners,
c48599	for from the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain;
c48600	from the prophet to the priest, all practice deceit.
c48601	They dress the wounds of the daughter of My people with very little care,
c48602	saying,
c48603	‘Peace, peace,’
c48604	when there is no peace.
c48605	Are they ashamed
c48606	of their loathsome conduct?
c48607	No, they have no shame at all,
c48609	to blush.
c48610	not even [enough]
c48611	Therefore they will fall among the fallen.
c48612	When I punish them, they will collapse,
c48613	says the LORD.
c48614	I will take away their harvest,
c48615	declares the LORD.
c48616	There will be no grapes on the vine,
c48617	nor figs on the tree,
c48618	and even the leaf will wither.
c48619	Whatever I have given them
c48620	will be lost to them.”
c48621	“Why are we just sitting here?
c48622	Gather together,
c48623	let us flee to the fortified cities
c48624	and perish there,
c48625	for the LORD our God has doomed us.
c48626	He has given us poisoned water to drink,
c48627	because we have sinned against the LORD.
c48628	We hoped for peace,
c48629	but no good [has come],
c48630	for a time of healing,
c48631	but there was only terror.
c48632	The snorting of [enemy] horses is heard from Dan.
c48633	At the sound of the neighing of mighty steeds, the whole land quakes.
c48634	They come
c48635	to devour the land and everything in it, the city
c48636	and all who dwell in it.”
c48637	“For behold, I will send snakes among you, poisonous vipers
c48638	that cannot be charmed,
c48639	and they will bite you,”
c48640	declares the LORD.
c48641	My sorrow is beyond healing;
c48642	my heart [is] faint within me.
c48643	Listen to the cry of the daughter of my people from a land far away,
c48644	“Is the LORD no longer in Zion?
c48645	Is her King no longer there?”
c48646	“Why have they provoked Me to anger with their carved images, with their worthless foreign idols?”
c48647	“The harvest has passed,
c48648	the summer has ended,
c48649	but we have not been saved.”
c48650	For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am crushed.
c48651	I mourn;
c48652	horror has gripped me.
c48653	Is there no balm in Gilead?
c48654	Is no physician there?
c48655	Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?
c48656	Oh, that my head were a spring of water,
c48657	and my eyes a fountain of tears,
c48658	I would weep day and night over the slain daughter of my people.
c48659	If only I had a traveler’s lodge in the wilderness,
c48660	I would abandon my people
c48661	and depart from them,
c48662	for they are all adulterers,
c48663	a crowd of faithless people.
c48664	“They bend their tongue
c48665	like their bows; lies
c48666	instead of truth prevail in the land,
c48667	for they proceed from evil to evil,
c48668	and they do not take Me into account,”
c48669	declares the LORD.
c48670	“Let everyone ... his neighbor;
c48671	guard
c48672	against ... do not trust any brother,
c48673	for every brother deals craftily,
c48674	and every friend spreads slander.
c48676	Each one ... his friend;
c48677	betrays
c48678	no one tells the truth.
c48679	They have taught their tongues
c48680	to lie;
c48681	they wear themselves out committing iniquity.
c48682	You dwell in the midst of deception;
c48683	in their deceit they refuse
c48684	to know Me,”
c48685	declares the LORD.
c48686	Therefore,
c48687	this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c48688	“Behold, I will refine
c48689	and test them,
c48690	for what else can I do because of the daughter of My people?
c48691	Their tongues are deadly arrows;
c48692	they speak deception.
c48693	With his mouth a man speaks peace to his neighbor,
c48694	but in his heart he sets a trap for him.
c48695	Should I not punish them for these things?
c48696	declares the LORD.
c48697	on such a nation
c48698	as this?”
c48699	Should I not avenge Myself
c48700	I will take up a weeping and wailing for the mountains,
c48701	a dirge over the wilderness pasture,
c48702	for they have been scorched
c48703	so no one passes through,
c48704	and the lowing of cattle is not heard.
c48705	Both the birds of the air and the beasts have fled;
c48706	they have gone away.
c48707	“And I will make Jerusalem a heap of rubble, a haunt for jackals;
c48708	and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.”
c48709	Who is the man wise
c48710	enough to understand this?
c48711	To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken,
c48712	that he may explain it?
c48713	Why is the land destroyed
c48714	and scorched like a desert, so no one can pass through it?
c48715	And the LORD answered,
c48716	“It is because they have forsaken My law
c48717	that I set before them;
c48718	they have not ... obeyed My voice.
c48719	walked in it [or]
c48720	Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts and gone after the Baals,
c48721	as their fathers taught them.”
c48722	Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c48723	“Behold, I will feed this people wormwood
c48724	and give them poisoned water to drink.
c48725	I will scatter them among the nations
c48726	that neither they [nor] their fathers have known,
c48727	and I will send a sword after
c48728	them until I have finished them off.”
c48729	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c48730	“Take note,
c48731	and summon the wailing women;
c48733	send for the [most] skillful [among them].
c48735	Let them come quickly
c48736	and take up a lament over us,
c48737	that our eyes may overflow with tears,
c48738	and our eyelids may stream with waters.
c48739	For the sound of wailing is heard from Zion:
c48740	‘How devastated we are!
c48741	How great is our shame,
c48742	for we have abandoned the land
c48743	because our dwellings have been torn down.’”
c48744	Now, ... hear
c48745	O women,
c48746	the word of the LORD.
c48747	Open your ears to the word of His mouth.
c48748	Teach your daughters to wail,
c48749	and one another to lament.
c48750	For death has climbed in through our windows;
c48751	it has entered our fortresses,
c48752	to cut off the children from the streets,
c48753	the young men from the town squares.
c48754	Declare that
c48755	this is what the LORD says:
c48756	“The corpses of men will fall like dung upon the open field,
c48757	like newly cut grain behind the reaper,
c48758	with no one to gather it.”
c48759	This is what the LORD says:
c48760	“Let not the wise [man] boast in his wisdom,
c48761	nor the strong man in his strength,
c48762	nor the wealthy man in his riches.
c48763	But let him who boasts boast in this,
c48764	that he understands
c48765	and knows Me,
c48766	that I am the LORD,
c48767	who exercises loving devotion, justice and righteousness on the earth—
c48768	for I delight in these things,”
c48769	declares the LORD.
c48770	“Behold, the days are coming,”
c48771	declares the LORD,
c48772	“when I will punish all who are circumcised yet uncircumcised:
c48773	Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all ... who clip the hair of their temples.
c48774	the inhabitants of the desert
c48775	All these nations [are really] uncircumcised,
c48776	and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”
c48777	Hear the word
c48778	that the LORD speaks to you,
c48779	O house of Israel.
c48780	This is what the LORD says:
c48781	“Do not learn the ways of the nations
c48782	or be terrified by the signs in the heavens,
c48783	although the nations are terrified by them.
c48784	For the customs of the peoples
c48785	are worthless;
c48786	they cut down a tree from the forest;
c48787	it is shaped with a chisel by the hands of a craftsman.
c48788	They adorn it with silver and gold
c48789	and fasten it with hammer and nails,
c48790	so that it will not totter.
c48791	Like scarecrows in a cucumber patch, their idols
c48792	cannot speak.
c48793	They must be carried
c48794	because they cannot walk.
c48795	Do not fear them,
c48796	for they can do no harm,
c48797	and neither can they do any good.”
c48798	There is none like You,
c48799	O LORD.
c48800	You are great,
c48801	and Your name is mighty in power.
c48802	Who would not fear You,
c48803	O King of nations?
c48804	This is Your due. For
c48805	among all the wise [men] of the nations, and in all their kingdoms,
c48806	there is none like You.
c48807	But they are altogether senseless
c48808	and foolish,
c48809	instructed by worthless idols
c48810	made of wood!
c48811	Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish,
c48812	and gold from Uphaz—
c48813	the work of a craftsman from the hands of a goldsmith.
c48814	Their clothing is blue and purple,
c48815	all fashioned by skilled workers.
c48816	But the LORD is the true God;
c48817	He is the living God and eternal King.
c48818	The earth quakes at His wrath,
c48819	and the nations cannot endure His indignation.”
c48820	Thus you are to tell them:
c48821	“The gods
c48822	that did not make heaven [or] earth
c48823	will perish from this earth and from under these heavens.”
c48824	[God] made the earth by His power;
c48825	He established the world by His wisdom
c48826	and stretched out the heavens by His understanding.
c48827	When He thunders,
c48829	the waters in the heavens roar,
c48830	and He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth.
c48831	He sends lightning with the rain
c48832	and brings the wind from His storehouses.
c48833	Everyone is senseless and devoid of knowledge.
c48834	Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols.
c48835	For his molten images are a fraud;
c48836	they have no breath in them.
c48837	They are worthless,
c48838	a work to be mocked.
c48839	In the time of their punishment, they will perish.
c48840	The Portion of Jacob is not like these,
c48841	for He is the Maker of all things:
c48842	Israel is the tribe of His inheritance;
c48843	the LORD of Hosts is His name.
c48844	Gather up your belongings from this land,
c48845	you who live under siege.
c48846	For this is what the LORD says:
c48847	“Behold, at this time I will sling out the inhabitants of the land
c48848	and bring distress on them
c48849	so that they may be captured.”
c48850	Woe to me because of my brokenness;
c48851	my wound is grievous!
c48852	But I said,
c48853	“This is truly my sickness,
c48854	and I must bear it.”
c48855	My tent is destroyed,
c48856	and all its ropes are snapped.
c48857	My sons have departed from me
c48858	and are no more.
c48859	I have no one left to pitch my tent
c48860	or set up my curtains.
c48861	For the shepherds have become senseless
c48862	and do not seek the LORD.
c48863	Therefore they have not prospered,
c48864	and all their flock is scattered.
c48865	The sound of a report
c48866	Listen! ... is coming—
c48867	a great commotion from the land to the north.
c48868	The cities of Judah will be made a desolation, a haunt of jackals.
c48869	I know,
c48870	O LORD,
c48871	that a man’s way is not his own;
c48872	no one
c48873	who walks
c48874	directs his own steps.
c48875	Correct me,
c48876	O LORD,
c48877	but only with justice—
c48878	not in Your anger,
c48879	or You will bring me to nothing.
c48880	Pour out Your wrath on the nations
c48881	that do not acknowledge You,
c48882	and on the families
c48883	that do not call on Your name.
c48884	For they have devoured Jacob;
c48885	they have consumed him
c48886	and finished him off;
c48887	they have devastated his homeland.
c48888	[This is] the word
c48889	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
c48891	“Listen to the words of this covenant
c48892	and tell them to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
c48893	You must tell them that
c48894	this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c48895	‘Cursed [is] the man
c48896	who does not obey the words of this covenant,
c48897	which I commanded your forefathers when
c48898	I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace,
c48899	saying,
c48900	“Obey Me,
c48901	and do everything
c48902	that I command you,
c48903	and you will be My people,
c48904	and I will be your God.”
c48905	[This was] in order to establish the oath
c48906	I swore to your forefathers,
c48907	to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,
c48908	as it is to this day.’”
c48909	I answered.
c48911	“Amen,
c48912	LORD,”
c48913	Then the LORD said to me,
c48914	“Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem,
c48915	saying,
c48916	‘Hear the words of this covenant
c48917	and carry them out.
c48918	For from the time ... your fathers ... I strongly warned
c48919	I brought ... out of the land of Egypt
c48920	until today,
c48921	them time and time again,
c48923	saying,
c48924	“Obey My voice.”
c48925	Yet they would ... obey
c48926	not ... or incline their ears,
c48927	but each one followed the stubbornness of his evil heart.
c48928	So I brought on them all the curses of this covenant
c48929	I commanded
c48930	but they did not keep.’”
c48931	them to follow
c48932	And the LORD told me,
c48933	“There is a conspiracy among the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
c48934	They have returned to the sins of their forefathers
c48935	who refused
c48936	to obey My words.
c48937	They have followed other gods
c48938	to serve them.
c48939	The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant
c48940	I made with their fathers.
c48941	Therefore this is what the LORD says:
c48942	I am about to bring upon them a disaster
c48943	that they cannot
c48944	escape.
c48945	They will cry out to Me,
c48946	but I will not listen to them.
c48947	Then the cities of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem will go
c48948	and cry out to the gods
c48949	to which they have been burning incense,
c48950	but [these gods] certainly will not save them in their time of disaster.
c48951	Your gods are indeed as numerous as your cities,
c48952	O Judah,
c48953	and the altars you have set up to shame— ... are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.
c48954	the altars
c48955	to burn incense to Baal—
c48956	As for you, do not pray for these people.
c48957	Do not raise up a cry or a prayer on their behalf,
c48958	for I will not be listening ... Me at the time
c48959	when they call out to ... of their disaster.
c48960	What right has My beloved in My house,
c48961	having carried out so many evil schemes?
c48962	Can consecrated meat avert
c48963	your doom,
c48964	so that you can rejoice?
c48965	The LORD once called you a flourishing olive tree, beautiful with well-formed fruit.
c48966	But with a mighty roar He will set fire to it,
c48967	and its branches will be consumed.
c48968	The LORD of Hosts
c48969	who planted you
c48970	has decreed disaster upon you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah
c48971	have brought upon themselves,
c48972	provoking Me to anger
c48973	by burning incense to Baal.”
c48974	And the LORD informed me,
c48975	so I knew.
c48976	Then You showed me their deeds.
c48977	For I was like a gentle lamb
c48978	led
c48979	to slaughter;
c48980	I did not know
c48981	that they had plotted against me:
c48982	“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit;
c48983	let us cut him off from the land of the living,
c48984	that his name will be remembered no more.”
c48985	But , O LORD of Hosts, who judges righteously,
c48986	who tests the heart and mind,
c48987	let me see Your vengeance upon them,
c48988	for I have committed my cause to You.
c48989	Therefore, this is what the LORD says concerning the people of Anathoth
c48990	who are seeking your life
c48991	and saying,
c48992	“You must not prophesy in the name of the LORD,
c48993	or you will die by our hand.”
c48994	So this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c48995	“I will punish them.
c48996	Their young men will die by the sword,
c48997	their sons and daughters by famine.
c48998	There will be no remnant,
c48999	for I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”
c49000	Righteous [are] You,
c49001	O LORD,
c49002	when I plead before You.
c49003	Yet I wish to contend with You:
c49004	Why does the way of the wicked prosper?
c49005	Why do all the faithless live at ease?
c49006	You planted them,
c49007	and they have taken root.
c49008	They have grown
c49009	and produced fruit.
c49010	You are ever on their lips,
c49011	but far from their conscience.
c49012	But You
c49013	O LORD;
c49014	know me,
c49015	You see me
c49016	and test my heart toward You.
c49017	Drag away [the wicked] like sheep to the slaughter
c49018	and set them apart for the day of carnage.
c49019	How long will the land mourn
c49020	and the grass of every field be withered?
c49021	Because of the evil of its residents, the animals and birds have been swept away,
c49022	for the people have said,
c49023	“He cannot see what our end will be.”
c49024	“If you have raced with men on foot
c49025	and they have worn you out,
c49026	how can you compete with horses?
c49027	If you stumble in a peaceful land,
c49028	how will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?
c49029	Even your brothers— your own father’s household—
c49030	even they have betrayed you;
c49031	even they have cried aloud against you.
c49032	Do not trust them,
c49033	though they speak well of you.
c49034	I have forsaken My house;
c49035	I have abandoned My inheritance.
c49036	I have given the love of My life into the hands of her enemies.
c49037	My inheritance has become to Me like a lion in the forest.
c49038	She has roared against Me;
c49039	therefore I hate her.
c49040	Is [not] My inheritance to Me like a speckled bird of prey,
c49041	with [other] birds of prey circling against her?
c49042	Go,
c49043	gather all the beasts of the field;
c49044	bring them to devour her.
c49045	Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard;
c49046	they have trampled My plot of land.
c49047	They have turned My pleasant field into a desolate wasteland.
c49048	They have made ... Desolate
c49049	it a desolation. ... before Me, it mourns;
c49050	all the land is laid waste,
c49051	but no man takes it to heart.
c49052	Over all the barren heights in the wilderness the destroyers have come,
c49053	for the sword of the LORD devours from [one] end of the earth to the other.
c49054	No flesh shall have peace.
c49055	They have sown wheat
c49056	but harvested thorns.
c49057	They have exhausted themselves
c49058	to no avail.
c49059	Bear the shame of your harvest because of the fierce anger of the LORD.”
c49060	This is what the LORD says: “As for all My evil neighbors
c49061	who attack the inheritance
c49062	that I bequeathed to My people Israel,
c49063	I am about to uproot them from their land,
c49064	and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.
c49065	But
c49066	after I have uprooted them,
c49067	I will once again
c49068	have compassion on them
c49069	and return
c49070	each one to his inheritance
c49071	and to his land.
c49072	And
c49073	if they will diligently learn the ways of My people—
c49074	to swear by My name,
c49075	‘As surely as the LORD lives,’
c49076	just as they taught My people
c49077	to swear by Baal—
c49078	then they will be established among My people.
c49079	But if they will not obey,
c49080	then I will uproot that nation;
c49081	I will uproot it
c49082	and destroy it,”
c49083	declares the LORD.
c49084	This is what the LORD said to me:
c49085	“Go
c49086	and buy yourself a linen loincloth
c49087	and put it around your waist,
c49088	but do not let it touch water.”
c49089	So I bought a loincloth as the LORD instructed me,
c49090	and I put it around my waist.
c49091	Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time:
c49093	“Take the loincloth
c49094	that you bought
c49095	and are wearing,
c49096	at once
c49097	and go ... to Perath
c49098	and hide it there in a crevice of the rocks.”
c49099	So I went
c49100	and hid it at Perath,
c49101	as the LORD had commanded me.
c49102	Many days later
c49103	the LORD said to me,
c49104	“Arise,
c49105	go to Perath
c49106	and get the loincloth ... there.”
c49107	that I commanded
c49108	you to hide
c49109	So I went to Perath
c49110	and dug up
c49111	the loincloth, and I took it from the place
c49112	where I had hidden it.
c49113	But now
c49114	[it] was ruined—
c49115	of no use at all.
c49116	Then the word of the LORD came to me:
c49118	“This is what the LORD says:
c49119	In the same way I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
c49120	These evil people,
c49121	who refuse
c49122	to listen to My words,
c49123	who follow the stubbornness of their own hearts,
c49124	and who go after other gods
c49125	to serve
c49126	and worship them,
c49127	they will be like this loincloth—
c49128	of no use at all.
c49129	For
c49130	just as a loincloth clings to a man’s waist,
c49131	so {I have made} the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to Me,
c49132	declares the LORD,
c49133	so that they might be My people for My renown and praise and glory—
c49134	but they did not listen.
c49135	Therefore you are to tell them that
c49136	this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c49137	‘Every wineskin shall be filled with wine.’
c49138	And when they reply,
c49139	‘Don’t we surely know
c49140	that every wineskin should be filled with wine?’
c49141	then you are to tell them
c49142	that this is what the LORD says:
c49143	‘I am going to fill ... all who live in this land—
c49144	the kings
c49145	who sit on David’s throne,
c49146	with drunkenness ... the priests, the prophets, and all the people of Jerusalem.
c49147	I will smash
c49148	them against each other,
c49149	fathers and sons alike,
c49150	declares the LORD.
c49151	I will allow no mercy
c49152	[or] pity
c49153	[or] compassion
c49154	to keep Me from destroying them.’”
c49155	Listen
c49156	and give heed.
c49157	Do not be arrogant,
c49158	for the LORD has spoken.
c49159	Give glory to the LORD your God
c49160	before He brings darkness,
c49161	before your feet stumble on the dusky mountains.
c49162	You wait for light,
c49163	but He turns it into deep gloom
c49164	and thick darkness.
c49165	But if you do not listen,
c49166	I will weep alone because of your pride;
c49168	My eyes will overflow with tears,
c49169	because the LORD’s flock has been taken captive.
c49170	Say to the king and to the queen mother:
c49171	“Take a lowly
c49172	seat,
c49173	for your glorious crowns have fallen from your heads.
c49174	The cities of the Negev have been shut tight,
c49175	and no one can open them.
c49176	All of Judah has been carried into exile,
c49177	wholly taken captive.
c49178	Lift up your eyes
c49179	and see
c49180	those coming from the north.
c49181	Where is the flock
c49182	entrusted to you,
c49183	the sheep that were your pride?
c49184	What will you say
c49185	when He sets over you
c49186	close allies whom you yourself trained?
c49187	Will not pangs of anguish grip you, as they do a woman in labor?
c49188	And if you ask yourself,
c49189	“Why has this happened to me?”
c49190	it is because of the magnitude of your iniquity. Your skirts have been stripped off,
c49191	your body exposed.
c49192	Can the Ethiopian change his skin,
c49193	or the leopard his spots?
c49194	Neither are you able
c49195	to do good—
c49196	you who are accustomed to doing evil.
c49197	“I will scatter you like chaff,
c49198	driven by the desert wind.
c49199	This is your lot,
c49200	the portion I have measured to you,”
c49201	declares the LORD,
c49202	“because you have forgotten Me
c49203	and trusted in falsehood.
c49204	So I will pull your skirts up over your face,
c49205	that your shame may be seen.
c49206	Your adulteries and lustful neighings, your shameless prostitution on the hills [and] in the fields—
c49207	I have seen your detestable acts.
c49208	Woe to you,
c49209	O Jerusalem!
c49210	How long will you remain unclean?”
c49211	[This is] the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
c49212	“Judah mourns
c49213	and her gates languish.
c49214	[Her people] wail for the land,
c49215	and a cry goes up from Jerusalem.
c49216	The nobles send their servants for water;
c49217	they go to the cisterns,
c49218	but find no water
c49219	return
c49220	their jars ... empty.
c49221	They are ashamed
c49222	and humiliated;
c49223	they cover their heads.
c49224	The ground is cracked
c49225	because no rain has fallen on the land.
c49226	The farmers are ashamed;
c49227	they cover their heads.
c49228	Even the doe in the field ... her newborn fawn
c49229	deserts
c49230	because there is no grass.
c49231	Wild donkeys stand on barren heights;
c49232	they pant for air like jackals;
c49233	their eyes fail
c49234	for lack of pasture.”
c49235	Although our iniquities testify against us,
c49236	O LORD,
c49237	act for the sake of Your name.
c49238	Indeed, our rebellions are many;
c49239	we have sinned against You.
c49240	O Hope of Israel,
c49241	its Savior in times of distress,
c49242	why are You like a stranger in the land,
c49243	like a traveler
c49244	who stays but a night?
c49246	Why are You like a man taken by surprise,
c49247	like a warrior
c49248	powerless
c49249	to save?
c49250	Yet You are among us,
c49251	O LORD,
c49252	and we are called by Your name.
c49253	Do not forsake us!
c49254	This is what the LORD says about this people:
c49255	“Truly they love
c49256	to wander;
c49257	they have not restrained their feet.
c49258	So the LORD does not accept them;
c49259	He will now remember their guilt
c49260	and call their sins to account.”
c49261	Then the LORD said to me,
c49262	“Do not pray for the well-being of this people.
c49263	Although they may fast,
c49264	I will not listen to their cry;
c49265	although they may offer burnt offerings and grain offerings,
c49266	I will not accept them.
c49267	Instead, I will finish them off by sword and famine and plague.”
c49268	I replied,
c49269	“Ah, Lord GOD!”
c49270	“Look, the prophets are telling them,
c49271	‘You will not see the sword
c49272	or suffer famine,
c49273	but I will give you lasting peace in this place.’”
c49274	the LORD replied.
c49275	“The prophets are prophesying lies in My name,”
c49276	“I did not send them
c49277	[or] appoint them
c49278	[or] speak to them.
c49279	They are prophesying to you a false vision, a worthless divination, the futility and delusion of their own minds.
c49280	Therefore, this is what the LORD says about the prophets
c49281	who prophesy in My name,
c49282	though I did not send them,
c49283	and who say,
c49284	‘No sword or famine will touch this land.’
c49285	By sword and famine these very prophets will meet their end!
c49286	And the people
c49287	to whom they prophesy
c49288	will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem because of famine and sword.
c49289	There will be no one to bury them or their wives, their sons or their daughters.
c49290	I will pour out their own evil upon them.
c49291	You are to speak this word to them:
c49292	“My eyes overflow with tears; day and night
c49293	they do not cease,
c49294	for the virgin daughter of my people has been shattered by a crushing blow,
c49295	a severely grievous wound.
c49296	If I go out to the country,
c49297	I see those slain by the sword;
c49298	if I enter the city,
c49299	I see those ravaged by famine!
c49300	For both prophet and priest travel to a land
c49301	they do not know.”
c49302	Have You rejected Judah completely?
c49303	Do You despise Zion?
c49304	Why have You stricken us
c49305	so that we are beyond healing?
c49306	We hoped for peace,
c49307	but no good has come,
c49308	and for the time of healing,
c49309	but there was only terror.
c49310	We acknowledge
c49311	O LORD,
c49312	our wickedness, ... the guilt of our fathers;
c49313	indeed, we have sinned against You.
c49314	For the sake of Your name do not despise us;
c49315	do not disgrace Your glorious throne.
c49316	Remember
c49317	Your covenant with us; do not break it.
c49318	Can the worthless idols of the nations bring rain?
c49319	Do the skies alone send showers?
c49320	Is this not by You,
c49321	O LORD our God?
c49322	So we put our hope in You,
c49323	for You have done all these things.
c49324	Then the LORD said to me:
c49325	“Even if Moses and Samuel should stand before Me,
c49326	My heart would not go out to this people.
c49327	Send them from My presence,
c49328	and let them go.
c49330	If they ask you,
c49331	‘Where shall we go?’
c49332	you are to tell them that
c49333	this is what the LORD says:
c49334	‘Those destined for death,
c49335	to death;
c49337	those destined for the sword,
c49338	to the sword;
c49340	those destined for famine,
c49341	to famine;
c49343	those destined for captivity,
c49344	to captivity.’
c49345	I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers,
c49346	declares the LORD:
c49347	the sword
c49348	to kill,
c49349	the dogs
c49350	to drag away,
c49351	and the birds of the air and beasts of the earth
c49352	to devour
c49353	and destroy.
c49354	I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of ... Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah
c49355	what ... did in Jerusalem.
c49356	Who will have pity on you,
c49357	O Jerusalem?
c49358	Who will mourn for you?
c49359	Who will turn aside
c49360	to ask about your welfare?
c49361	You have forsaken Me,
c49362	declares the LORD.
c49363	You have turned your back,
c49364	so I have stretched out My hand against you
c49365	to destroy you;
c49366	I am weary
c49367	of showing compassion.
c49368	I will scatter them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land.
c49369	I will bereave
c49370	and destroy My people
c49371	who have not turned from their ways.
c49372	I will make their widows more numerous than the sand of the sea.
c49373	I will bring a destroyer at noon against the mothers of young men.
c49374	I will suddenly bring upon them anguish and dismay.
c49375	The mother of seven will grow faint;
c49376	she will breath her last breath.
c49377	Her sun will set while it was still day;
c49378	she will be disgraced
c49379	and humiliated.
c49380	And the rest I will put to the sword in the presence of their enemies,”
c49381	declares the LORD.
c49382	Woe to me,
c49383	my mother,
c49384	that you have borne me, a man of strife and conflict in all the land.
c49385	I have neither lent
c49386	nor borrowed,
c49387	yet everyone curses me.
c49388	The LORD said:
c49389	“Surely I will deliver you for a good purpose;
c49390	surely I will intercede with your enemy in your time of trouble, in your time of distress.
c49391	Can anyone smash iron— iron from the north—
c49392	or bronze?
c49393	Your wealth and your treasures I will give up as plunder,
c49394	without charge
c49395	for all your sins within all your borders.
c49396	Then I will enslave you to your enemies in a land
c49397	you do not know,
c49398	for My anger will kindle a fire
c49399	that will burn against you.”
c49400	You understand,
c49401	O LORD;
c49402	remember me
c49403	and attend to me.
c49404	Avenge me against my persecutors.
c49405	In Your patience, do not take me away.
c49406	Know that
c49407	I endure reproach for Your honor.
c49408	Your words were found,
c49409	and I ate them.
c49410	Your words became a delight to me and my heart’s delight,
c49411	for I bear Your name,
c49412	O LORD God of Hosts.
c49413	I never sat with the band of revelers,
c49414	and I did not celebrate with them.
c49415	Because Your hand was on me, I sat alone,
c49416	for You have filled me with indignation.
c49417	Why is my pain unending,
c49418	and my wound incurable,
c49419	refusing
c49420	to be healed?
c49421	You have indeed become like a mirage to me—
c49422	water
c49423	that is not there.
c49424	Therefore this is what the LORD says:
c49425	“If you return,
c49426	I will restore you;
c49427	you will stand in My presence.
c49428	And if you speak words that are noble instead of worthless,
c49429	you will be My spokesman.
c49430	It is they who must return to you,
c49431	but you must not return to them.
c49432	Then I will make you a wall to this people, a fortified wall of bronze;
c49433	they will fight against you
c49434	but will not overcome you,
c49435	for I am with you
c49436	to save you
c49437	and deliver you.
c49438	declares the LORD.
c49439	I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked
c49440	and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.”
c49441	Then the word of the LORD came to me:
c49443	“You must not marry
c49444	[or] have sons or daughters in this place.”
c49445	For this is what the LORD says concerning sons and daughters
c49446	born in this place, ... who bore them,
c49447	and the mothers
c49448	who fathered
c49449	and the fathers
c49450	them in this land:
c49451	“They will die from deadly diseases.
c49452	They will not be mourned
c49453	or buried,
c49454	but will lie like dung on the ground.
c49455	They will be finished off by sword and famine,
c49456	and their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.”
c49457	Indeed, this is what the LORD says:
c49458	“Do not enter a house [where there is] a funeral meal.
c49459	Do not go
c49460	to mourn
c49461	or show sympathy,
c49462	for I have removed My peace from this people,
c49463	declares the LORD,
c49464	My loving devotion and compassion.
c49465	Both great and small will die in this land.
c49466	They will not be buried
c49467	[or] mourned,
c49468	nor will anyone cut
c49469	himself or shave his head for them.
c49470	No food will be offered ... those who mourn
c49471	to comfort ... the dead; ... for
c49472	not even a cup of consolation will be given ... the loss of a father or mother.
c49473	You must not enter a house where there is feasting
c49474	and sit down with them
c49475	to eat
c49476	and drink.
c49477	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c49478	I am going to remove from this place, before your very eyes and in your days, the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the groom and the bride.
c49480	When you tell these people all these things,
c49481	they will ask you,
c49482	‘Why has the LORD pronounced all this great disaster against us?
c49483	What is our guilt?
c49484	What is the sin
c49485	that we have committed against the LORD our God?’
c49486	Then you are to answer them:
c49487	‘[It is] because your fathers have forsaken Me,’
c49488	declares the LORD,
c49489	‘and followed other gods,
c49490	and served
c49491	and worshiped them.
c49492	They abandoned Me
c49493	and did not keep My instruction.
c49494	And you ... more evil
c49495	have done ... than your fathers.
c49496	See how each of you was following the stubbornness of his evil heart,
c49497	instead of obeying Me.
c49498	So I will cast you out of this land into a land
c49499	that neither you nor your fathers have known.
c49500	There you will serve other gods day and night,
c49501	for I will show you no favor.’
c49502	Yet behold, the days are coming,
c49503	declares the LORD,
c49504	when men will no longer say,
c49505	‘As surely as the LORD lives,
c49506	who brought the Israelites {up} out of the land of Egypt.’
c49507	Instead [they will say],
c49508	‘As surely as the LORD lives,
c49509	who brought the Israelites {up} out of the land of the north and all the other lands
c49510	to which He had banished them.’
c49511	For I will return them to their land
c49512	that I gave to their ancestors.
c49513	But for now I will send for many fishermen,
c49514	declares the LORD,
c49515	and they will catch them.
c49516	After that I will send for many hunters,
c49517	and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill, even from the clefts of the rocks.
c49518	For My eyes [are] on all their ways.
c49519	They are not hidden from My face,
c49520	and their guilt is not concealed from My eyes.
c49521	And I will first repay them double their iniquity and their sin,
c49522	because they have defiled My land
c49523	with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and they have filled My inheritance with their abominations.”
c49524	O LORD, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in the day of distress,
c49525	the nations will come to You from the ends of the earth,
c49526	and they will say,
c49527	“Our fathers inherited nothing but lies,
c49528	worthless idols
c49529	of no benefit at all.”
c49530	Can man make gods for himself?
c49531	Such are not gods!
c49532	“Therefore behold, I will inform them, and this time
c49533	I will make them know My power and My might;
c49534	then they will know
c49535	that My name is the LORD.”
c49536	The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus,
c49537	engraved with a diamond point on the tablet of their hearts and on the horns of their altars.
c49538	Even their children remember their altars and Asherah poles, by the green trees, on the high hills.
c49539	O My mountain in the countryside,
c49540	I will give over your wealth and all your treasures as plunder,
c49541	because of the sin of your high places, in all your borders.
c49542	And you yourself will relinquish
c49543	the inheritance
c49544	that I gave you.
c49545	I will enslave you to your enemies in a land
c49546	you do not know,
c49547	for you have kindled My anger;
c49548	it will burn forever.
c49549	This is what the LORD says:
c49550	“Cursed is the man
c49551	who trusts in mankind,
c49552	who makes the flesh his strength
c49553	and turns his heart from the LORD.
c49554	He will be like a shrub in the desert;
c49555	he will not see
c49556	when prosperity comes.
c49557	He will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land
c49558	where no one lives.
c49559	But blessed [is] the man
c49560	who trusts in the LORD,
c49561	whose confidence is [Him].
c49562	He will be like a tree
c49563	planted by the waters
c49564	that sends out its roots toward the stream.
c49565	It does not fear
c49566	when the heat comes,
c49567	and its leaves are always green.
c49568	It will not worry in a year of drought
c49569	or cease
c49570	producing fruit.
c49571	The heart [is] deceitful above all things
c49572	and beyond cure—
c49573	who can understand it?
c49574	I, the LORD, search the heart;
c49575	I test the mind
c49576	to reward a man according to his way, by what his deeds deserve.
c49577	Like a partridge hatching eggs
c49578	lay
c49579	is the man who makes a fortune
c49580	it did not ... unjustly.
c49581	In the middle of his days his riches will desert him,
c49582	and in the end he will be the fool.
c49583	A glorious throne,
c49584	exalted from the beginning,
c49585	is the place of our sanctuary.
c49586	O LORD, the hope of Israel,
c49587	all who abandon You will be put to shame.
c49588	All who turn away will be written in the dust,
c49589	for they have abandoned the LORD, the fountain of living water.
c49590	Heal me,
c49591	O LORD,
c49592	and I will be healed;
c49593	save me,
c49594	and I will be saved,
c49595	for You are my praise.
c49596	Behold, they keep saying to me,
c49597	“Where is the word of the LORD?
c49598	Let it come now!”
c49599	But I have not run away from being Your shepherd;
c49600	I have not desired the day of despair.
c49601	You know
c49602	that the utterance of my lips was [spoken] in Your presence.
c49603	Do not become a terror to me;
c49604	You are my refuge in the day of disaster.
c49605	Let my persecutors be put to shame,
c49606	but do not let me be put to shame.
c49607	Let them be terrified,
c49608	but do not let me be terrified.
c49609	Bring upon them the day of disaster
c49610	and shatter them with double destruction.
c49611	This is what the LORD said to me:
c49612	“Go
c49613	and stand at the gate of the people,
c49614	through which the kings of Judah go in
c49615	and out; and [stand]
c49616	at all [the other] gates of Jerusalem.
c49617	Say to them,
c49618	‘Hear the word of the LORD,
c49619	O kings of Judah, all [people] of Judah [and] Jerusalem
c49620	who enter through these gates.
c49621	This is what the LORD says:
c49622	Take heed for yourselves;
c49623	do not carry a load ... on the Sabbath day.
c49624	[or] bring it through the gates of Jerusalem
c49625	You must not carry a load out of your houses ... on the Sabbath day,
c49626	or do any work
c49627	but you must keep the Sabbath day {holy},
c49628	just as I commanded your forefathers.
c49629	Yet they would not listen
c49630	or incline their ear,
c49631	but they stiffened their necks
c49632	and would not listen
c49633	or receive My discipline.
c49634	however,
c49635	If, ... you listen carefully to Me,
c49636	says the LORD,
c49637	and bring no load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day,
c49638	and keep the Sabbath day {holy},
c49639	and do no work on it,
c49640	then kings and princes will enter through the gates of this city.
c49641	will sit on the throne of David,
c49642	riding in chariots and on horses
c49643	They ... with their officials, along with the men of Judah and residents of Jerusalem,
c49644	and this city will be inhabited forever.
c49645	And people will come from the cities of Judah and the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, and from the foothills, the hill country, and the Negev,
c49646	bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense,
c49647	and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.
c49648	But if you do not listen to Me
c49649	to keep the Sabbath day {holy}
c49650	by not carrying a load
c49651	while entering the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day,
c49652	then I will kindle ... fire in its gates
c49653	to consume the citadels of Jerusalem.’”
c49654	an unquenchable
c49655	This is the word
c49656	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
c49658	at once
c49659	“Go down ... to the potter’s house,
c49660	and there I will reveal My message to you.”
c49661	So I went down to the potter’s house
c49662	and saw him working at the wheel.
c49663	But the vessel ... became flawed
c49664	that he was shaping from the clay
c49665	in [his] hand;
c49667	so he formed it into another vessel,
c49668	as it seemed best for him
c49669	to do.
c49670	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c49671	saying,
c49672	can I not ... as this potter treats his clay?
c49673	treat you
c49674	“O house of Israel,
c49675	declares the LORD.
c49676	Just like clay in the potter’s hand,
c49677	so are you in My hand,
c49678	O house of Israel.
c49679	At any time I might announce that a nation or kingdom
c49680	will be uprooted,
c49681	torn down,
c49682	and destroyed.
c49683	But if that nation ... turns from its evil,
c49684	I warned
c49685	then I will relent of the disaster
c49686	I had planned
c49687	to inflict.
c49688	And if at another time I announce ... a nation or kingdom,
c49689	that I will build up
c49690	and establish
c49691	and if it does
c49692	evil in My sight
c49693	and does not listen to My voice,
c49694	I will relent of the good
c49695	I had intended for it.
c49697	Now therefore,
c49698	tell the men of Judah and residents of Jerusalem ... now,
c49699	says:
c49700	that this is what the LORD
c49701	‘Behold, I am planning a disaster for you
c49702	and devising a plan against you.
c49703	Turn ... each of you, from your evil ways,
c49704	and correct your ways and deeds.’
c49705	But they will reply,
c49706	‘It is hopeless.
c49707	We will follow our own plans,
c49709	and each of us ... according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’”
c49710	will act
c49711	Therefore, this is what the LORD says:
c49712	“Inquire among the nations:
c49713	Who has ever heard things like these?
c49714	Virgin Israel has done a most terrible thing.
c49715	Does the snow of Lebanon ever leave its rocky slopes?
c49716	Or do its cool waters flowing from a distance ever run dry?
c49717	Yet My people have forgotten Me.
c49718	They burn incense to worthless idols
c49719	that make them stumble in their ways on the ancient roads
c49720	and walk on bypaths
c49722	instead of the highway.
c49723	They have made their land a desolation, a perpetual object of scorn;
c49724	everyone
c49725	who passes by
c49726	will be appalled
c49727	and shake their heads.
c49728	I will scatter them before the enemy like the east wind.
c49729	them My back
c49730	and not My face
c49731	I will show ... in the day of their calamity.”
c49732	Then [some] said,
c49733	“Come,
c49734	let us make plans against Jeremiah,
c49735	for the law will never be lost to the priest,
c49736	or counsel to the wise,
c49737	or an oracle to the prophet.
c49738	Come,
c49739	let us denounce
c49740	him and pay no heed to any of his words.”
c49741	Give heed
c49742	O LORD.
c49743	to me,
c49744	Hear what my accusers are saying!
c49745	Should good be repaid with evil?
c49746	Yet they have dug a pit for me.
c49747	Remember
c49748	how I stood before You
c49749	to speak good on their behalf,
c49750	to turn Your wrath from them.
c49751	Therefore, hand their children over to famine,
c49752	pour out the power of the sword upon them.
c49753	Let their wives become childless and widowed,
c49754	their husbands be slain by disease,
c49755	and their young men struck down by the sword in battle.
c49756	Let a cry be heard from their houses
c49757	when You suddenly bring raiders against them,
c49758	for they have dug a pit
c49759	to capture me
c49760	and have hidden snares for my feet.
c49761	But You,
c49762	O LORD,
c49763	know all their deadly plots against me.
c49764	Do not wipe out their guilt
c49765	[or] blot out their sin from Your sight.
c49766	Let them be overthrown before You;
c49767	deal with them in the time of Your anger.
c49768	This is what the LORD says:
c49769	“Go,
c49770	buy a clay jar from a potter.
c49771	Take some of the elders of the people and leaders of the priests,
c49772	and go out to the valley of Ben-hinnom
c49773	near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate.
c49774	Proclaim there the words
c49775	I speak to you,
c49776	saying,
c49777	‘Hear the word of the LORD,
c49778	O kings of Judah and residents of Jerusalem.
c49779	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c49780	I am going to bring such disaster on this place
c49781	that ... of all
c49782	who hear of it
c49783	the ears ... will ring,
c49784	because they have abandoned Me
c49785	and made this a foreign place.
c49786	They have burned incense in it to other gods
c49787	that [neither] they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have [ever] known.
c49788	They have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.
c49789	They have built high places to Baal
c49790	on which to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—
c49791	something I never commanded
c49792	or mentioned, nor
c49793	did it [ever] enter My mind.
c49794	So behold, the days are coming,
c49795	declares the LORD,
c49796	when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom,
c49797	but the Valley of Slaughter.
c49798	And in this place I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem.
c49799	I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hands of those who seek their lives,
c49800	and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
c49801	I will make this city a desolation and an [object of] scorn.
c49802	All
c49803	who pass by
c49804	will be horrified,
c49805	and will scoff because of all its wounds.
c49806	I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, ... flesh
c49808	one another’s
c49809	and they will eat ... in the siege and distress
c49810	inflicted on them by their enemies who seek their lives.’
c49811	Then you are to shatter the jar in the presence of the men
c49812	who accompany you,
c49813	and you are to proclaim to them
c49814	that this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c49815	I will shatter this nation and this city,
c49816	like one shatters a potter’s jar
c49817	that can never
c49818	again be repaired.
c49819	They will bury the dead in Topheth since there is nowhere else
c49820	to bury [them].
c49821	This is what I will do to this place
c49822	declares the LORD.
c49823	and to its residents,
c49824	I will make this city like Topheth.
c49825	The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be ... like that place, Topheth—
c49826	defiled ... all the houses
c49827	on whose rooftops they burned incense to all the heavenly hosts
c49828	and poured out drink offerings to other gods.”
c49829	Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth,
c49830	where the LORD had sent
c49831	him to prophesy,
c49832	and he stood in the court of the LORD’s house
c49833	and proclaimed to all the people,
c49834	“Thus says the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel:
c49835	‘I am about to bring on this city and on all the villages around it every disaster
c49836	I have pronounced against them,
c49837	because they have stiffened their necks
c49838	so as not to heed My words.’”
c49839	When Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer ... heard
c49840	and the chief official in the temple of the LORD,
c49841	Jeremiah
c49842	prophesying these things,
c49843	[he] had Jeremiah the prophet beaten,
c49844	and he put him in the stocks
c49845	at the Upper Gate of Benjamin,
c49846	which [was] by the house of the LORD.
c49847	The next day,
c49848	when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks,
c49849	Jeremiah said to him,
c49850	“The LORD does not call you Pashhur,
c49851	but Magor-missabib.
c49852	For this is what the LORD says:
c49853	‘I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends.
c49854	They will fall by the sword of their enemies
c49855	before your very eyes.
c49856	And I will hand Judah over to the king of Babylon,
c49857	and he will carry them away to Babylon
c49858	and put them to the sword.
c49859	I will give away all the wealth of this city— all its products and valuables,
c49860	and all the treasures of the kings of Judah— to their enemies.
c49861	They will plunder them,
c49862	seize them,
c49863	and carry them off to Babylon.
c49864	And you,
c49865	Pashhur,
c49866	and all who live in your house, will go into captivity.
c49867	You will go to Babylon,
c49868	and there you will die
c49869	and be buried—
c49870	you and all your friends
c49871	to whom you have prophesied these lies.’”
c49872	You have deceived me,
c49873	O LORD,
c49874	and I was deceived.
c49875	You have overcome me
c49876	and prevailed.
c49877	I am a laughingstock all day long;
c49878	everyone mocks me.
c49879	For
c49880	whenever I speak,
c49881	I cry out,
c49882	I proclaim violence and destruction.
c49883	For the word of the LORD has become to me a reproach and derision all day long.
c49884	If I say,
c49885	“I will not mention Him
c49886	or speak any more in His name,”
c49887	[His message] becomes a fire burning in my heart,
c49888	shut up in my bones,
c49889	and I become weary
c49890	of holding it in,
c49891	and I cannot prevail.
c49892	For I have heard the whispering of many,
c49893	“Terror is on every side!
c49894	Report him;
c49895	let us report him!”
c49896	All my trusted friends watch for my fall:
c49897	“Perhaps he will be deceived
c49898	so that we may prevail against him
c49899	and take our vengeance upon him.”
c49900	But the LORD is with me like a fearsome warrior.
c49901	Therefore, my persecutors will stumble
c49902	and not prevail.
c49903	they will be utterly put to shame,
c49904	Since they have not succeeded,
c49905	with an everlasting disgrace that will never be forgotten.
c49906	O LORD of Hosts, who examines the righteous,
c49907	who sees the heart and mind,
c49908	let me see Your vengeance upon them,
c49909	for to You I have committed my cause.
c49910	Sing to the LORD!
c49911	Praise the LORD!
c49912	For He rescues the life of the needy from the hands of evildoers.
c49913	Cursed be the day
c49914	I was born!
c49915	May the day
c49916	my mother bore me
c49917	never be blessed.
c49918	Cursed be the man
c49919	who brought my father {the news},
c49920	saying,
c49921	“A son is born to you,”
c49922	bringing him great joy.
c49923	May that man be like the cities
c49924	the LORD overthrew
c49925	without compassion.
c49926	May he hear an outcry in the morning
c49927	and a battle cry at noon,
c49928	because he did not kill me in the womb
c49929	so that my mother might have been my grave,
c49930	and her womb forever enlarged.
c49931	Why did I come out of the womb
c49932	to see only trouble and sorrow,
c49933	and to end my days in shame?
c49934	This is the word
c49935	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD
c49936	when King Zedekiah sent to [him] Pashhur son of Malchijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah,
c49937	saying,
c49938	“Please inquire of the LORD on our behalf,
c49939	since Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is waging war against us.
c49940	Perhaps the LORD will perform for us something like all His past wonders,
c49941	so that [Nebuchadnezzar] will withdraw from us.”
c49942	But Jeremiah answered,
c49943	“You are to tell Zedekiah the following:
c49944	‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c49945	I will turn against you the weapons of war
c49946	in your hands,
c49947	with which you are fighting the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans
c49948	who besiege you
c49949	outside the wall,
c49950	and I will assemble [their forces] in the center of this city.
c49951	And I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, with anger, fury, and great wrath.
c49952	I will strike down the residents of this city, both man and beast.
c49953	They will die in a terrible plague.
c49954	After that,
c49955	declares the LORD,
c49956	I will hand over King Zedekiah of Judah, his officers, and the people
c49957	in this city who survive the plague and sword and famine,
c49958	to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and to their enemies who seek their lives.
c49959	He will put them to the sword;
c49960	he will not spare them
c49961	[or] show pity
c49962	[or] compassion.’
c49963	You are also to say to this people,
c49964	‘This is what the LORD says:
c49965	Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
c49966	Whoever stays in this city
c49967	will die by sword and famine and plague,
c49968	but whoever goes out
c49969	and surrenders to the Chaldeans
c49970	who besiege you
c49971	will live
c49972	and retain his life like a spoil of war.
c49973	For I have set My face against this city to bring disaster
c49974	and not good,
c49975	declares the LORD.
c49976	It will be handed over to the king of Babylon,
c49977	who will destroy it with fire.’
c49978	Moreover, [say] to the house of the king of Judah:
c49979	Hear the word of the LORD!
c49980	O house of David,
c49981	this is what the LORD says:
c49982	‘Administer justice every morning,
c49983	and rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor,
c49984	or My wrath will go forth like fire
c49985	and burn
c49986	with none to extinguish it
c49987	because of their evil deeds.
c49988	Behold, I am against you, [Jerusalem],
c49989	you who sit above the valley,
c49990	atop the rocky plateau—
c49991	declares the LORD—
c49992	you who say,
c49993	“Who can come against us?
c49994	Who can enter our habitations?”
c49995	I will punish you as your deeds deserve,
c49996	declares the LORD.
c49997	I will kindle a fire in your forest
c49998	that will consume everything around you.’”
c49999	This is what the LORD says:
c50000	“Go down to the palace of the king of Judah
c50001	and proclaim this message there,
c50002	saying,
c50003	‘Hear the word of the LORD,
c50004	O king of Judah,
c50005	who sits on the throne of David—
c50006	you and your officials and your people
c50007	who enter these gates.
c50008	This is what the LORD says:
c50009	Administer justice and righteousness.
c50010	Rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor.
c50011	Do no wrong ... to the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow.
c50012	or violence ... Do not
c50013	shed innocent blood in this place.
c50014	For if you will indeed carry out these commands,
c50015	then kings ... will enter through the gates of this palace
c50016	who sit on David’s throne
c50017	riding on chariots and horses—
c50018	they and their officials and their people.
c50019	But if you do not obey these words,
c50020	then I swear by Myself,
c50021	declares the LORD,
c50022	that this house will become a pile of rubble.’”
c50023	For this is what the LORD says concerning the house of the king of Judah:
c50024	“You are like Gilead to Me,
c50025	like the summit of Lebanon;
c50026	but I will certainly turn you into a desert,
c50027	like cities
c50028	that are uninhabited.
c50029	I will appoint destroyers against you, each man with his weapons,
c50030	and they will cut down the choicest of your cedars
c50031	and throw them into the fire.
c50032	And many nations will pass by this city
c50033	and ask
c50034	one another,
c50035	‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this great city?’
c50036	Then [people] will reply,
c50037	‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God
c50038	and have worshiped ... other gods.’
c50039	and served
c50040	Do not weep for the dead [king];
c50041	do not mourn his loss.
c50042	Weep bitterly for the one who is exiled,
c50043	for he will never return
c50044	to see his native land.
c50045	For this is what the LORD says concerning Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah,
c50046	who succeeded his father Josiah
c50047	[but] has gone forth from this place:
c50048	‘He will never return,
c50049	but ... in the place
c50050	to which he was exiled;
c50051	he will die
c50052	he will never see this land again.’”
c50053	“Woe
c50054	to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness,
c50055	and his upper rooms without justice,
c50056	who makes his countrymen serve without pay,
c50057	and will not give him his wages,
c50058	who says,
c50059	‘I will build myself a great palace, with spacious upper rooms.’
c50060	So he cuts windows in it,
c50061	panels it with cedar,
c50062	and paints it with vermilion.
c50063	Are you a king
c50064	because you excel in cedar?
c50065	your father
c50066	Did not ... eat
c50067	and drink
c50068	and administer justice and righteousness?
c50069	Then it went well with him.
c50070	He took up the cause of the poor and needy,
c50071	and so it went well.
c50072	Is this not what it means to know Me?”
c50073	declares the LORD.
c50074	“But your eyes and heart [are set on] nothing
c50075	except your own dishonest gain, ... innocent blood,
c50076	on shedding
c50077	extortion and oppression.”
c50078	on practicing
c50079	Therefore,
c50080	this is what the LORD says concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
c50081	“They will not mourn for him:
c50082	‘Alas, my brother!
c50083	Alas, my sister!’
c50084	They will not mourn for him:
c50085	‘Alas, for the master!
c50086	Alas, for his splendor!’
c50087	He will be buried like a donkey,
c50088	dragged away
c50089	and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.
c50090	Go up to Lebanon
c50091	and cry out;
c50092	raise your voice in Bashan;
c50093	cry out from Abarim,
c50094	for all your lovers have been crushed.
c50095	I warned you when you were secure.
c50096	You said,
c50097	‘I will not listen.’
c50098	This has been your way from youth,
c50099	that you have not you obeyed My voice.
c50100	The wind will drive away all your shepherds,
c50101	and your lovers will go into captivity.
c50102	Then you will be ashamed
c50103	and humiliated because of all your wickedness.
c50104	O inhabitant of Lebanon,
c50105	nestled in the cedars,
c50106	how you will groan
c50107	when pangs of anguish come upon you,
c50108	agony like a woman in labor.”
c50109	“As surely as I live,”
c50110	declares the LORD,
c50111	“even if you, Coniah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on My right hand,
c50112	I would pull you off.
c50113	And I will hand you over ... who want to take your life—
c50114	to those you dread,
c50115	to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans.
c50116	I will hurl you and the mother
c50117	who gave you birth
c50118	into another land,
c50119	where neither of you were born— and there
c50120	you will both die.
c50121	to the land
c50122	for which [you] long.”
c50124	[You] will never return
c50125	Is this man Coniah a despised [and] shattered pot,
c50126	a jar
c50127	that no one wants?
c50128	Why are he and his descendants hurled out
c50129	and cast into a land
c50130	they do not know?
c50131	O land, land, land,
c50132	hear the word of the LORD!
c50133	This is what the LORD says:
c50134	“Enroll this man as childless,
c50135	a man
c50136	who will not prosper in his lifetime.
c50137	None of his descendants will prosper
c50138	to sit on the throne of David
c50139	or to rule again in Judah.”
c50140	“Woe to the shepherds
c50141	who destroy
c50142	and scatter the sheep of My pasture!”
c50143	declares the LORD.
c50144	Therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the shepherds
c50145	who tend My people:
c50146	“You have scattered My flock
c50147	and driven them away,
c50148	and have not attended to them.
c50149	Behold, I will attend to you for the evil of your deeds,
c50150	declares the LORD.
c50151	Then I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock from all the lands
c50152	to which I have banished them,
c50153	and I will return them to their pasture,
c50154	where they will be fruitful
c50155	and multiply.
c50156	I will raise up shepherds over them
c50157	who will tend them,
c50158	and they will no longer be afraid
c50159	or dismayed, nor
c50160	will any go missing,
c50161	declares the LORD.
c50162	Behold, the days are coming,
c50163	declares the LORD,
c50164	when I will raise up for David a Righteous Branch,
c50165	and He will reign ... as king
c50166	wisely
c50167	and administer justice and righteousness in the land.
c50168	In His days Judah will be saved,
c50169	and Israel will dwell securely.
c50170	And this is His name
c50171	by which He will be called:
c50172	The LORD Our Righteousness.
c50173	So behold, [the] days are coming,
c50174	declares the LORD,
c50175	when they will no longer say,
c50176	‘As surely as the LORD lives,
c50177	who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.’
c50178	Instead, [they will say],
c50179	‘As surely as the LORD lives,
c50180	who brought
c50181	and led the descendants of the house of Israel from the land of the north and from all the other countries to which
c50182	I had banished them.’
c50183	They will dwell once more in their own land.”
c50184	As for the prophets:
c50185	My heart is broken within me,
c50186	and all my bones tremble.
c50187	I have become like a drunkard, like a man
c50188	overcome by wine,
c50189	because of the LORD, because of His holy words.
c50190	For the land is full of adulterers—
c50191	because of the curse the land mourns,
c50192	and the pastures of the wilderness have dried up—
c50193	their course is evil
c50194	and their power is misused.
c50195	“For both prophet and priest are ungodly;
c50196	even in My house I have found their wickedness,”
c50197	declares the LORD.
c50198	“Therefore their path will become slick; ... into the gloom
c50199	they will be driven away
c50200	and fall into it.
c50201	For I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment,”
c50202	declares the LORD.
c50203	“Among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing:
c50204	They prophesied by Baal
c50205	and led My people Israel astray.
c50206	And among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing:
c50207	They commit adultery
c50208	and walk in lies.
c50209	They strengthen the hands of evildoers,
c50210	so that no ... turns his back
c50211	one ... on wickedness.
c50212	They are all like Sodom to Me;
c50213	the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.”
c50214	Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts says concerning the prophets:
c50215	“I will feed them wormwood
c50216	and give them poisoned water to drink,
c50217	for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.”
c50218	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c50219	“Do not listen to the words of the prophets
c50220	who prophesy to you.
c50221	They are filling you with false hopes.
c50222	They speak visions from their own minds,
c50223	not from the mouth of the LORD.
c50224	They keep saying to those who despise Me,
c50225	‘The LORD says that
c50226	you will have peace,’
c50227	to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart,
c50228	[and]
c50229	‘No harm will come to you.’
c50230	But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD
c50231	to see
c50232	and hear His word?
c50233	Who has given heed to His word
c50234	and obeyed it?
c50235	Behold, the storm of the LORD
c50236	has gone out in fury,
c50237	a whirlwind
c50238	swirling down upon the heads of the wicked.
c50239	The anger of the LORD will not diminish
c50240	until He has fully accomplished
c50241	the purposes of His heart.
c50242	In the days to come you will understand it clearly.
c50243	I did not send these prophets,
c50244	yet they have run with their message;
c50245	I did not speak to them,
c50246	yet they prophesied.
c50247	But if they had stood in My council,
c50248	they would have proclaimed My words to My people
c50249	and turned them back from their evil ways and evil deeds.”
c50250	“Am I [only] a God nearby,”
c50251	declares the LORD,
c50252	“and not a God far away?”
c50253	“Can a man hide in secret places
c50254	where I cannot see him?”
c50255	declares the LORD.
c50256	“Do I not fill the heavens and earth?”
c50257	declares the LORD.
c50258	“I have heard
c50259	the sayings of the prophets
c50260	who prophesy lies in My name:
c50262	‘I had a dream!
c50263	I had a dream!’
c50264	How long
c50265	will this continue in the hearts of these prophets who prophesy falsehood, these prophets of the delusion of their own minds?
c50266	They suppose
c50267	the dreams ... will make My people forget My name,
c50268	that they tell
c50269	one another
c50270	just as their fathers forgot My name through the worship of Baal.
c50271	Let the prophet
c50272	who has a dream
c50273	retell [it],
c50275	but let him who has My word
c50276	speak [it] truthfully.
c50277	For what is straw compared to grain?
c50278	declares the LORD.
c50279	Is not My word
c50280	like fire,
c50281	declares the LORD,
c50282	and like a hammer
c50283	that smashes a rock?”
c50284	“Therefore behold,” ... “I am against the prophets
c50285	declares the LORD,
c50286	who steal from each other words [they attribute] to Me.”
c50287	“Yes,” ... “I am against the prophets
c50288	declares the LORD,
c50289	who wag their own tongues
c50290	and proclaim, ‘[The Lord] declares [it].’”
c50291	“Indeed,” ... “I am against those who prophesy false dreams
c50292	declares the LORD,
c50293	they tell
c50294	to lead My people astray with their reckless lies.
c50295	It was not I who sent
c50296	or commanded them, and they are of no
c50297	benefit at all to these people,”
c50298	declares the LORD.
c50299	“Now when this people, or a prophet or a priest, asks you,
c50300	you are to say
c50301	‘What is the oracle of the LORD?’
c50302	to them:
c50303	‘What oracle?
c50304	I will forsake you,
c50305	declares the LORD.’
c50306	As for the prophet [or] priest [or] anyone
c50307	who claims,
c50308	‘This is the oracle of the LORD,’
c50309	I will punish that man and his household.
c50310	This is what ... is to say
c50311	each man ... to his friend
c50312	and to his brother:
c50313	‘What has the LORD answered?’
c50314	or, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
c50315	But no longer refer to the oracle of the LORD,
c50316	for each man’s word becomes the oracle,
c50317	so that you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of Hosts, our God.
c50318	Thus you are to say to the prophet:
c50319	‘What has the LORD answered you?’
c50320	and, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
c50321	But if
c50322	‘This is the oracle of the LORD,’
c50323	you claim,
c50324	then this is what the LORD says:
c50325	Because you have said,
c50326	‘This is the oracle of the LORD,’
c50327	and I specifically told
c50329	you not to make this claim,
c50331	therefore I will surely
c50332	forget you
c50333	and cast you ... both you and the city
c50334	that I gave to you and your fathers.
c50335	out of My presence,
c50336	And I will bring upon you everlasting shame and perpetual humiliation
c50337	that will never be forgotten.”
c50338	the LORD showed
c50339	me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the LORD.
c50340	After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, the officials of Judah, and the craftsmen and metalsmiths from Jerusalem,
c50341	and had brought them to Babylon,
c50342	One basket [had] very good figs, like those that ripen early,
c50343	but the other basket contained very poor figs,
c50344	so bad they could not be eaten.
c50345	the LORD asked,
c50346	“what do you see?”
c50347	“Jeremiah,”
c50348	I replied.
c50349	“Figs!”
c50350	“The good figs are very good,
c50351	but the bad figs are very bad,
c50352	so bad they cannot be eaten.”
c50353	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c50354	saying,
c50355	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c50356	‘Like these good figs,
c50357	so I regard ... the exiles from Judah,
c50358	whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
c50359	as good
c50360	I will keep My eyes upon their good
c50361	and will return them to this land.
c50362	I will build them up
c50363	and not tear [them] down;
c50364	I will plant
c50365	them and not uproot them.
c50366	I will give them a heart
c50367	to know Me,
c50368	that I am the LORD.
c50369	They will be My people,
c50370	and I will be their God,
c50371	for they will return to Me with all their heart.
c50372	But like the bad figs,
c50373	so bad they cannot be eaten,
c50374	says the LORD,
c50375	so I will deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem—
c50376	those remaining in this land
c50377	and those living in the land of Egypt.
c50378	I will make them a horror and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth,
c50379	a disgrace, an object of scorn, ridicule, and cursing, wherever
c50380	I have banished them.
c50381	And I will send the sword, famine, and plague
c50382	against them, until they have perished from the land
c50383	I gave to them and their fathers.’”
c50384	This is the word
c50385	that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah,
c50386	which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
c50387	So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem
c50388	as follows:
c50389	“From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day—
c50390	twenty-three years—
c50391	the word of the LORD has come to me,
c50392	and I have spoken to you
c50393	again
c50394	and again,
c50395	but you have not listened.
c50396	And the LORD has sent all His servants the prophets to you
c50397	again
c50398	and again,
c50399	but you have not listened
c50400	[or] inclined your ear
c50401	to hear.
c50402	[The prophets] told [you],
c50403	‘Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and evil deeds,
c50404	and you can dwell in the land
c50405	that the LORD has given to you and to your fathers forever and ever.
c50406	Do not follow other gods
c50407	to serve
c50408	them and to worship them,
c50409	and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands.
c50410	Then I will do you no harm.’
c50411	you have not listened to Me,’
c50412	declares the LORD,
c50413	‘But to your own harm, ... ‘so you have provoked Me to anger with the works of your hands.’
c50414	Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c50415	‘Because you have not obeyed My words,
c50416	behold, I will summon
c50417	all the families of the north,
c50418	declares the LORD,
c50419	and [I will send for] My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
c50420	I will bring them against this land, against its residents, and against all the surrounding nations.
c50421	So I will completely destroy
c50422	them and make them an object of horror and contempt, an everlasting desolation.
c50423	Moreover, I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
c50424	And this whole land will become a desolate wasteland,
c50425	and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
c50426	But when
c50427	seventy years are complete,
c50428	I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,
c50429	declares the LORD,
c50430	for their guilt,
c50431	the land of the Chaldeans,
c50432	and I will make it an everlasting desolation.
c50433	I will bring upon that land all the words
c50434	I have pronounced against it, ... which
c50435	all that is written in this book,
c50436	Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
c50437	For many nations and great kings will enslave them,
c50438	and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.’”
c50439	This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me:
c50440	“Take from My hand this cup of the wine of wrath,
c50441	and make all the nations ... drink from it.
c50442	to whom I send you
c50443	And they will drink
c50444	and stagger
c50445	and go out of their minds, because of the sword
c50446	that I will send among them.”
c50447	So I took the cup from the LORD’s hand
c50448	and made all the nations drink from it,
c50449	each one to whom the LORD had sent me,
c50450	Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials;
c50451	to make them a ruin, an object of horror and contempt and cursing, as they are this day—
c50452	Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officials, his leaders, and all his people;
c50453	all the mixed tribes; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines: Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
c50454	Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;
c50455	all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands
c50456	across the sea;
c50457	Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners [of their hair];
c50458	all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed tribes
c50459	who dwell in the desert;
c50460	all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media;
c50461	all the kings of the north, both near and far,
c50462	one after another—
c50463	all the kingdoms
c50464	on the face of the earth.
c50465	And after all of them, the king of Sheshach will drink [it too].
c50466	Then you are to tell them,
c50467	‘This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c50468	Drink,
c50469	get drunk,
c50470	and vomit.
c50471	Fall down
c50472	and never get up again, because of the sword
c50473	I will send among you.’
c50475	If they refuse
c50476	to take the cup from your hand
c50477	[and] drink it,
c50478	you are to tell them,
c50479	‘This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c50480	You most certainly must drink it!
c50481	For behold, ... on the city
c50482	that bears My name, ... am calling down ... against
c50483	I am beginning
c50484	to bring disaster
c50485	so how could you possibly go unpunished?
c50486	You will not go unpunished,
c50487	for I ... a sword ... all the inhabitants of the earth,
c50488	declares the LORD of Hosts.’
c50489	So you are to prophesy all these words against them
c50490	and say to them:
c50491	‘The LORD will roar from on high;
c50492	He will raise His voice from His holy habitation.
c50493	He will roar loudly over His pasture;
c50494	like those who tread the grapes, He will call out with a shout, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
c50495	The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth
c50496	because the LORD brings a charge against the nations.
c50497	He enters into judgment on all mankind
c50498	the wicked
c50499	and puts ... to the sword,’
c50500	declares the LORD.”
c50501	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c50502	“Behold! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation;
c50503	a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth.”
c50504	Those slain by the LORD on that day will be spread from [one] end of the earth to the other.
c50505	They will not be mourned,
c50506	gathered,
c50507	or buried.
c50508	They will be like dung lying on the ground.
c50509	Wail,
c50510	you shepherds,
c50511	and cry out;
c50512	roll in the dust,
c50513	you leaders of the flock.
c50514	For the days ... have come;
c50515	of your slaughter
c50516	and be shattered
c50517	you will fall ... like fine pottery.
c50518	Flight will evade the shepherds,
c50519	and escape [will elude] the leaders of the flock.
c50520	Hear the cry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock,
c50521	for the LORD is destroying their pasture.
c50522	The peaceful meadows will become lifeless because of the LORD’s burning anger.
c50523	He has left His den like a lion,
c50524	for their land has been made a desolation by the sword of the oppressor, and because of His fierce anger.
c50525	At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came from the LORD:
c50527	“This is what the LORD says:
c50528	Stand in the courtyard of the LORD’s house
c50529	and speak all ... the cities of Judah
c50530	who come
c50531	to worship there.
c50532	the words ... all
c50533	I have commanded
c50534	you to speak to
c50535	Do not omit a word.
c50536	Perhaps they will listen
c50537	and turn— each from his evil way of life—
c50538	so that I may relent of the disaster
c50539	that I am planning
c50540	to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.
c50541	And you are to tell them that
c50542	this is what the LORD says:
c50543	If you do not listen to Me
c50544	and walk in My law,
c50545	which I set before you,
c50546	and [if you do not] listen to the words of My servants the prophets,
c50547	whom I have sent you
c50548	again
c50549	and again
c50550	even though you did not listen,
c50551	then I will make this house like Shiloh,
c50552	and I will make this city an object of cursing among all the nations of the earth.”
c50553	The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah
c50554	speaking these words in the house of the LORD,
c50555	and as soon as
c50556	[he] had finished
c50557	telling all
c50558	what the LORD had commanded
c50559	the people ... him to say, ... and all
c50560	the priests and prophets ... the people seized him,
c50561	shouting,
c50562	“You must surely die!
c50563	How dare you prophesy in the name of the LORD
c50564	that
c50565	this house will become like Shiloh
c50566	and this city will be desolate and deserted!”
c50567	And all the people assembled against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
c50568	When the officials of Judah heard these things,
c50569	they went up from the king’s palace to the house of the LORD
c50570	and sat at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD’s [house].
c50571	Then the priests and prophets said to the officials and all the people, ... against
c50573	“This man [is] worthy of death,
c50574	for he has prophesied ... this city,
c50575	as you have heard with your own ears!”
c50576	And Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people, ... against ... all
c50578	“The LORD sent
c50579	me to prophesy ... this house and against this city ... the words
c50580	that you have heard.
c50581	So now,
c50582	correct your ways and deeds
c50583	and obey the voice of the LORD your God,
c50584	so that He might relent of the disaster
c50585	that He has pronounced against you.
c50586	As for me,
c50587	here I am in your hands;
c50588	do to me what you think is good and right.
c50589	But know for certain
c50590	that
c50591	if you put me to death,
c50592	you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, on this city, and on its residents; for
c50593	truly the LORD has sent
c50594	me to speak all these words in your hearing.”
c50595	Then the officials and all the people told the priests and prophets, ... to
c50596	“This man [is] not worthy of death,
c50597	for he has spoken ... us in the name of the LORD our God!”
c50598	Some of the elders of the land stood up
c50599	and said to the whole assembly of the people,
c50601	“Micah the Moreshite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah
c50602	and told all the people of Judah
c50603	says:
c50604	that this is what the LORD of Hosts
c50605	‘Zion will be plowed like a field,
c50606	Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,
c50607	and the temple mount a wooded ridge.’
c50608	Did Hezekiah king of Judah [or] anyone else in Judah put him to death?
c50609	Did [Hezekiah] not fear the LORD
c50610	and seek [His] favor,
c50611	and did not the LORD relent of the disaster
c50612	He had pronounced against them?
c50613	But we are about to bring great harm on ourselves!”
c50614	Now there was another man prophesying in the name of the LORD,
c50615	Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim.
c50616	He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like all those of Jeremiah.
c50617	King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and officials heard his words,
c50618	and the king sought
c50619	to put him to death.
c50620	But when Uriah found out about it,
c50621	in fear
c50622	he fled
c50623	and went to Egypt.
c50624	Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt:
c50625	Elnathan son of Achbor along with some other men.
c50626	They brought Uriah out of Egypt
c50627	and took him to King Jehoiakim,
c50628	who struck him down with the sword
c50629	and threw his body into the burial place of the common people.
c50630	Nevertheless, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah,
c50631	so he was not handed over to the people
c50632	to be put to death.
c50633	At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
c50635	“This is what the LORD said to me:
c50636	Make for yourself a yoke out of leather straps
c50637	and put it on your neck.
c50638	Send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through the envoys ... to
c50639	who have come to Jerusalem ... Zedekiah king of Judah.
c50640	Give them a message for their masters
c50641	declaring that
c50642	this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says
c50643	that you are to tell [them]:
c50644	I made the earth and the men and beasts
c50645	on the face of [it],
c50646	By My great power and outstretched arm,
c50647	and I give it
c50648	to whom I please.
c50649	So now
c50650	I have placed all these lands under the authority of My servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.
c50651	I have even made the beasts of the field
c50652	subject to him.
c50653	All nations will serve him and his son and grandson,
c50654	until the time of his own land comes;
c50655	then many nations and great kings will enslave him.
c50657	As for the nation or kingdom
c50658	that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
c50659	and does not place its neck under [his] yoke,
c50660	I will punish that nation by sword and famine and plague,
c50661	declares the LORD,
c50662	until I have destroyed it by his hand.
c50663	But as for you,
c50664	do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums, or your sorcerers ... you,
c50665	who tell
c50667	‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon.’
c50668	For they prophesy to you a lie
c50669	that will serve to remove you from your land;
c50670	I will banish you
c50671	and you will perish.
c50672	But the nation
c50673	that will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon
c50674	and serve him,
c50675	I will leave it in its own land,
c50676	declares the LORD.”
c50677	to cultivate it
c50678	and reside in it,
c50679	And to Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke the same message:
c50681	“Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon;
c50682	serve him and his people,
c50683	and live!
c50684	Why should you and your people die by the sword, famine, and plague,
c50685	as the LORD has decreed against any nation
c50686	that does not serve the king of Babylon?
c50687	Do not listen to the words of the prophets
c50688	who tell you,
c50690	‘You must not serve the king of Babylon,’
c50691	for they are prophesying to you a lie.
c50692	‘For I have not sent them,’
c50693	declares the LORD,
c50694	‘and yet they are prophesying falsely in My name;
c50695	therefore I will banish you
c50696	and you will perish— you and the prophets
c50697	who prophesy to you.’”
c50698	Then I said to the priests and all this people, ... to
c50700	“This is what the LORD says:
c50701	Do not listen ... the words of your prophets
c50702	who prophesy to you,
c50703	saying,
c50704	‘Look, very soon now the articles of the LORD’s temple will be brought back from Babylon.’
c50705	They are prophesying to you a lie.
c50706	Do not listen to them.
c50707	Serve the king of Babylon
c50708	and live!
c50709	Why should this city become a ruin?
c50710	If they are indeed prophets
c50711	and the word of the LORD is with them,
c50712	let them now plead with the LORD of Hosts
c50713	that the articles ... not be taken
c50714	remaining in the house of the LORD, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem,
c50715	to Babylon.
c50716	For this is what the LORD of Hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the bases, and the rest of the articles
c50717	that still remain in this city,
c50718	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take
c50719	when he carried Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah {into exile} from Jerusalem to Babylon,
c50720	along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.
c50721	Yes, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about the articles
c50722	that remain in the house of the LORD, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
c50723	‘They will be carried to Babylon
c50724	and will remain there until the day
c50725	I attend to them again,’
c50726	declares the LORD.
c50727	‘Then I will bring them back
c50728	and restore them to this place.’”
c50729	of that same year, ... near the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah,
c50730	In the fifth month ... the fourth year, ... the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur ... said to me
c50731	of Gibeon,
c50732	in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people:
c50734	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c50736	‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
c50737	Within two years I will restore to this place all the articles of the house of the LORD
c50738	that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon removed from here
c50739	and carried to Babylon.
c50740	Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, along with all the exiles from Judah
c50741	who went to Babylon,’
c50742	And I will restore to this place
c50743	declares the LORD,
c50744	‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”
c50745	Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people
c50746	who were standing in the temple of the LORD.
c50747	Jeremiah said.
c50748	“Amen!”
c50749	“May the LORD do so!
c50750	May the LORD fulfill the words
c50751	you have prophesied,
c50752	and may He restore the articles of [His] house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.
c50753	Nevertheless, listen now to this message
c50754	I am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
c50755	The prophets
c50756	of old who preceded you and me
c50757	prophesied war, disaster, and plague against many lands and great kingdoms.
c50758	As for the prophet
c50759	who prophesies peace,
c50760	only if the word of the prophet comes true
c50761	will the prophet be recognized
c50762	as one the LORD has truly sent.”
c50763	Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet
c50764	and broke it.
c50765	And in the presence of all the people Hananiah proclaimed,
c50766	says:
c50767	“This is what the LORD
c50768	‘In this way, within two years I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon off the neck of all the nations.’”
c50769	At this, Jeremiah the prophet went on his way.
c50770	the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
c50771	But shortly after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke off [his] neck,
c50773	“Go
c50774	and tell Hananiah
c50775	says:
c50776	that this is what the LORD
c50777	‘You have broken a yoke of wood,
c50778	but in its place you have fashioned a yoke of iron.’
c50779	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c50780	‘I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations
c50781	to make them serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon,
c50782	and they will serve him.
c50783	I have even given him control of the beasts of the field.’”
c50784	Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah,
c50785	“Listen,
c50786	Hananiah!
c50787	The LORD did not send you,
c50788	but you have persuaded this people to trust in a lie.
c50789	Therefore, this is what the LORD says:
c50790	‘I am about to remove you from the face of the earth.
c50791	You will die this year
c50792	because you have preached rebellion against the LORD.’”
c50793	And in the seventh month of that very year, the prophet Hananiah died.
c50794	This is the text of the letter
c50795	that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders among the exiles, the priests, the prophets, and all the others
c50796	Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
c50797	(This was after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the court officials, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metalsmiths had been exiled from Jerusalem.)
c50798	The letter was entrusted to Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah,
c50799	whom Zedekiah king of Judah had sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon.
c50800	It stated:
c50801	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles
c50802	I carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
c50803	‘Build houses
c50804	and settle down.
c50805	Plant gardens
c50806	and eat their produce.
c50807	Take wives
c50808	and have sons and daughters.
c50809	Take wives for your sons
c50810	and give your daughters in marriage,
c50811	so that they too may have sons and daughters.
c50812	Multiply there;
c50813	do not decrease.
c50814	Seek the prosperity of the city
c50815	to which I have sent you as exiles.
c50816	Pray to the LORD on its behalf,
c50817	for if it prospers, you too will prosper.’
c50818	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c50819	‘Do not be deceived by the prophets
c50820	among you,
c50821	and diviners
c50822	and do not listen to the dreams
c50823	you elicit from them.
c50824	For they are falsely prophesying to you in My name;
c50825	I have not sent them,
c50826	declares the LORD.’”
c50827	For this is what the LORD says:
c50828	“When
c50829	Babylon’s seventy years are complete,
c50830	I will attend to you
c50831	and confirm My promise
c50832	to restore you to this place.
c50833	For I know the plans
c50834	I have for you,
c50835	declares the LORD,
c50836	plans to prosper you
c50837	and not to harm you,
c50838	to give you a future and a hope.
c50839	Then you will call upon Me
c50840	and come
c50841	and pray to Me,
c50842	and I will listen to you.
c50843	You will seek Me
c50844	and find Me
c50845	when you search for Me with all your heart.
c50846	I will be found by you,
c50847	declares the LORD,
c50848	and I will restore you from captivity
c50849	and gather you from all the nations and places
c50850	to which I have banished you,
c50851	declares the LORD.
c50852	I will restore you to the place
c50853	from which I sent you into exile.”
c50854	Because you may say,
c50855	“The LORD has raised up for us prophets in Babylon,”
c50856	this is what the LORD says about the king
c50857	who sits on David’s throne
c50858	and all the people
c50859	who remain in this city,
c50860	your brothers
c50861	who did not go with you into exile.
c50862	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c50863	“I will send against them sword, famine, and plague,
c50864	and I will make them like rotten figs,
c50865	so bad that they cannot be eaten.
c50866	I will pursue them with sword, famine, and plague.
c50867	I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth—
c50868	a curse, a desolation, and an object of scorn and reproach among all the nations
c50869	to which I banish them.
c50870	I will do this because they have not listened to My words,
c50871	declares the LORD,
c50872	which I sent to them ... with My servants the prophets.
c50873	time and again
c50875	And neither have you [exiles] listened,
c50876	declares the LORD.
c50877	So hear the word of the LORD,
c50878	all you exiles
c50879	I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
c50880	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah,
c50881	who are prophesying to you lies in My name:
c50882	“I will deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
c50883	and he will kill them before your very eyes.
c50884	Because of them, all the exiles of Judah ... will use this curse:
c50885	who are in Babylon
c50887	‘May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab,
c50888	whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire!’
c50889	For they have committed an outrage in Israel
c50890	by committing adultery with the wives of their neighbors
c50891	and speaking lies in My name,
c50892	which I did not command them [to do].
c50893	I
c50894	am He who knows,
c50895	and I am a witness,
c50896	declares the LORD.
c50897	You are to say to Shemaiah the Nehelamite,
c50899	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c50900	saying:
c50901	In your own name you have sent out letters to all the people
c50902	of Jerusalem,
c50903	to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests,
c50905	‘The LORD has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada,
c50906	to be the chief officer in the house of the LORD, responsible for any madman who acts like a prophet—
c50907	you must put him in stocks and neck irons.
c50908	So now,
c50909	why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth,
c50910	who poses as a prophet among you?
c50911	For he has sent to us [in] Babylon,
c50912	claiming:
c50913	The exile will be long.
c50914	So build houses
c50915	and settle down;
c50916	plant gardens
c50917	and eat their produce.’”
c50918	And Zephaniah the priest read this letter [to] Jeremiah the prophet.
c50919	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
c50921	“Send a message to all the exiles:
c50923	This is what the LORD says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite.
c50924	Because Shemaiah prophesied to you,
c50925	though I did not send him,
c50926	and made you trust in a lie,
c50927	this is what the LORD says:
c50928	Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants.
c50929	He will have no one
c50930	left among this people,
c50931	nor will he see the good
c50932	that I bring to My people,
c50933	declares the LORD,
c50934	for he has preached rebellion against the LORD.”
c50935	This is the word
c50936	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
c50938	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c50940	‘Write ... all the words
c50941	that I have spoken
c50942	in a book ... to you.
c50943	For behold, the days are coming,
c50944	declares the LORD,
c50945	when I will restore from captivity My people Israel and Judah,
c50946	declares the LORD.
c50947	I will restore them to the land
c50948	I gave to their forefathers,
c50949	and they will possess it.’”
c50950	These are the words
c50951	the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah.
c50952	Yes, this is what the LORD says:
c50953	“We have heard a cry of panic—
c50954	of terror,
c50955	not of peace.
c50956	Ask
c50957	and see:
c50958	Can a male give birth?
c50959	Why then do I see every man
c50960	with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor
c50961	and every face turned pale?
c50962	awful
c50963	How ... that day will be!
c50964	None will be like it!
c50965	It is the time of Jacob’s distress,
c50966	but he will be delivered out of it.
c50967	On that day,
c50968	declares the LORD of Hosts,
c50969	I will break the yoke off their necks
c50970	and tear off their bonds,
c50971	and no longer will strangers enslave them.
c50972	Instead, they will serve the LORD their God and David their king,
c50973	whom I will raise up for them.
c50974	As for you,
c50975	do not be afraid,
c50976	My servant Jacob,
c50977	declares the LORD,
c50978	and do not be dismayed,
c50979	O Israel;
c50980	for I will surely deliver you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their captivity!
c50981	Jacob will return
c50982	to quiet
c50983	and ease,
c50984	with no one to frighten him.
c50985	For I [am] with you
c50986	declares the LORD.
c50987	to save you,
c50988	Though I will completely destroy all the nations
c50989	to which I have scattered you,
c50990	I will not completely destroy you;
c50991	yet I will correct you in measure,
c50992	and I will by no means leave you unpunished.”
c50993	For this is what the LORD says:
c50994	“Your injury is incurable;
c50995	your wound [is] grievous.
c50996	[There is] no one to plead your cause, no
c50997	remedy for your sores, ... recovery
c50998	no ... for you.
c50999	All your lovers have forgotten
c51000	you; they no longer seek you,
c51001	for I have struck you as an enemy would,
c51002	with the discipline of someone cruel,
c51003	because of your great iniquity
c51004	and numerous sins.
c51005	Why do you cry out over your wound?
c51006	Your pain has no cure!
c51007	Because of your great iniquity
c51008	and numerous sins
c51009	I have done these things to you.
c51010	Nevertheless, all who devour you will be devoured,
c51011	and all your adversaries—
c51012	every one of them— will go off into exile.
c51013	Those who plundered you will be plundered,
c51014	and all who raided you will be raided.
c51015	But I will restore your health
c51016	and heal your wounds,
c51017	declares the LORD,
c51018	because they call you an outcast,
c51019	Zion, for whom
c51020	no one cares.”
c51021	This is what the LORD says:
c51022	“I will restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents
c51023	and have compassion on his dwellings.
c51024	And the city will be rebuilt on her own ruins,
c51025	and the palace will stand in its rightful place.
c51026	Thanksgiving will proceed from them, a sound of celebration.
c51027	I will multiply them,
c51028	and they will not be decreased;
c51029	I will honor them,
c51030	and they will not be belittled.
c51031	Their children will be as in days of old,
c51032	and their congregation will be established before Me.
c51033	And I will punish all their oppressors.
c51034	Their leader will be one of their own,
c51035	and their ruler will arise from their midst.
c51036	And I will bring him near,
c51037	and he will approach Me,
c51038	for who
c51039	would dare on his own
c51040	to approach Me?
c51041	declares the LORD.
c51042	And you will be My people,
c51043	and I will be your God.”
c51044	Behold, the tempest of the LORD—
c51045	wrath has gone forth—
c51046	a churning storm!
c51047	It will swirl about the heads of the wicked.
c51048	The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back
c51049	until He has fully accomplished
c51050	the purposes of His heart.
c51051	In the days to come you will understand this.
c51052	“At that time,”
c51053	declares the LORD,
c51054	“I will be the God of all the families of Israel,
c51055	and they will be My people.”
c51056	This is what the LORD says:
c51057	“The people who survived the sword found favor in the wilderness
c51058	went
c51059	to find rest.”
c51060	when Israel
c51061	The LORD appeared to him from afar:
c51062	“I have loved you with an everlasting love;
c51063	therefore I have drawn you with loving devotion.
c51064	Again I will build you,
c51065	and you will be rebuilt,
c51066	O Virgin Israel.
c51067	Again you will take up your tambourines
c51068	and go out in joyful dancing.
c51069	Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria;
c51070	the farmers will plant
c51071	and enjoy the fruit.
c51072	For there will be a day
c51073	when watchmen will call out on the hills of Ephraim,
c51074	‘Arise,
c51075	let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God!’”
c51076	For this is what the LORD says:
c51077	“Sing with joy for Jacob;
c51078	shout for the foremost of the nations!
c51079	Make
c51080	your praises heard
c51081	and say,
c51082	save
c51083	‘O LORD,
c51084	Your people, the remnant of Israel!’
c51085	Behold, I will bring them from the land of the north
c51086	and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth,
c51087	including the blind and the lame, expectant mothers and women in labor.
c51088	They will return as a great assembly!
c51089	They will come with weeping,
c51090	and by their supplication I will lead them;
c51091	I will make them walk beside streams of waters, on a level path
c51092	where they will not stumble.
c51093	For I am Israel’s Father,
c51094	and Ephraim
c51095	is My firstborn.”
c51096	Hear, ... the word of the LORD,
c51097	O nations,
c51098	and proclaim it in distant coastlands,
c51099	saying:
c51100	“The One who scattered Israel will gather them
c51101	and keep them as a shepherd guards his flock.
c51102	For the LORD has ransomed Jacob
c51103	and redeemed him from the hand that had overpowered him.
c51104	They will come
c51105	and shout for joy on the heights of Zion;
c51106	they will be radiant in the bounty of the LORD— the grain, the new wine, the fresh oil, and the young of the flocks and herds.
c51107	Their life will be like a well-watered garden,
c51108	and never again
c51109	will they languish.
c51110	Then the maidens will rejoice with dancing,
c51111	young men and old as well.
c51112	I will turn their mourning into joy,
c51113	and give them comfort
c51114	and joy for their sorrow.
c51115	I will refresh the priests with abundance,
c51116	and My people will be filled with My bounty,”
c51117	declares the LORD.
c51118	This is what the LORD says:
c51119	“A voice is heard in Ramah,
c51120	mourning and great weeping,
c51121	Rachel
c51122	weeping for her children,
c51123	[and] refusing
c51124	consolation,
c51125	because they are no more.”
c51126	This is what the LORD says:
c51127	“Keep your voice from weeping
c51128	and your eyes from tears,
c51129	for the reward for your work will come,
c51130	declares the LORD.
c51131	Then [your children] will return from the land of the enemy.
c51132	So there is hope for your future,
c51133	declares the LORD,
c51134	and your children will return to their own land.
c51135	I have surely heard Ephraim’s
c51136	moaning:
c51137	‘You disciplined me severely,
c51138	calf.
c51139	like an untrained
c51140	Restore me,
c51141	and I will return,
c51142	for You [are] the LORD my God.
c51143	because
c51144	After I returned,
c51145	I repented;
c51147	and after I was instructed,
c51148	I struck [my thigh] in grief.
c51149	I was ashamed
c51150	and humiliated
c51151	I bore the disgrace of my youth.’
c51152	Is not Ephraim a precious son to Me,
c51153	a delightful child?
c51155	Though I often speak against him,
c51156	surely I still remember him.
c51157	Therefore My heart yearns for him;
c51158	I have great compassion for him,”
c51159	declares the LORD.
c51160	“Set up the roadmarks,
c51161	establish the signposts.
c51162	Keep the highway in mind,
c51163	the road
c51164	you have traveled.
c51165	Return,
c51166	O Virgin Israel,
c51167	return to these cities of yours.
c51168	How long will you wander,
c51169	O faithless daughter?
c51170	For the LORD has created a new thing in the land—
c51171	a woman will surround a man.”
c51172	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c51173	they will once again speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities:
c51174	“When I restore them from captivity,
c51175	‘May the LORD bless you,
c51176	O righteous dwelling place, O holy mountain.’
c51177	And Judah and all its cities will dwell together in [the land],
c51178	the farmers
c51179	and those who move with the flocks,
c51180	for I will refresh the weary soul
c51181	all
c51182	who are weak.”
c51183	and replenish
c51184	At this I awoke
c51185	and looked around.
c51186	My sleep had been most pleasant to me.
c51187	“The days are coming,”
c51188	declares the LORD,
c51189	“when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the offspring of man [and] of beast.
c51191	Just as I watched over
c51192	them to uproot
c51193	and tear them down,
c51194	to demolish,
c51195	destroy,
c51196	and bring disaster,
c51197	so will I be attentive
c51198	to build them
c51199	and to plant them,”
c51200	declares the LORD.
c51201	“In those days, it will no longer be said:
c51202	‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
c51203	and this has set the children’s teeth on edge.’
c51204	Instead, each will die for his own iniquity.
c51205	If anyone
c51206	eats the sour grapes,
c51207	his own teeth will be set on edge.
c51208	Behold, the days are coming,
c51209	declares the LORD,
c51210	when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
c51211	It will not be like the covenant
c51212	I made with their fathers when
c51213	I took them by the hand
c51214	to lead them out of Egypt—
c51215	a covenant they broke,
c51216	though I was a husband to them,”
c51217	declares the LORD.
c51218	“But this is the covenant
c51219	I will make with the house of Israel after those days,
c51220	declares the LORD.
c51221	I will put My law in their minds
c51222	and inscribe it on their hearts.
c51223	And I will be their God,
c51224	and they will be My people.
c51225	No longer ... teach
c51226	will each man ... his neighbor
c51227	[or] his brother,
c51228	saying,
c51229	‘Know the LORD,’
c51230	because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest,
c51231	declares the LORD.
c51232	For I will forgive their iniquity
c51233	and will remember their sins no more.”
c51234	Thus says the LORD,
c51235	who gives the sun for light by day
c51236	[and] orders the moon and stars for light by night,
c51237	who stirs up the sea
c51238	so that its waves roar—
c51239	the LORD of Hosts is His name:
c51240	“Only if this fixed order departed from My presence,
c51241	declares the LORD,
c51242	would Israel’s descendants ... cease
c51243	ever ... to be a nation before Me.”
c51244	This is what the LORD says:
c51245	“Only if the heavens above could be measured
c51246	and the foundations of the earth below searched out,
c51247	would I reject all of Israel’s descendants because of all
c51248	they have done,”
c51249	declares the LORD.
c51250	“Behold, the days are coming,”
c51251	declares the LORD,
c51252	“when the city will be rebuilt for [Me], from the tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
c51253	The measuring line will once again stretch out straight to the hill of Gareb
c51254	and then turn toward Goah.
c51255	The whole valley of the dead bodies and of ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley, to the corner of the Horse Gate to the east, will be holy to the LORD.
c51256	It will never ... be uprooted
c51257	again ... or demolished.”
c51258	This is the word
c51259	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah,
c51260	which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
c51261	At that time, the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem,
c51262	and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard,
c51263	which was in the palace of the king of Judah.
c51264	For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him,
c51265	saying:
c51266	“Why are you prophesying
c51267	says:
c51268	that the LORD
c51269	‘Behold, I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon,
c51270	and he will capture it.
c51271	Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the hands of the Chaldeans,
c51272	but he will surely be handed over to the king of Babylon
c51273	to speak with him face to face
c51274	and to see him eye to eye.
c51275	He will take Zedekiah to Babylon,
c51276	where he will stay
c51277	until I attend to him,
c51278	declares the LORD.
c51279	If you fight against the Chaldeans,
c51280	you will not succeed.’”
c51281	Jeremiah replied,
c51282	“The word of the LORD came to me,
c51283	saying:
c51284	Behold! Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to
c51285	you to say,
c51286	‘Buy for yourself my field
c51287	in Anathoth,
c51288	for you have the right of redemption
c51289	to buy it.’
c51290	Then, as the LORD had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard
c51291	and urged me,
c51292	‘Please buy my field
c51293	in Anathoth
c51294	in the land of Benjamin,
c51295	for you own the right of inheritance
c51296	and redemption.
c51297	Buy it for yourself.’”
c51298	Then I knew
c51299	that this was the word of the LORD.
c51300	So I bought the field ... from my cousin Hanamel,
c51301	in Anathoth
c51302	and I weighed out
c51303	seventeen shekels of silver.
c51304	I signed ... the deed,
c51305	and sealed
c51306	called in witnesses,
c51307	and weighed out the silver on the scales.
c51308	Then I took the deed of purchase— the sealed copy with its terms and conditions, as well as the open copy—
c51309	and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of my cousin Hanamel, the witnesses
c51310	who were signing the purchase agreement,
c51311	and all the Jews
c51312	sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
c51313	In their sight I instructed Baruch,
c51315	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c51316	Take these deeds— both the sealed copy and the open copy of the deed of purchase—
c51317	and put them in a clay jar
c51318	to preserve them for a long time.
c51319	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c51320	Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.”
c51321	to ... I prayed ... the LORD:
c51322	After I had given the deed of purchase ... Baruch son of Neriah, ... to
c51324	“Oh, Lord GOD!
c51325	You have made the heavens and earth by Your great power and outstretched arm.
c51326	Nothing is too difficult for You!
c51327	You show loving devotion to thousands,
c51328	but lay the sins of the fathers into the laps of their children after them,
c51329	O great ... God
c51330	and mighty
c51331	whose name is the LORD of Hosts,
c51332	the One great in counsel
c51333	and mighty in deed,
c51334	whose eyes are on all the ways of the sons of men,
c51335	to reward each one according to his ways and the fruit of his deeds.
c51336	You performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and You do so to this very day, both in Israel and among all mankind.
c51337	And You have made a name for Yourself, as is the case to this day.
c51338	You brought Your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror.
c51339	You gave them this land
c51340	You had sworn ... their forefathers,
c51341	to give
c51342	a land flowing with milk and honey.
c51343	They came in
c51344	and possessed it,
c51345	but they did not obey Your voice
c51346	or walk in Your law. They failed
c51347	all
c51348	You commanded
c51349	to perform
c51350	them to do,
c51351	and so You have brought upon them all this disaster.
c51352	See how the siege ramps are mounted against the city
c51353	to capture it.
c51354	the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans
c51355	who are fighting against it.
c51356	And by sword, famine, and plague,
c51358	What You have spoken
c51359	has happened,
c51360	as You now see!
c51361	Yet You, ... have said to me,
c51362	O Lord GOD,
c51363	‘Buy for yourself the field with silver
c51364	and call in witnesses,
c51365	even though the city has been handed over to the Chaldeans!’”
c51366	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
c51368	“Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh.
c51369	Is anything too difficult for Me?
c51370	Therefore, this is what the LORD says:
c51371	I am about to hand this city over to the Chaldeans and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
c51372	who will capture it.
c51373	And the Chaldeans ... will come in,
c51374	who are fighting against this city
c51375	set [it] on fire,
c51376	and burn it,
c51377	along with the houses
c51378	of those who ... by burning incense to Baal on their rooftops
c51379	and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.
c51380	provoked Me to anger
c51381	For the children of Israel and of Judah have done nothing but
c51382	evil in My sight
c51383	from their youth;
c51384	indeed, [they] have done nothing but provoke Me to anger by the work of their hands,
c51385	declares the LORD.
c51386	For this city has aroused My wrath and fury from the day
c51387	it was built
c51388	until now.
c51389	Therefore I will remove it from My presence
c51390	because of all the evil the children of Israel and of Judah
c51391	have done
c51392	to provoke Me to anger—
c51393	they, their kings, their officials, their priests and prophets, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem.
c51394	They have turned their backs to
c51395	Me and not their faces.
c51396	Though I taught them
c51397	again and again,
c51399	they would not listen
c51400	or respond to discipline.
c51401	They have placed their abominations in the house
c51402	that bears My name, and so
c51403	have defiled it.
c51404	They have built the high places of Baal
c51405	in the Valley of Hinnom to make their sons ... something
c51406	and daughters pass through the fire to Molech—
c51407	I never commanded them,
c51408	nor had it ever entered My mind,
c51409	that they should commit such an abomination
c51410	and cause Judah to sin.
c51411	Now
c51412	therefore, about this city ... this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c51413	of which you say,
c51414	‘It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword and famine and plague,’
c51415	I will surely gather [My people] from all the lands
c51416	to which I have banished them in My furious anger and great wrath,
c51417	and I will return them to this place
c51418	and make them dwell in safety.
c51419	They will be My people,
c51420	and I will be their God.
c51421	I will give them one heart and one way,
c51422	so that they will always fear Me
c51423	for their own good and for the good of their children after them.
c51424	I will make an everlasting covenant with them:
c51425	I will never turn away from
c51426	doing good to them,
c51427	and I will put My fear in their hearts
c51428	so that they will never turn away from Me.
c51429	Yes , I will rejoice in
c51430	doing them good,
c51431	and I will faithfully plant them in this land with all My heart and soul.
c51432	For this is what the LORD says:
c51433	Just as I have brought all this great disaster on this people,
c51434	so I will bring on them all the good
c51435	I have promised them.
c51436	And fields will be bought in this land
c51437	about which you are saying,
c51438	‘It is a desolation, without man or beast;
c51439	it has been handed over to the Chaldeans.’
c51440	Fields will be purchased with silver,
c51441	and deeds will be signed,
c51442	sealed,
c51443	and witnessed
c51444	in the land of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah— the cities of the hill country, the foothills, [and] the Negev—
c51445	because I will restore them from captivity,
c51446	declares the LORD.”
c51447	the word of the LORD came to [him] a second time:
c51448	While [Jeremiah]
c51449	was still confined in the courtyard of the guard,
c51451	“Thus says the LORD
c51452	who made the earth,
c51453	the LORD
c51454	who formed it
c51455	and established it,
c51456	the LORD is His name:
c51457	Call to Me
c51458	and I will answer
c51459	and show you great and unsearchable things
c51460	you do not know.
c51461	For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the houses of this city and the palaces of the kings of Judah
c51462	that have been torn down for defense against the siege ramps and the sword:
c51463	Those who come
c51464	to fight the Chaldeans ... with
c51465	will fill [these houses] ... the corpses of their own men,
c51466	whom I will strike down in My anger and in My wrath.
c51467	I have hidden My face from this city because of all its wickedness.
c51468	Nevertheless, I will bring to it health and healing,
c51469	and I will heal [its people]
c51470	and reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.
c51471	I will restore Judah and Israel from captivity
c51472	and will rebuild them as in former times.
c51473	And I will cleanse them from all the iniquity
c51474	they have committed against Me
c51475	and forgive all
c51476	they have committed
c51477	the wrongs ... by rebelling against Me.
c51478	So [this city] will bring Me renown, joy, praise, and glory before all the nations of the earth,
c51479	who will hear of all the good
c51480	I do for it.
c51481	in awe
c51482	They will tremble ... because of all the goodness and prosperity
c51483	I will provide it.
c51484	This is what the LORD says:
c51485	In this place ... there will be heard again
c51486	you say
c51487	is a wasteland without man [or] beast,
c51488	in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem
c51489	that are deserted— inhabited by neither man nor beast—
c51490	the sounds of joy [and] gladness, the voices of the bride [and] bridegroom,
c51491	and the voices ... saying:
c51492	‘Give thanks to the LORD of Hosts,
c51493	for the LORD is good;
c51494	His loving devotion endures forever.’
c51495	of those bringing thank offerings into the house of the LORD,
c51496	For I will restore the land from captivity as in former times,
c51497	says the LORD.
c51498	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c51499	In this ... place, ... there will once more be
c51500	desolate ... without man or beast,
c51501	and in all its cities, ... pastures for shepherds
c51502	to rest [their] flocks.
c51503	In the cities of the hill country, the foothills, [and] the Negev, in the land of Benjamin and the cities surrounding Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them,
c51504	says the LORD.
c51505	Behold, the days are coming,
c51506	declares the LORD,
c51507	when I will fulfill the gracious promise
c51508	that I have spoken to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
c51509	In those days and at that time I will cause to sprout a Righteous Branch of David,
c51510	and He will administer justice and righteousness in the land.
c51511	In those days Judah will be saved,
c51512	and Jerusalem will dwell securely,
c51513	and this
c51514	is the name by which she will be called:
c51515	The LORD Our Righteousness.
c51516	For this is what the LORD says:
c51517	David will never lack a man
c51518	to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,
c51519	nor will the priests who are Levites ... fail to have a man before
c51520	Me to offer burnt offerings,
c51521	to burn grain offerings,
c51522	and to present sacrifices.”
c51523	ever
c51524	And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
c51526	“This is what the LORD says:
c51527	If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night,
c51528	so that day and night cease to occupy their appointed time,
c51529	then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant
c51530	so that [David] will not have a son
c51531	to reign on his throne.
c51532	and with My ministers the Levites who are priests,
c51533	As the hosts of heaven cannot be counted
c51534	[and] the sand of the sea cannot be measured,
c51535	so too will I multiply the descendants of My servant David and the Levites
c51536	who minister before Me.”
c51537	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
c51539	“Have you not noticed
c51540	what these people are saying:
c51542	the two families
c51543	‘The LORD ... He had chosen’?
c51544	has rejected
c51545	So they despise My people
c51546	and no longer regard them as a nation.
c51547	This is what the LORD says:
c51548	If I have not ... My covenant with the day and the night
c51549	established ... and the fixed laws of heaven and earth,
c51550	then I would also reject the seed of Jacob and of My servant David,
c51551	so as not to take from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
c51552	For I will restore them from captivity
c51553	and have compassion on them.”
c51554	This is the word
c51555	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD
c51556	when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, all his army, all the earthly kingdoms under his control, and all the other nations were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding cities:
c51558	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c51559	Go,
c51560	speak to Zedekiah king of Judah
c51561	and tell him
c51562	that this is what the LORD says:
c51563	I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon,
c51564	and he will burn it down.
c51565	As for you, you will not escape his grasp
c51566	but will surely be captured
c51567	and handed over to him.
c51568	You will see the king of Babylon eye ... eye
c51569	to ... and speak to him face to face;
c51570	and you will go to Babylon.
c51571	Yet hear the word of the LORD,
c51572	O Zedekiah king of Judah.
c51573	This is what the LORD says concerning you:
c51574	You will not die by the sword;
c51575	you will die in peace.
c51576	As [spices] were burned for your fathers, the former kings
c51577	who preceded you,
c51578	so [people] will burn [spices] for you
c51580	‘Alas, O master!’
c51581	and lament,
c51582	For I Myself have spoken this word,
c51583	declares the LORD.”
c51584	In Jerusalem, then, Jeremiah the prophet related all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah
c51585	as the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the remaining cities of Judah— against Lachish and Azekah.
c51586	For these were the only remaining fortified cities left in Judah.
c51587	the word
c51588	came to Jeremiah from the LORD
c51589	After King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people
c51590	in Jerusalem
c51591	to proclaim liberty,
c51592	should free
c51593	that each man ... slaves,
c51594	one
c51595	his Hebrew ... [both male] and female,
c51596	and no ... should hold his fellow Jew {in bondage}.
c51597	So all the officials and all the people ... agreed
c51598	who entered into this covenant
c51599	to free
c51600	their menservants
c51601	and maidservants
c51603	and no longer to hold them in bondage.
c51604	They obeyed
c51605	and released them,
c51606	but later they changed their minds
c51607	and took back the menservants and maidservants
c51608	they had freed,
c51609	and they forced them to become slaves again.
c51610	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
c51611	saying,
c51612	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c51613	I made a covenant with your forefathers when
c51614	I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,
c51615	saying:
c51616	Every seventh year, ... of you must free
c51617	each ... brother
c51618	his Hebrew
c51619	who has sold himself to you.
c51620	He may serve you six years,
c51621	but then you must let him go free.
c51622	But your fathers did not listen
c51623	or incline their ear.
c51624	In this day you repented
c51625	and did what pleased Me;
c51626	of you proclaimed liberty
c51627	each ... for his neighbor.
c51628	You made a covenant before Me in the house
c51629	that bears My name.
c51630	But now you have changed your minds
c51631	and profaned My name.
c51632	has taken back
c51633	Each of you ... the menservants and maidservants
c51635	whom you had set at liberty to go wherever they wanted,
c51636	and you have again forced them
c51637	to be your slaves.
c51638	Therefore, this is what the LORD says:
c51639	You have not obeyed Me;
c51640	you have not proclaimed freedom,
c51641	each man for his brother
c51642	and for his neighbor.
c51643	So now I proclaim freedom for you,
c51644	declares the LORD—
c51645	[freedom] to [fall] by sword, by plague, and by famine!
c51646	I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
c51647	I will treat
c51648	And those who have transgressed My covenant
c51649	and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant
c51650	they made before Me,
c51651	like the calf
c51652	they cut in two
c51653	in order to pass between its pieces.
c51654	The officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land
c51655	who passed between the pieces of the calf,
c51656	I will hand over to their enemies who seek their lives.
c51657	Their corpses will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
c51658	I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials over to their enemies who seek their lives, to the army of the king of Babylon
c51659	that had withdrawn from you.
c51660	Behold, I am going to give the command,
c51661	declares the LORD,
c51662	and I will bring them back to this city.
c51663	They will fight against it,
c51664	capture it,
c51665	and burn it down.
c51666	And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.”
c51667	This is the word
c51668	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
c51670	“Go to the house of the Rechabites,
c51671	speak to them,
c51672	and bring them to one of the chambers of the house of the LORD
c51673	to offer them a drink of wine.”
c51674	So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons— the entire house of the Rechabites—
c51675	and I brought them into the temple of the LORD, to a chamber occupied by the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God.
c51676	This [room was] near the chamber of the officials,
c51677	which was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper.
c51678	Then I set pitchers ... before the men of the house of the Rechabites
c51679	full of wine
c51680	and cups
c51681	and said to them,
c51682	“Drink some wine.”
c51683	they replied,
c51684	“We do not drink wine,”
c51685	“for our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us,
c51687	‘Neither you nor your descendants are ever to drink wine.
c51688	Nor are you ever to build a house
c51689	or sow seed ... not for you.
c51690	or plant a vineyard.
c51691	Those things are
c51692	Instead, you must live in tents all your lives,
c51693	so that you may live a long time in the land
c51694	where you sojourn.’
c51695	We have obeyed the voice of our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab in all
c51696	he commanded us.
c51697	So we have not drunk wine all our lives— neither we [nor] our wives [nor] sons [nor] daughters.
c51698	Nor have we built houses
c51699	to live in
c51700	[or] had vineyards, fields, or crops.
c51701	But we have lived in tents
c51702	and have obeyed
c51703	and done exactly as
c51704	our forefather Jonadab commanded us.
c51705	But when
c51706	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched into the land,
c51707	we said:
c51708	‘Come,
c51709	let us go into Jerusalem to escape the armies of the Chaldeans and the Arameans.
c51710	So we have remained in Jerusalem.”
c51711	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
c51713	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c51714	Go
c51715	and tell the men of Judah and residents of Jerusalem:
c51716	‘Will you not accept discipline
c51717	and obey My words?’
c51718	declares the LORD.
c51719	The words of Jonadab son of Rechab have been carried out.
c51720	He commanded his sons
c51721	not to drink wine,
c51722	and they have not drunk [it] to this very day
c51723	because they have obeyed the command of their forefather.
c51724	But I have spoken to you again and again,
c51725	and you have not obeyed Me!
c51726	Time and time again I have sent you all My servants the prophets, ... in
c51727	proclaiming:
c51728	‘Turn now, each of you, from your wicked ways,
c51729	and correct your actions.
c51730	Do not go after other gods
c51731	to serve them.
c51732	Live ... the land
c51733	that I have given to you and your fathers.’
c51734	But you have not inclined your ear
c51735	or listened to Me.
c51736	Yes, the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab carried out the command their forefather
c51737	gave them,
c51738	but these people have not listened to Me.
c51739	Therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c51740	‘Behold, I will bring to Judah and to all the residents of Jerusalem all the disaster
c51741	I have pronounced against them,
c51742	because I have spoken to them
c51743	but they have not obeyed,
c51744	and I have called to them
c51745	but they have not answered.’”
c51746	Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites:
c51747	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c51748	‘Because you have obeyed the command of your forefather Jonadab
c51749	and have kept all his commandments
c51750	and have done all
c51751	that he charged you to do,
c51752	this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c51753	Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a man
c51754	to stand before Me.’”
c51756	In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, ... came
c51757	this word ... to Jeremiah from the LORD:
c51759	“Take a scroll
c51760	and write on it all the words
c51761	I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations, from the day
c51762	I first spoke to you
c51763	during the reign of Josiah until today.
c51764	Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the calamity
c51765	I plan
c51766	to bring upon them,
c51767	each of them will turn from his wicked way.
c51768	Then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin.”
c51769	So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah.
c51770	At the dictation of Jeremiah, Baruch wrote ... all the words the LORD
c51771	had spoken to Jeremiah.
c51772	on a scroll
c51773	Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch,
c51775	“I am restricted;
c51776	I cannot
c51777	enter the temple of the LORD;
c51778	so you are to go
c51779	you are to read ... from the scroll
c51780	you wrote at my dictation.
c51781	to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting, and in the hearing of the people ... the words of the LORD
c51782	in the hearing of all [the people of] Judah
c51783	who are coming from their cities.
c51784	Read them
c51785	Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD,
c51786	and each one will turn from his wicked way;
c51787	for great are the anger and fury
c51788	that the LORD has pronounced against this people.”
c51789	So Baruch son of Neriah did everything
c51790	Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him.
c51791	In the house of the LORD he read the words of the LORD from the scroll.
c51792	Now in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah,
c51793	a fast before the LORD was proclaimed to all the people of Jerusalem and all
c51794	who had come [there] from the cities of Judah.
c51795	From the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, which was in the upper courtyard at the opening of the New Gate of the house of the LORD, Baruch read from the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the hearing of all the people.
c51796	When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
c51797	he went down to the scribe’s chamber in the king’s palace,
c51798	where all the officials were sitting:
c51799	Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.
c51800	And Micaiah reported to them all the words
c51801	he had heard
c51802	Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.
c51803	Then all the officials sent word to Baruch through Jehudi son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi,
c51804	saying,
c51805	the scroll
c51806	that you read in the hearing of the people,
c51807	“Bring
c51808	and come.”
c51809	So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll
c51810	and went to them.
c51811	they said,
c51812	“Please sit down,”
c51813	“and read it in our hearing.”
c51814	So Baruch read it in their hearing.
c51816	When they had heard all these words,
c51817	in fear
c51818	they turned to each other
c51819	and said to Baruch,
c51820	“Surely we must report all these words to the king.”
c51821	they asked Baruch,
c51823	“Tell us now,”
c51824	“how did you write all these words? [Was it] at [Jeremiah’s] dictation?”
c51825	Baruch replied.
c51826	“[It was] at his dictation,” ... “He recited all these words to me
c51827	and I wrote [them] in ink on the scroll.”
c51828	Then the officials said to Baruch,
c51830	“You and Jeremiah must hide
c51831	yourselves and let no one [know]
c51832	where you are.”
c51833	So [the officials] went to the king in the courtyard.
c51834	And having stored the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe,
c51835	they reported everything to the king.
c51836	The king sent Jehudi
c51837	to get the scroll,
c51838	and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe.
c51839	And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and all the officials
c51840	who were standing beside [him].
c51841	Since it was the ninth month, the king was sitting in his winter quarters
c51842	with a fire burning before him.
c51843	And
c51844	as soon as Jehudi had read three or four columns,
c51845	Jehoiakim would cut [them off] with a scribe’s knife
c51846	and throw [them] into
c51847	the firepot,
c51848	until the entire scroll had been consumed by the fire.
c51850	did not become frightened
c51851	all ... the king ... his servants ... or tear their garments.
c51852	Yet in hearing ... these words, ... [and]
c51853	Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah had urged the king
c51854	not to burn the scroll,
c51855	he would not listen to them.
c51856	Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, as well as Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel,
c51857	to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet.
c51858	But the LORD had hidden them.
c51859	with the words ... at Jeremiah’s ... of the LORD came to
c51860	After the king had burned the scroll ... the word
c51861	Baruch had written ... dictation, ... Jeremiah:
c51863	and
c51864	“Take another scroll
c51865	rewrite on it the very words
c51866	that were on the original scroll,
c51867	which Jehoiakim king of Judah has burned.
c51868	You are to proclaim concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah
c51869	that this is what the LORD says:
c51870	You have burned the scroll
c51871	and said,
c51872	‘Why have you written on it
c51873	that
c51874	the king of Babylon would surely come
c51875	and destroy this land
c51876	and deprive it of man and beast?’
c51877	Therefore, this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah:
c51878	He will have no
c51879	one to sit on David’s throne,
c51880	and his body will be thrown out to be exposed to heat by day and frost by night.
c51881	I will punish him and his descendants and servants for their iniquity. ... on them, on
c51882	I will bring ... the residents of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the calamity
c51883	about which I warned them
c51884	but they did not listen.”
c51885	Then Jeremiah took another scroll
c51886	and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah,
c51887	and at Jeremiah’s dictation he wrote on it all the words of the scroll
c51888	that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire.
c51889	And many similar words were added to them.
c51890	Zedekiah son of Josiah ... and he reigned in place of Coniah son of Jehoiakim.
c51891	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon named ... the king of Judah,
c51892	He and his officers and the people of the land refused to obey the words that the LORD
c51893	had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.
c51894	Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet
c51895	with the message,
c51896	“Please pray for us to the LORD our God!”
c51897	Now Jeremiah was free to come
c51898	and go among the people,
c51899	for they had not yet put him into the prison.
c51900	Pharaoh’s army had left Egypt,
c51901	and when the Chaldeans ... heard
c51902	who were besieging Jerusalem
c51903	the report,
c51904	they withdrew from Jerusalem.
c51905	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:
c51907	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c51908	Tell the king of Judah,
c51909	who is sending you ... of Me,
c51910	to inquire
c51911	‘Behold, Pharaoh’s army,
c51912	which has marched out to help you,
c51913	is going back to its own land of Egypt.
c51914	Then the Chaldeans will return
c51915	and fight against this city.
c51916	They will capture
c51917	it and burn it down.’
c51918	This is what the LORD says:
c51919	Do not deceive yourselves
c51920	by saying,
c51921	‘The Chaldeans will go away for good,’
c51922	for they will not!
c51923	Indeed,
c51924	if you were to strike down the entire army of the Chaldeans
c51925	that is fighting against you
c51926	and only wounded men remained
c51927	in their tents,
c51928	they would still get up
c51929	and burn this city down.”
c51931	When the Chaldean army withdrew from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,
c51932	Jeremiah started to leave Jerusalem
c51933	to go to the land of Benjamin
c51934	to claim his portion there among the people.
c51935	But when he reached the Gate of Benjamin,
c51936	the captain of the guard,
c51937	whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah,
c51938	seized [him]
c51939	and said,
c51940	“You are deserting to the Chaldeans!”
c51941	Jeremiah replied.
c51942	“That is a lie,”
c51943	“I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!”
c51944	would not listen to him;
c51945	But Irijah ... instead, he arrested Jeremiah
c51946	and took him to the officials.
c51947	The officials were angry with Jeremiah,
c51948	and they beat him
c51949	and placed him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe,
c51950	for it had been made into a prison.
c51951	So Jeremiah went into a cell in the dungeon
c51952	and remained there a long time.
c51953	Later, King Zedekiah sent for him
c51954	and received him,
c51955	and in his palace he privately asked, ... the king
c51956	replied.
c51957	“Is there a word from the LORD?”
c51958	Jeremiah
c51959	“There is,”
c51961	“You will be handed over to ... of Babylon.”
c51962	Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah,
c51963	“How have I sinned against you or your servants or these people,
c51964	that you have put me in prison?
c51965	Where are your prophets,
c51966	who prophesied to you,
c51967	claiming,
c51968	‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or this land’?
c51969	But now
c51970	please listen,
c51971	O my lord the king.
c51972	May my petition come before you.
c51973	Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe,
c51974	or I will die there.”
c51975	So King Zedekiah gave orders,
c51976	and Jeremiah was placed in the courtyard of the guard
c51977	and given a loaf of bread daily from the baker’s street,
c51978	until all the bread in the city was gone.
c51979	So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
c51980	Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchijah heard the words
c51981	Jeremiah was telling all the people:
c51983	“This is what the LORD says:
c51984	Whoever stays in this city
c51985	will die by sword, famine, and plague,
c51986	but whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans
c51987	will live.
c51988	He will escape with his life as a reward
c51989	and will live.
c51990	This is what the LORD says:
c51991	This city will surely be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon,
c51992	and he will capture it.”
c51993	Then the officials said to the king,
c51994	“This man ought to die,
c51995	for he is discouraging the warriors
c51996	who remain in this city,
c51997	as well as all the people,
c51998	by speaking such words to them;
c51999	this man ... but
c52000	is not seeking the well-being of these people,
c52001	their ruin.”
c52002	replied King Zedekiah.
c52003	“Here he is,” ... “He is in your hands,
c52004	since the king can do nothing
c52005	to stop you.”
c52006	So they took Jeremiah
c52007	and dropped him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s son,
c52008	which was in the courtyard of the guard.
c52009	They lowered Jeremiah with ropes
c52010	into the cistern, which had no water
c52011	but only mud,
c52012	and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.
c52013	Now Ebed-melech the Cushite, a court official ... heard
c52014	in the royal palace,
c52015	that Jeremiah had been put into the cistern.
c52016	While the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin,
c52017	Ebed-melech went out from the king’s palace
c52018	and said to the king,
c52020	“My lord the king,
c52021	these men have acted wickedly in all that
c52022	they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. ... him
c52023	They have dropped ... into the cistern,
c52024	where he will starve to death,
c52025	for there is no more bread in the city.”
c52026	So the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite,
c52028	“Take thirty men from here with you
c52029	and pull Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern
c52030	before he dies.”
c52031	Then Ebed-melech took the men with him
c52032	and went to the king’s palace, to a place below the storehouse.
c52033	From there he took old rags and worn-out clothes
c52034	and lowered them with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
c52035	Ebed-melech the Cushite cried out to Jeremiah,
c52036	“Put these worn-out rags and clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.”
c52037	Jeremiah did so,
c52038	and they pulled him up with the ropes
c52039	and lifted him out of the cistern.
c52040	And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
c52041	Then King Zedekiah sent for
c52042	Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance
c52043	that is in the house of the LORD.
c52044	said the king to Jeremiah.
c52045	“I am going to ask you something,”
c52046	“Do not hide anything from me.”
c52047	Jeremiah replied,
c52048	“If I tell you,”
c52049	“will you not surely put me to death?
c52050	And even if I did give you advice,
c52051	you would not listen to me.”
c52052	But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah secretly,
c52054	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c52055	who has given us this life,
c52056	I will not kill you
c52057	or hand you over to these men
c52058	who are seeking your life.”
c52059	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah,
c52060	“This is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c52061	‘If you indeed surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon,
c52062	then you will live,
c52063	this city will not be burned down,
c52064	and you and your household will survive.
c52065	But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon,
c52066	then this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans.
c52067	They will burn it down,
c52068	and you yourself will not escape their grasp.’”
c52069	But King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah,
c52070	“I am afraid of the Jews
c52071	who have deserted to the Chaldeans,
c52072	for [the Chaldeans] may hand me over to them
c52073	to abuse me.”
c52074	Jeremiah replied.
c52075	“They will not hand you over,”
c52076	“Obey the voice of the LORD
c52077	in what I am telling you,
c52078	so it may go well with you
c52079	and you may live.
c52080	But if you refuse
c52081	to surrender,
c52082	this [is] the word
c52083	that the LORD has shown me:
c52084	All the women
c52085	who remain in the palace of the king of Judah
c52086	will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon,
c52087	and those [women] will say:
c52088	‘They misled you
c52089	and overcame you— those trusted friends of yours.
c52090	Your feet sank into the mire,
c52091	and they deserted you.’”
c52092	All your wives and children will be brought out to the Chaldeans.
c52093	And you yourself will not escape their grasp,
c52094	for you will be seized by the king of Babylon,
c52095	and this city will be burned down.’
c52096	Then Zedekiah warned Jeremiah,
c52097	“Do not let anyone know about this conversation,
c52098	or you will die.
c52099	If the officials hear
c52100	that I have spoken with
c52101	you and come ... of you,
c52102	and demand ... to
c52103	‘Tell
c52104	us what you said ... the king ... to you;
c52105	do not hide it from us,
c52106	[or] we will kill you,’
c52107	and what [he] said
c52108	then tell them,
c52109	‘I was presenting to the king my petition
c52110	that he not return me to the house of Jonathan
c52111	to die there.’”
c52112	When all the officials came to Jeremiah
c52113	and questioned him,
c52114	he reported to them the exact words
c52115	the king had commanded.
c52116	So they said no more to him,
c52117	for no one had overheard the conversation.
c52118	And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day
c52119	Jerusalem was captured.
c52122	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army
c52123	and laid siege to [the city].
c52124	And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, the city was broken through.
c52125	Then all the officials of the king of Babylon entered
c52126	and sat in the Middle Gate:
c52127	Nergal-sharezer, Samgar, Nebusarsechim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.
c52129	When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them,
c52130	they fled.
c52131	They left the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls,
c52132	and they went out along the route to the Arabah.
c52133	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them
c52134	and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho.
c52135	They seized him
c52136	and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath,
c52137	where he pronounced judgment on him.
c52138	There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes,
c52139	and he also killed all the nobles of Judah.
c52140	Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes
c52141	and bound him with bronze chains
c52142	to take him to Babylon.
c52143	The Chaldeans set fire to the palace of the king and to the houses of the people,
c52144	and they tore down the walls of Jerusalem.
c52145	Then ... the remnant
c52146	who had remained in the city,
c52147	along with the deserters
c52148	who had defected to
c52149	him and the rest of the people.
c52151	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried away to Babylon
c52152	some of the poor people,
c52153	who had no property,
c52154	But Nebuzaradan left behind in the land of Judah
c52155	and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields.
c52156	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard,
c52157	saying,
c52158	“Take him,
c52159	look after him,
c52160	and do not let any harm come to him;
c52162	him whatever he says.”
c52163	do for
c52164	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag, and all the captains of the king of Babylon
c52165	brought
c52166	had Jeremiah ... from the courtyard of the guard,
c52167	and they turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,
c52168	to take him home.
c52169	So he remained among his own people.
c52170	the word of the LORD had come to [him]:
c52171	And while [Jeremiah] had been confined in the courtyard of the guard,
c52173	“Go
c52174	and tell Ebed-melech the Cushite that
c52175	says:
c52176	this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel,
c52177	I am about to fulfill My words against this city for harm
c52178	and not for good,
c52179	and on that day they will be fulfilled before your eyes.
c52180	But I will deliver you on that day,
c52181	declares the LORD,
c52182	and you will not be handed over to the men
c52183	you fear.
c52184	For I will surely rescue you
c52185	so that you do not fall by the sword.
c52186	you will escape with your life like a spoil of war,
c52187	Because you have trusted in Me,
c52188	declares the LORD.”
c52189	This is the word
c52190	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD
c52191	after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had released him at Ramah,
c52192	having found
c52193	him bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah
c52194	who were being exiled to Babylon.
c52195	The captain of the guard found Jeremiah
c52196	and said to him,
c52197	“The LORD your God decreed this disaster on this place,
c52198	has fulfilled it;
c52199	and now the LORD ... He has done
c52200	just as He said.
c52201	Because you [people] have sinned against the LORD
c52202	and have not obeyed His voice,
c52203	this thing has happened to you.
c52204	But now,
c52205	behold, I am freeing you today from the chains
c52206	that were on your wrists.
c52207	If it pleases
c52208	you to come with me to Babylon,
c52209	then come,
c52210	and I will take care of you.
c52211	But if it seems wrong
c52212	to you to come with me to Babylon,
c52213	go no farther.
c52214	Look,
c52215	the whole land is before you.
c52216	Wherever it seems good and right
c52217	for you to go, ... there.”
c52218	go
c52220	But before Jeremiah turned to go,
c52221	Nebuzaradan told him, “Return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,
c52222	whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah,
c52223	and stay with him among the people,
c52224	or ... anywhere else
c52225	that seems right.”
c52226	go
c52228	Then the captain of the guard gave him a ration and a gift
c52229	and released him.
c52230	So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah
c52231	and stayed with him among the people
c52232	who were left in the land.
c52233	When all the commanders ... of the armies ... heard
c52234	in the field ... [and]
c52235	and men
c52236	that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land
c52237	and that he had put him in charge of the men, women, and children [who were] the poorest of the land
c52238	had not been exiled to Babylon,
c52239	they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—
c52240	Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite: they and their men.
c52241	Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore an oath to them and their men,
c52242	assuring them,
c52243	“Do not be afraid
c52244	to serve the Chaldeans.
c52245	Live in the land
c52246	and serve the king of Babylon,
c52247	and it will go well for you.
c52248	As for me,
c52249	I will stay in Mizpah
c52250	to represent you before the Chaldeans
c52251	who come to us.
c52252	As for you, gather in wine, summer fruit, and oil,
c52253	place them in your storage jars,
c52254	and live in the cities
c52255	you have taken over.”
c52256	When all the Jews
c52257	in Moab, Ammon, Edom,
c52258	and all the other lands
c52259	heard
c52260	that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah
c52261	and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over them,
c52262	they all returned from all the places
c52263	to which they had been banished
c52264	and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah.
c52265	And they gathered an abundance of wine and summer fruit.
c52266	Meanwhile, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies
c52267	in the field
c52268	came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
c52269	and said to him,
c52270	“Are you aware
c52271	that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah
c52272	to take your life?”
c52273	But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.
c52274	Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah at Mizpah.
c52275	he said.
c52276	“Let me go
c52277	and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah,”
c52278	“No one will know it.
c52279	Why should he take your life
c52280	and scatter all the Jews
c52281	who have gathered to you,
c52282	so that the remnant of Judah would perish?”
c52283	But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah,
c52284	“Do not do such a thing!
c52285	What you are saying about Ishmael is a lie.”
c52286	In the seventh month,
c52287	Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, [who was a member] of the royal family ... came
c52288	and one of the king’s chief officers, ... with ten men
c52289	to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah,
c52290	and they ate a meal together there.
c52291	Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men ... him got up
c52292	who were with
c52293	and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword,
c52294	killing the one
c52295	whom the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the land.
c52296	all the Jews
c52297	who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah,
c52298	as well as the Chaldean
c52299	who were there.
c52300	Ishmael also killed ... soldiers
c52301	On the second day
c52302	after the murder of Gedaliah,
c52303	when no one yet knew about it,
c52304	men ... came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria,
c52305	eighty ... who had shaved off their beards, torn their garments, and cut themselves
c52306	carrying grain offerings and incense
c52307	to bring to the temple of the LORD.
c52308	And Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out
c52309	to meet them,
c52310	from Mizpah
c52311	as he went.
c52312	weeping
c52314	When [Ishmael] encountered [the men],
c52315	he said, ... to
c52316	“Come ... Gedaliah son of Ahikam.”
c52318	And when they came into the city,
c52319	Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men ... slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.
c52320	with him
c52321	But ten of the men among them
c52322	said to Ishmael,
c52323	“Do not kill us,
c52324	for we have hidden treasure in the field— wheat, barley, oil, and honey!”
c52325	So he refrained
c52326	from killing them with the others.
c52327	Now the cistern
c52328	into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men
c52329	he had struck down along with Gedaliah was a large one that
c52331	King Asa had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel.
c52332	Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
c52333	Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people
c52334	of Mizpah— ... over whom
c52335	the daughters of the king along with all the others
c52336	who remained in Mizpah—
c52337	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam.
c52338	Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive
c52339	and set off
c52340	to cross over to the Ammonites.
c52341	When Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies ... heard
c52342	with ... that
c52343	him ... of all the crimes
c52344	Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed,
c52345	they took all their men
c52346	and went
c52347	to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah.
c52348	And they found him near the great pool
c52349	in Gibeon.
c52351	When all the people ... saw
c52352	with Ishmael
c52353	Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the army
c52354	with him,
c52355	they rejoiced,
c52356	and all the people ... turned
c52357	whom Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah
c52359	and went over to Johanan son of Kareah.
c52360	But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight [of his] men escaped from Johanan
c52361	and went to the Ammonites.
c52362	Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies ... took
c52363	with him ... whom
c52364	the whole remnant of the people
c52365	from Mizpah ... he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah
c52366	after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam:
c52367	the soldiers, women, children, and court officials
c52368	he had brought back from Gibeon.
c52369	And they went
c52370	and stayed in Geruth
c52371	Chimham, near Bethlehem,
c52372	in order to proceed
c52373	into Egypt
c52374	to escape the Chaldeans.
c52375	For they were afraid of [the Chaldeans]
c52376	because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam,
c52377	whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
c52378	Then all the commanders of the forces, along with Johanan son of Kareah, Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached
c52379	Jeremiah the prophet and said, ... to
c52380	“May our petition come before you;
c52381	pray ... the LORD your God on behalf of this entire remnant.
c52382	For few of us remain of the many,
c52383	as you can see with your own eyes.
c52384	[Pray] that the LORD your God may tell us the way
c52385	we should walk
c52386	and the thing
c52387	we should do.”
c52388	replied Jeremiah the prophet.
c52389	“I have heard you,”
c52390	“I will surely pray to the LORD your God as you request,
c52392	everything
c52393	that the LORD answers;
c52394	and I will tell you
c52395	I will not withhold a word from you.”
c52396	Then they said to Jeremiah,
c52397	“May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us
c52398	if we do not
c52399	every word
c52400	that the LORD your God sends you to tell us.
c52401	act upon
c52402	Whether it is pleasant
c52403	or unpleasant,
c52404	the voice of the LORD our God
c52405	to whom we are sending you,
c52406	we will obey
c52407	so that it may go well with us,
c52408	for we will obey the voice of the LORD our God!”
c52409	After ten days, ... came
c52410	the word of the LORD ... to Jeremiah,
c52411	and he summoned Johanan son of Kareah, all the commanders of the forces
c52412	who were with him,
c52413	and all the people from the least to the greatest.
c52414	[Jeremiah] told them,
c52415	“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel,
c52416	to whom you sent me
c52417	to present your petition:
c52418	If you will indeed stay in this land,
c52419	then I will build you up
c52420	and not tear you down;
c52421	I will plant you
c52422	and not uproot you,
c52423	for I shall relent of the disaster
c52424	I have brought upon you.
c52425	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon,
c52426	whom you now fear; ... of him,
c52427	do not be afraid
c52428	declares the LORD,
c52429	for I am with
c52430	you to save you
c52431	and deliver you from him.
c52432	And I will show you compassion,
c52433	and he will have compassion on you
c52434	and restore you to your own land.
c52435	But if you say,
c52436	‘We will not stay in this land,’
c52437	and so disobey the voice of the LORD your God,
c52438	and if you say,
c52439	‘No,
c52440	but we will go to the land of Egypt
c52441	where we will not see war,
c52442	or hear the sound of the trumpet,
c52443	or hunger for food,’
c52444	and live there,
c52445	then
c52446	hear the word of the LORD,
c52447	O remnant of Judah!
c52448	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c52449	If you are determined
c52450	to go to Egypt
c52452	and reside there,
c52454	then the sword
c52455	you fear
c52456	will overtake you there,
c52457	and the famine
c52458	you dread
c52459	will follow on your heels into Egypt,
c52460	and you will die there.
c52461	So all ... will
c52462	who resolve
c52463	to go to Egypt
c52464	to reside there
c52465	die by the sword, famine, and plague.
c52466	Not one of them will survive or escape the disaster
c52467	I will bring upon them.
c52468	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c52469	‘Just as My anger and wrath were poured out on the residents of Jerusalem,
c52470	so will My wrath be poured out on you
c52471	if you go to Egypt.
c52472	You will become an object of cursing and horror, of vilification and disgrace,
c52473	and you will never see this place again.’
c52474	The LORD has told you,
c52475	O remnant of Judah,
c52476	‘Do not go to Egypt.’
c52477	Know for sure
c52478	that I have warned you today!
c52479	For you have deceived
c52480	yourselves by sending me to the LORD your God,
c52481	saying,
c52482	‘Pray to the LORD our God on our behalf,
c52483	and as for all
c52484	that the LORD our God says,
c52485	tell it to us,
c52486	and we will do it.’
c52487	For I have told you today,
c52488	but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God
c52489	in all
c52490	He has sent me to tell you.
c52491	Now therefore, know for sure
c52492	that by the sword, famine, and plague you will die in the place
c52493	where you desire
c52494	to go
c52495	to reside.”
c52497	When Jeremiah had finished
c52498	telling all the people all the words of the LORD their God—
c52499	everything that the LORD had sent him to [say]—
c52500	then Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said
c52501	to Jeremiah, ... you to say,
c52502	“You are lying!
c52503	The LORD our God has not sent
c52505	‘You must not go to Egypt
c52506	to reside there.’
c52507	Rather, Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you
c52508	against us to hand us over to the Chaldeans,
c52509	so that they may put us to death
c52510	or exile us to Babylon!”
c52511	So Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces disobeyed the command of the LORD
c52512	to stay in the land of Judah.
c52513	Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies took the whole remnant of Judah,
c52514	those who had returned ... from all the nations
c52515	to which they had been scattered,
c52516	to the land of Judah
c52517	the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, and everyone
c52518	whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had allowed to remain with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,
c52519	as well as Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.
c52520	So they entered the land of Egypt
c52521	because they did not obey the voice of the LORD,
c52522	and they went as far as Tahpanhes.
c52523	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah at Tahpanhes:
c52525	pick up some large stones
c52526	and bury them in the clay of the brick pavement
c52527	at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace at Tahpanhes.
c52528	“In the sight [of the] Jews,
c52529	Then say to them,
c52530	‘This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c52531	I will send for
c52532	My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
c52533	and I will set his throne over these stones
c52534	that I have embedded,
c52535	and he will spread his royal pavilion over them.
c52536	He will come
c52537	and strike down the land of Egypt,
c52538	to those destined for death,
c52539	bringing death
c52541	to those destined for captivity,
c52542	captivity
c52544	to those destined for the sword.
c52545	and the sword
c52546	I will kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt,
c52547	and he will burn [those temples]
c52548	and take [their gods] as captives.
c52549	So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt
c52550	as a shepherd wraps himself in his garment,
c52551	and he will depart from there unscathed.
c52552	He will demolish the sacred pillars of the temple of the sun
c52553	in Egypt,
c52554	and he will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.”
c52555	This is the word
c52556	that came to Jeremiah
c52557	concerning all the Jews
c52558	living in the land of Egypt—
c52559	in Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis— and in the land of Pathros:
c52561	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c52562	You have seen all the disaster
c52563	I brought against Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah;
c52564	and behold, they lie today in ruins and
c52565	desolation
c52566	because of the evil
c52567	they have done.
c52568	They provoked Me to anger
c52569	by continuing
c52570	to burn incense
c52571	[and] to serve other gods
c52572	that neither ... ever knew.
c52573	they [nor] you nor your fathers
c52574	Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets again and again,
c52575	saying:
c52576	‘Do not do this detestable thing
c52577	that I hate.’
c52578	But they did not listen
c52579	or incline their ears; they did not
c52580	turn from their wickedness
c52581	or stop burning incense to other gods.
c52582	Therefore My wrath and anger poured out
c52583	and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem,
c52584	so they have become the desolate
c52585	ruin they are today.
c52586	So now,
c52587	this is what the LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c52588	Why are you doing such great harm to yourselves?
c52589	You are cutting off from Judah man and woman, child and infant,
c52590	leaving yourselves without a remnant,
c52591	provoking Me to anger by the work of your hands,
c52592	burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt
c52593	where you have gone
c52594	to reside.
c52595	As a result, you will be cut off
c52596	and become an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations of the earth.
c52597	Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and of the kings of Judah and their wives, as well as the wickedness that you and your wives
c52598	committed in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem?
c52599	To this day they have not humbled themselves
c52600	[or] shown reverence,
c52601	nor have they followed My instruction or the statutes
c52602	that I set before you and your fathers.
c52603	Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c52604	I will set My face to bring disaster
c52605	and to cut off all Judah.
c52606	And I will take away the remnant of Judah
c52607	who have resolved
c52608	to go to the land of Egypt
c52609	to reside there;
c52610	they will meet their end. [They] will all
c52611	fall by the sword
c52612	[or] by famine. From the least to the greatest,
c52613	they will die by sword or famine.
c52614	Then they will become an object of cursing [and] horror, of vilification and reproach.
c52615	I will punish
c52616	those who live in the land of Egypt,
c52617	just as I punished Jerusalem, by sword, famine, and plague,
c52618	so that none of the remnant of Judah ... will escape or survive
c52619	who have gone
c52620	to reside in Egypt
c52621	to return to the land of Judah,
c52622	where they long
c52623	to return
c52624	and dwell;
c52625	for none will return
c52626	except a few fugitives.”
c52627	Then all the men ... answered Jeremiah,
c52628	who knew
c52629	that their wives were burning incense to other gods,
c52630	all the women
c52631	standing by—
c52632	a great assembly— along with all the people
c52633	who were living in the land of Egypt at Pathros,
c52635	“As for the word
c52636	you spoke to us in the name of the LORD,
c52637	we will not listen to you!
c52638	Instead, we will do everything
c52639	we said: ... just as
c52640	We will burn incense to the queen of heaven
c52641	and offer drink offerings
c52642	to her, ... we, our fathers, our kings, and our officials did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem.
c52643	At that time we had plenty of food
c52644	and good things,
c52645	and we saw no disaster.
c52646	But from the time we stopped
c52647	burning incense to the queen of heaven
c52648	and pouring out drink offerings to her,
c52649	we have lacked everything
c52650	and have been perishing by sword and famine.”
c52651	“Moreover,” [said the women,] “when we burned incense to the queen of heaven
c52652	and poured out drink offerings to her,
c52653	was it without our husbands’ {knowledge} that we made sacrificial cakes
c52654	in her image
c52655	and poured out drink offerings to her?”
c52656	Then Jeremiah said to all the people ... both men and women,
c52657	who were answering him,
c52659	you burned ... not
c52660	“As for the incense ... in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem— you, your fathers, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land—
c52661	did the LORD ... remember
c52662	and bring this to mind?
c52663	So the LORD could no longer
c52664	endure
c52665	the evil deeds and detestable acts
c52666	you committed,
c52667	and your land became a desolation, a horror, and an object of cursing, without inhabitant, as it is today.
c52668	Because you burned incense
c52669	and sinned against the LORD,
c52670	and did not obey the voice of the LORD
c52671	[or] walk ... His instruction, His statutes, and His testimonies,
c52672	in ... this disaster has befallen you, as you see today.”
c52673	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women,
c52674	“Hear the word of the LORD,
c52675	all those of Judah
c52676	who are in the land of Egypt.
c52677	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c52678	your words,
c52679	‘As for you and your wives,
c52680	you have spoken with your mouths
c52681	and fulfilled with your hands
c52683	“We will surely perform our vows
c52684	that we have made
c52685	to burn incense to the queen of heaven
c52686	and to pour out drink offerings to her.”
c52687	Go ahead, then, do what you have promised!
c52688	Keep your vows!
c52689	Nevertheless, hear the word of the LORD,
c52690	all you Jews
c52691	living in Egypt:
c52692	Behold, I have sworn by My great name,
c52693	says the LORD,
c52694	that My name will never again be
c52695	invoked by anyone of Judah
c52696	saying,
c52697	“As surely as the Lord GOD lives.”
c52698	in all the land of Egypt,
c52699	I am watching over them for harm
c52700	and not for good,
c52701	and every man of Judah ... will meet his end
c52702	who is in the land of Egypt
c52703	by sword or famine,
c52704	until they are finished off.
c52705	Those who escape the sword will return from Egypt to Judah, few in number,
c52706	and the whole remnant of Judah ... will know
c52707	who went ... in the land of Egypt
c52708	to dwell
c52709	whose word will stand, Mine or theirs!
c52710	This will be a sign to you,
c52711	declares the LORD,
c52712	that I will punish you in this place,
c52713	so you may know
c52714	that My threats of harm against you will surely stand.
c52715	This is what the LORD says:
c52716	Behold, I am going to hand Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt over to his enemies, to those who seek his life,
c52717	just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who was seeking his life.’”
c52718	This is the word
c52719	that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah
c52720	when he wrote these words on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:
c52722	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you,
c52723	Baruch:
c52724	You have said,
c52725	‘Woe is me,
c52726	because the LORD has added sorrow to my pain!
c52727	I am worn out with groaning
c52728	and have found no rest.’”
c52729	Thus [Jeremiah] was to say to [Baruch}:
c52730	“This is what the LORD says:
c52732	what I have built
c52733	I will demolish
c52735	what I have planted,
c52736	and uproot
c52737	throughout the land!
c52738	But as for you, do you seek great things for yourself?
c52739	Stop seeking!
c52740	For I will bring disaster on every living creature,
c52741	declares the LORD,
c52742	but wherever ... I will grant your life as plunder.”
c52743	you go
c52744	[This is] the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
c52745	To Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, ... on
c52746	which ... at Carchemish ... the Euphrates River
c52747	was defeated ... by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah:
c52748	“Deploy your shields, small and large,
c52749	and advance for battle!
c52750	Harness the horses;
c52751	mount
c52752	the steeds;
c52753	take your positions with helmets on!
c52754	Polish your spears;
c52755	put on armor!
c52756	Why am I seeing this?
c52757	They are terrified,
c52758	they are retreating,
c52759	their warriors are defeated,
c52760	they flee in haste,
c52761	they never look back,
c52762	terror is on every side!
c52763	declares the LORD.
c52764	The swift cannot flee,
c52765	and the warrior cannot escape!
c52766	In the north by the River Euphrates they stumble
c52767	and fall.
c52768	Who is this, rising like the Nile,
c52769	like rivers whose waters churn?
c52770	Egypt rises like the Nile,
c52771	and its waters churn like rivers,
c52772	boasting,
c52773	“I will rise
c52774	and cover the earth;
c52775	I will destroy the cities
c52776	and their people.”
c52777	Advance,
c52778	O horses!
c52779	Race furiously,
c52780	O chariots!
c52781	Let the warriors come forth—
c52782	Cush and Put carrying their shields, men of Lydia drawing the bow.
c52783	That day belongs to the Lord, the GOD of Hosts,
c52784	a day of vengeance
c52785	to avenge Himself against His foes.
c52786	The sword will devour
c52787	until it is satisfied,
c52788	until it is quenched with their blood.
c52789	For it will be a sacrifice to the Lord, the GOD of Hosts, in the land of the north by the River Euphrates.
c52790	Go up to Gilead
c52791	[for] balm,
c52792	O Virgin Daughter of Egypt!
c52793	In vain you multiply remedies;
c52794	there is no healing for you.
c52795	The nations have heard of your shame,
c52796	and your outcry fills the earth,
c52797	because warrior stumbles over warrior
c52798	and both of them have fallen together.”
c52799	This is the word
c52800	that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet
c52801	about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
c52802	to strike the land of Egypt:
c52803	“Announce it in Egypt,
c52804	and proclaim it in Migdol;
c52805	proclaim it in Memphis and Tahpanhes:
c52807	‘Take your positions
c52808	and prepare yourself,
c52809	for the sword devours those around you.’
c52810	Why have your warriors been laid low?
c52811	They cannot stand,
c52812	for the LORD has thrust them down.
c52813	They continue to stumble.
c52814	Indeed, [they] have fallen over one another.
c52815	They say,
c52816	‘Get up!
c52817	Let us return to our people and to the land of our birth, away from the sword of the oppressor.’
c52818	There they will proclaim,
c52819	‘Pharaoh king of Egypt was all noise;
c52820	he has let the appointed time pass him by.’
c52821	As surely as I live,
c52822	declares the King,
c52823	whose name is the LORD of Hosts,
c52824	will come one like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea.
c52825	Pack your bags for exile,
c52826	O daughter dwelling in Egypt!
c52827	For Memphis will be laid waste,
c52828	destroyed and uninhabited.
c52829	Egypt is a beautiful heifer,
c52830	but a gadfly from the north is coming against her.
c52832	Even the mercenaries among her are like fattened calves.
c52833	They too will turn back; ... for
c52834	together they will flee;
c52835	they will not stand their ground,
c52836	the day of their calamity is coming upon them— the time of their punishment.
c52837	Egypt will hiss like a slithering snake,
c52838	for the enemy will advance in force;
c52839	with axes they will come against her like woodsmen cutting down trees.
c52840	They will chop down her forest,
c52841	declares the LORD,
c52842	dense though it may be,
c52843	for they are more numerous than locusts;
c52844	they cannot be counted.
c52845	The Daughter of Egypt will be put to shame,
c52846	handed over to the people of the north.”
c52847	The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c52848	“Behold, I am about to punish Amon god of Thebes, along with Pharaoh, Egypt and her gods and kings, ... in Pharaoh.
c52849	and those who trust
c52850	I will hand them over to those who seek their lives— to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers.
c52851	But after this, [Egypt] will be inhabited again as in ancient times,
c52852	declares the LORD.
c52853	But you, ... do not be afraid,
c52854	O Jacob My servant,
c52855	and do not be dismayed,
c52856	O Israel,
c52857	for surely I will save you from a distant place,
c52858	and your descendants from the land of their captivity!
c52859	Jacob will return
c52860	and be undisturbed
c52861	and secure,
c52862	with no one to make him afraid.
c52863	And you, ... do not be afraid,
c52864	My servant Jacob,
c52865	declares the LORD,
c52866	for I will be with you.
c52867	I will bring destruction on all the nations
c52868	to which I have banished you,
c52869	but I will not make a full end [of you].
c52870	I will discipline you, but with justice;
c52871	I will by no means leave you unpunished.”
c52872	This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet about the Philistines
c52873	before Pharaoh conquered Gaza.
c52874	This is what the LORD says:
c52875	“See how the waters are rising from the north
c52876	and becoming an overflowing torrent.
c52877	They will overflow the land and its fullness, the cities and their inhabitants.
c52878	The people will cry out,
c52879	and all who dwell in the land will wail
c52880	at the sound of the galloping hooves of stallions, the rumbling of chariots, and the clatter of their wheels.
c52881	The fathers will not turn back for their sons; their hands will hang limp.
c52882	For the day
c52883	has come
c52884	to destroy all the Philistines,
c52885	to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every remaining ally.
c52886	Indeed, the LORD is about to destroy the Philistines, the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.
c52887	The people of Gaza will shave their heads in mourning;
c52888	Ashkelon will be silenced.
c52889	O remnant of their valley,
c52890	how long will you gash yourself?
c52891	‘Alas,
c52892	O sword of the LORD,
c52893	how long until you rest?
c52894	Return to your sheath;
c52895	cease
c52896	and be still!’
c52897	How can it rest
c52898	when the LORD has commanded it? ... against Ashkelon and the shore of its coastland.”
c52899	He has appointed it
c52900	Concerning Moab,
c52901	this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c52902	“Woe to Nebo,
c52903	for it will be devastated.
c52904	and disgraced;
c52905	Kiriathaim will be captured
c52906	the fortress ... and dismantled.
c52907	will be shattered
c52908	There is no longer praise for Moab; in Heshbon
c52909	they devise evil against her:
c52910	‘Come,
c52911	let us cut her off from nationhood.’
c52912	You too, O [people of] Madmen,
c52913	will be silenced;
c52914	the sword will pursue you.
c52915	A voice cries out from Horonaim,
c52916	‘Devastation and great destruction!’
c52917	Moab will be shattered;
c52918	her little ones will cry out.
c52919	For on the Ascent to Luhith they weep bitterly as they go,
c52920	and on the descent to Horonaim cries of distress resound over the destruction:
c52921	‘Flee!
c52922	Run for your lives!
c52923	Become like a juniper in the desert.’
c52925	Because you trust in your works and treasures,
c52926	you too will be captured,
c52927	and Chemosh will go into exile
c52928	with his priests and officials.
c52929	The destroyer will move against every city,
c52930	and not one town will escape.
c52931	The valley also will be ruined,
c52932	and the high plain will be destroyed,
c52933	as the LORD has said.
c52934	Put salt on Moab,
c52935	for she will be laid waste;
c52936	her cities will become desolate,
c52937	with no one to dwell in them.
c52938	Cursed [be the one]
c52939	who is negligent in doing the work of the LORD,
c52940	and cursed is
c52941	he who withholds his sword from bloodshed.
c52942	Moab has been at ease from youth,
c52943	settled like wine on its dregs;
c52944	he has not been poured from vessel to vessel
c52945	or gone into exile.
c52946	So his taste has remained the same,
c52947	and his aroma is unchanged.
c52948	Therefore behold, the days are coming,
c52949	declares the LORD,
c52950	when I will send to him wanderers,
c52951	who will pour him out.
c52952	They will empty his vessels
c52953	and shatter his jars.
c52954	Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,
c52955	just as the house of Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.
c52956	How can you say,
c52957	‘We are warriors,
c52958	mighty men ready for battle’?
c52959	Moab has been destroyed
c52960	and its towns invaded;
c52961	the best of its young men have gone down in the slaughter,
c52962	declares the King
c52963	whose name [is] the LORD of Hosts.
c52964	Moab’s calamity is at hand,
c52966	and his affliction is rushing swiftly.
c52967	Mourn for him,
c52968	all you who surround him,
c52969	everyone who knows his name;
c52970	tell
c52971	how the mighty scepter is shattered— the glorious staff!
c52972	Come down from your glory;
c52973	sit on parched ground,
c52974	O daughter dwelling in Dibon,
c52975	for the destroyer of Moab has come against you;
c52976	he has destroyed your fortresses.
c52977	Stand by the road
c52978	and watch,
c52979	O resident of Aroer!
c52980	Ask the man fleeing or the woman escaping,
c52982	‘What has happened?’
c52983	Moab is put to shame,
c52984	for it has been shattered.
c52985	Wail
c52986	and cry out!
c52987	Declare by the Arnon
c52988	that Moab is destroyed.
c52989	Judgment has come upon the high plain— upon Holon, Jahzah, and Mephaath,
c52990	upon Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim,
c52991	upon Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, Beth-meon,
c52992	upon Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns of Moab, those far and near.
c52993	The horn of Moab has been cut off;
c52994	and his arm is broken,
c52995	declares the LORD.
c52996	Make him drunk,
c52997	because he has magnified himself against the LORD;
c52998	so Moab will wallow in his own vomit,
c52999	and he will also become a laughingstock.
c53000	Was not Israel your object of ridicule?
c53001	Was he ever found [among thieves]?
c53002	For whenever you speak of him you shake your head.”
c53003	Abandon the towns
c53004	and dwell among the rocks,
c53005	O residents of Moab!
c53006	Be like a dove
c53007	that nests at the mouth of a cave.
c53008	We have heard
c53009	of Moab’s pride, his exceeding pride
c53010	[and] conceit, his proud arrogance and haughtiness of heart.
c53011	I know
c53012	declares the LORD,
c53013	his fury,
c53014	but it is futile. His boasting
c53015	is as empty as his deeds.
c53016	Therefore I will wail for Moab;
c53017	I will cry out for all of Moab;
c53018	I will moan for the men of Kir-heres.
c53019	I will weep for you, ... more than I weep for Jazer.
c53020	O vine of Sibmah,
c53021	Your tendrils have extended to the sea;
c53022	they reach [even] to Jazer.
c53023	The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruit and grape harvest.
c53024	Joy and gladness are removed from the orchard and from the fields of Moab.
c53025	I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses;
c53026	no one will tread with shouts of joy;
c53027	their shouts are not for joy.
c53028	There is a cry from Heshbon to Elealeh; they raise their voices to Jahaz,
c53029	from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah;
c53030	for even the waters of Nimrim have dried up.
c53031	In Moab, ... I will bring an end
c53032	declares the LORD,
c53033	to those who make offerings on the high places
c53034	and burn incense to their gods.
c53035	Therefore My heart laments for Moab like a flute;
c53036	[it] laments like a flute for the men of Kir-heres,
c53037	because the wealth they acquired
c53038	has perished.
c53039	For every head is shaved
c53040	and every beard is clipped;
c53041	on every hand is a gash
c53042	and around every waist [is] sackcloth.
c53043	On all the rooftops of Moab and in the public squares, everyone is mourning;
c53044	for I have shattered Moab ... jar,
c53045	like an unwanted
c53046	declares the LORD.
c53047	How shattered [it is]!
c53048	How they wail!
c53049	How Moab has turned his back
c53050	in shame!
c53051	Moab will become an object of ridicule and horror to all those around him.”
c53052	For this is what the LORD says:
c53053	“Behold, an eagle swoops down
c53054	and spreads his wings against Moab.
c53055	Kirioth has been taken,
c53056	and the strongholds seized.
c53057	In that day the heart of Moab’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
c53058	Moab will be destroyed as a nation
c53059	because he vaunted himself against the LORD.
c53060	Terror, pit, and snare await you,
c53061	O resident of Moab,
c53062	declares the LORD.
c53063	He who flees the panic
c53064	will fall into the pit,
c53066	and he who climbs from the pit
c53067	will be caught in the snare,
c53068	for I will bring against Moab the year of their punishment,
c53069	declares the LORD.
c53070	will stand ... in Heshbon’s shadow,
c53071	Those who flee ... helpless
c53072	because fire has gone forth from Heshbon
c53073	and a flame from within Sihon.
c53074	It will devour the foreheads of Moab and the skulls of the noisemakers.
c53075	Woe to you,
c53076	O Moab!
c53077	The people of Chemosh have perished;
c53078	for your sons have been taken into exile
c53079	and your daughters have gone into captivity.
c53080	Yet in the latter days I will restore Moab from captivity,
c53081	declares the LORD.”
c53082	Here ends the judgment on Moab.
c53083	Concerning the Ammonites,
c53084	this is what the LORD says:
c53085	“Has Israel no sons?
c53086	Is he without heir?
c53087	Why then has Molech taken possession of Gad
c53088	and his people settled in their cities?
c53089	Therefore, behold, the days are coming,
c53090	declares the LORD,
c53091	when I will sound the battle cry against Rabbah of the Ammonites.
c53092	It will become a heap of ruins,
c53093	and its villages will be burned.
c53094	Then Israel will drive out their dispossessors,
c53095	says the LORD.
c53096	Wail,
c53097	O Heshbon,
c53098	for Ai has been destroyed;
c53099	cry out,
c53100	O daughters of Rabbah!
c53101	Put on sackcloth
c53102	and mourn;
c53103	run back and forth within your walls,
c53104	for Molech will go into exile
c53105	together with his priests and officials.
c53106	Why do you boast of your valleys,
c53107	your valleys so fruitful,
c53108	O faithless daughter?
c53109	You trust in your riches [and say],
c53110	‘Who can come against me?’
c53111	Behold, I am about to bring terror upon you,
c53112	declares the Lord GOD of Hosts,
c53113	from all those around you.
c53114	You will each be driven
c53115	headlong,
c53116	with no one to regather the fugitives.
c53117	Yet afterward I will restore the captivity of the Ammonites,
c53118	declares the LORD.
c53119	Concerning Edom,
c53120	this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c53121	“Is there no longer wisdom in Teman?
c53122	Has counsel perished from the prudent?
c53123	Has their wisdom decayed?
c53124	[and] run!
c53125	Turn
c53126	low,
c53127	Lie
c53128	O residents of Dedan,
c53129	for I will bring disaster on Esau
c53130	at the time
c53131	I punish him.
c53132	If grape gatherers came to you,
c53133	would they not leave some gleanings?
c53134	Were thieves to come in the night,
c53135	would they not steal only what they wanted?
c53136	But I will strip Esau bare;
c53137	I will uncover his hiding places,
c53138	to conceal himself.
c53139	and he will be unable
c53140	His descendants will be destroyed along with his relatives and neighbors,
c53141	and he will be no more.
c53142	Abandon your orphans;
c53143	I will preserve their lives.
c53144	Let your widows trust in Me.”
c53145	For this is what the LORD says:
c53146	“If
c53147	those who do not deserve
c53148	to drink the cup
c53149	must drink it,
c53150	can you
c53151	possibly remain unpunished?
c53152	You will not go unpunished,
c53153	for you must drink it too.
c53154	For by Myself I have sworn,
c53155	declares the LORD,
c53156	that Bozrah will become a desolation, a disgrace, a ruin, and a curse,
c53157	and all her cities will be in ruins forever.”
c53158	I have heard a message from the LORD;
c53159	an envoy has been sent among the nations
c53160	[to say,] “Assemble yourselves
c53161	to come against her!
c53162	Rise up for battle!”
c53163	“For behold, I will make you small among the nations,
c53164	despised among men.
c53165	The terror you cause ... have deceived you,
c53166	and the pride of your heart
c53167	O dwellers in the clefts of the rocks,
c53168	O occupiers of the mountain summit.
c53169	Though you elevate your nest like the eagle,
c53170	even from there I will bring you down,”
c53171	declares the LORD.
c53172	“Edom will become an object of horror.
c53173	Everyone
c53174	who passes by
c53175	will be appalled
c53176	and will scoff because of all its wounds.
c53177	As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown along with their neighbors,”
c53178	says the LORD,
c53179	“no one will reside there;
c53180	no man will dwell there.
c53181	Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan to the watered pasture.
c53182	Indeed, ... in an instant.
c53183	I will chase [Edom] from [its land]
c53184	Who is the chosen one
c53185	I will appoint for this?
c53186	For who is like Me?
c53187	Who will summon Me?
c53188	And what shepherd
c53189	can stand against Me?”
c53190	Therefore hear the plans ... the LORD
c53191	that ... has made against Edom
c53192	and the strategies
c53193	He has devised against the people of Teman:
c53194	The little ones of the flock ... be dragged away,
c53195	will surely ... and their pasture will be made desolate because of them.
c53196	At the sound of their fall,
c53197	the earth will quake;
c53198	their cry
c53199	will resound to the Red Sea.
c53200	Look! An eagle will soar,
c53201	then swoop down
c53202	and spread its wings over Bozrah.
c53203	In that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
c53204	Concerning Damascus:
c53205	“Hamath and Arpad are put to shame,
c53206	for they have heard a bad report;
c53207	they are agitated
c53208	like the sea; their anxiety
c53209	be calmed.
c53210	cannot
c53211	Damascus has become feeble;
c53212	she has turned
c53213	to flee.
c53214	Panic has gripped her;
c53215	anguish and pain have seized her like a woman in labor.
c53216	How is the city of praise not forsaken,
c53217	the town that brings Me joy?
c53218	For her young men will fall in her streets;
c53219	all the warriors will be silenced in that day.”
c53220	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c53221	“I will set fire to the walls of Damascus;
c53222	it will consume the fortresses of Ben-hadad.”
c53223	Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor,
c53224	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated,
c53225	this is what the LORD says:
c53226	“Rise up,
c53227	advance against Kedar,
c53228	and destroy the people of the east!
c53229	They will take their tents and flocks,
c53230	their tent curtains and all their goods. They will take their camels for themselves.
c53231	They will shout to them:
c53232	‘Terror is on every side!’
c53233	Run!
c53234	Escape quickly!
c53235	low,
c53236	Lie
c53237	O residents of Hazor,
c53238	declares the LORD,
c53239	for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has drawn up a plan against you;
c53240	he has devised a strategy against you.
c53241	Rise up,
c53242	advance against a nation at ease,
c53243	one that dwells securely,
c53244	declares the LORD.
c53245	They have no gates
c53246	or bars;
c53247	they live alone.
c53248	Their camels will become plunder,
c53249	and their large herds will be spoil.
c53250	I will scatter to the wind in every direction those who shave their temples;
c53251	I will bring calamity on them from all sides,
c53252	declares the LORD.
c53253	Hazor will become a haunt of jackals,
c53254	a desolation forever.
c53255	No one will reside there;
c53256	no man will dwell there.”
c53257	This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah.
c53259	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c53260	“Behold, I will shatter Elam’s bow, the mainstay of their might.
c53261	I will bring the four winds against Elam from the four corners of the heavens,
c53262	and I will scatter them to all these winds.
c53263	There will not be a nation
c53264	to which Elam’s exiles will not go.
c53265	So I will shatter Elam before their foes, before those who seek their lives.
c53266	I will bring disaster upon them, even My fierce anger,
c53267	declares the LORD.
c53268	I will send out the sword after them
c53269	until I finish them off.
c53270	I will set My throne in Elam,
c53271	and destroy its king and officials,
c53272	declares the LORD.
c53273	Yet in the last days,
c53274	I will restore Elam from captivity,”
c53275	declares the LORD.
c53276	[This is] the word
c53277	that the LORD spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Chaldeans:
c53278	“Announce ... to the nations;
c53279	and declare
c53280	lift up a banner
c53281	and proclaim it;
c53282	hold nothing back
c53283	when you say,
c53284	‘Babylon is captured;
c53285	Bel is put to shame;
c53286	Marduk is shattered,
c53287	her images are disgraced,
c53288	her idols are broken in pieces.’
c53289	For a nation from the north will come against her;
c53290	it will make her land an object of horror.
c53291	No one will live in it; both man and beast
c53292	will flee.”
c53294	“In those days and at that time,
c53295	declares the LORD,
c53296	the children of Israel and the children of Judah will come together,
c53297	weeping as they come,
c53298	and will seek the LORD their God.
c53299	to Zion
c53300	They will ask the way
c53301	[and turn] their faces toward it.
c53302	They will come
c53303	and join themselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant
c53304	that will never be forgotten.
c53305	My people are lost sheep;
c53306	their shepherds have led them astray,
c53307	causing them to roam the mountains.
c53308	They have wandered from mountain to hill;
c53309	they have forgotten their resting place.
c53310	All who found them devoured them,
c53311	and their enemies said,
c53312	‘We are not guilty,
c53313	for they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of righteousness, the LORD, the hope of their fathers.’
c53314	Flee from the midst of Babylon;
c53315	depart from the land of the Chaldeans;
c53316	be like the he-goats that lead the flock.
c53317	For behold, I stir up
c53318	and bring against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the land of the north.
c53319	They will line up against her;
c53320	from [the north] she will be captured.
c53321	Their arrows will be like skilled warriors
c53322	who do not return empty-handed.
c53323	Chaldea will be plundered;
c53324	all who plunder her will have their fill,”
c53325	declares the LORD.
c53326	“Because you rejoice,
c53327	because you sing in triumph—
c53328	you who plunder My inheritance—
c53329	because you frolic like a heifer treading grain
c53330	and neigh like stallions,
c53331	your mother will be greatly ashamed;
c53332	she who bore you will be disgraced.
c53333	Behold, [she will be] the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
c53334	Because of the wrath of the LORD, she will not be inhabited;
c53335	she will become ... desolate.
c53336	completely
c53337	All
c53338	who pass through Babylon
c53339	will be horrified
c53340	and scoff at all her wounds.
c53341	Line up in formation around Babylon,
c53342	all you who draw the bow!
c53343	Shoot at her!
c53344	Spare no arrows!
c53345	For she has sinned against the LORD.
c53346	Raise a war cry against her on every side!
c53347	She has thrown up her hands in surrender;
c53348	her towers have fallen;
c53349	her walls are torn down.
c53350	Since this is the vengeance of the LORD,
c53351	take out your vengeance upon her;
c53352	as she has done,
c53353	do the same to her.
c53354	Cut off the sower from Babylon,
c53355	and the one who wields the sickle at harvest time.
c53356	In the face of the oppressor’s sword,
c53357	each ... to his own people,
c53358	will turn
c53360	each ... to his own land.
c53361	will flee
c53362	Israel is a scattered flock,
c53363	chased away by lions.
c53364	The first
c53365	to devour him was the king of Assyria;
c53366	the last
c53367	to crush his bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.”
c53368	Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c53369	“I will punish the king of Babylon and his land
c53370	as I punished the king of Assyria.
c53371	I will return Israel to his pasture,
c53372	and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan; ... on the hills of Ephraim
c53373	his soul will be satisfied ... and Gilead.
c53374	In those days and at that time,
c53375	declares the LORD,
c53376	a search will transpire for Israel’s guilt,
c53377	but there will be none,
c53378	and for Judah’s sins,
c53379	but they will not be found;
c53380	for I will forgive
c53381	the remnant I spare.”
c53382	against the land of Merathaim,
c53383	“Go up ... and against the residents of Pekod.
c53384	Put them to the sword
c53385	and completely destroy them,”
c53386	declares the LORD.
c53387	“Do everything
c53388	I have commanded you.
c53389	The noise of battle is in the land—
c53390	[the noise] of great destruction.
c53391	How ... lies broken
c53392	the hammer of the whole earth ... and shattered!
c53393	What a horror Babylon has become among the nations!
c53394	I laid a snare for you,
c53395	and you were caught
c53396	O Babylon,
c53397	before you knew it.
c53398	You were found
c53399	and captured
c53400	because you challenged the LORD.
c53401	The LORD has opened His armory
c53402	and brought out His weapons of wrath,
c53403	for ... [is] the work
c53404	it ... of the Lord GOD of Hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
c53405	Come against her from the farthest border.
c53406	Break open her granaries;
c53407	pile her up like mounds of grain.
c53408	Completely destroy her;
c53409	leave her no survivors.
c53410	Put all her young bulls to the sword;
c53411	let them go down to the slaughter.
c53412	Woe to them,
c53413	for their day has come— the time of their punishment.
c53414	Listen to the fugitives and refugees from the land of Babylon,
c53415	declaring in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance for His temple.
c53416	Summon ... against Babylon,
c53417	the archers ... all who string the bow.
c53418	Encamp all around her;
c53419	let no one escape.
c53420	Repay her according to her deeds;
c53421	as
c53422	she has done.
c53423	do to her
c53424	For she has defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
c53425	Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets;
c53426	all her soldiers will perish in that day,”
c53427	declares the LORD.
c53428	“Behold, I am against you,
c53429	O arrogant one,
c53430	declares the Lord GOD of Hosts,
c53431	because your day has come, the time
c53432	when I will punish you.
c53433	The arrogant one will stumble
c53434	and fall
c53435	with no one to pick him up.
c53436	And I will kindle a fire in his cities
c53437	to consume all those around him.”
c53438	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c53439	“The sons of Israel are oppressed, and the sons of Judah as well.
c53440	All their captors hold them fast,
c53441	refusing
c53442	to release them.
c53443	Their Redeemer is strong;
c53444	the LORD of Hosts is His name.
c53445	He will fervently plead their case
c53446	so that He may bring rest to the earth,
c53447	but turmoil to those who live in Babylon.
c53448	A sword [is] against the Chaldeans,
c53449	declares the LORD,
c53450	against those who live in Babylon, and against her officials and wise men.
c53451	A sword [is] against her diviners,
c53452	and they will become fools.
c53453	A sword is against her warriors,
c53454	and they will be filled with terror.
c53455	A sword is against her horses and chariots and against all the foreigners ... is against
c53456	in her midst,
c53457	and they will become like women.
c53458	A sword ... her treasuries,
c53459	and they will be plundered.
c53460	A drought [is] upon her waters,
c53461	and they will be dried up.
c53462	For it is a land of graven images,
c53463	and [the people] go mad over idols.
c53464	So the desert creatures and hyenas will live there
c53465	and ostriches will dwell there.
c53466	It will never again be inhabited
c53467	or settled from generation to generation.
c53468	As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns,
c53469	declares the LORD,
c53470	no one will reside there;
c53471	no man will dwell there.
c53472	Behold! A people comes from the north.
c53473	A great nation and many kings will be stirred up from the remote regions of the earth.
c53474	They grasp the bow and javelin.
c53475	They are cruel
c53476	and without mercy.
c53477	Their voice roars like the sea,
c53478	and they ride on horses,
c53479	lined up like men in battle formation against you,
c53480	O Daughter of Babylon.
c53481	The king of Babylon has heard the report,
c53482	and his hands hang limp.
c53483	Distress has seized him,
c53484	pain like that of a woman in labor.
c53485	Behold, one will come like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan to the watered pasture.
c53486	For in an instant
c53487	I will chase [Babylon] from her land.
c53489	Who is the chosen one
c53490	I will appoint over her?
c53491	For who is like Me,
c53492	and who can challenge Me?
c53493	What shepherd
c53494	can stand against Me?”
c53495	Therefore, hear the plans ... the LORD
c53496	that ... has drawn up against Babylon
c53497	and the strategies
c53498	He has devised against the land of the Chaldeans:
c53499	Surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged away;
c53500	certainly their pasture will be made desolate because of them.
c53501	At the sound
c53502	of Babylon’s capture
c53503	the earth will quake;
c53504	a cry will be heard among the nations.
c53505	This is what the LORD says:
c53506	“Behold, I will stir up against Babylon and against the people of Leb-kamai the spirit of a destroyer.
c53507	I will send strangers to Babylon
c53508	to winnow her
c53509	and empty her land;
c53510	for they will come against her from every side in the day of [her] disaster.
c53511	Do not let the archer
c53512	bend his bow
c53513	[or] put on his armor. Do not
c53514	spare her young men;
c53515	completely destroy her army!
c53516	And they will fall slain in the land of the Chaldeans,
c53517	and pierced through in her streets.
c53518	For Israel and Judah have not been abandoned by their God, the LORD of Hosts,
c53519	though their land is full of guilt before the Holy One of Israel.”
c53520	Flee from Babylon;
c53521	escape with your lives!
c53522	Do not be destroyed in her punishment.
c53523	For this is the time of the LORD’s vengeance;
c53524	He will pay her what she deserves.
c53525	Babylon was a gold cup in the hand of the LORD,
c53526	making the whole earth drunk.
c53527	The nations drank her wine;
c53528	therefore the nations have gone mad.
c53529	Suddenly Babylon has fallen
c53530	and been shattered.
c53531	Wail for her;
c53532	get her balm for her pain;
c53533	perhaps she can be healed.
c53534	“We tried to heal Babylon,
c53535	but she could not be healed.
c53536	Abandon her!
c53537	of us go
c53538	Let each ... to his own land,
c53539	for her judgment extends to the sky
c53540	and reaches to the clouds.”
c53541	The LORD has brought forth our vindication;
c53542	come,
c53543	let us tell in Zion what the LORD our God has accomplished.
c53544	Sharpen the arrows!
c53545	Take up the shields!
c53546	The LORD has aroused the spirit of the kings of the Medes,
c53547	because His plan is aimed at Babylon
c53548	to destroy her,
c53549	for it [is] the vengeance of the LORD—
c53550	vengeance for His temple.
c53551	Raise a banner against the walls of Babylon;
c53552	post the guard;
c53553	station the watchmen;
c53554	prepare the ambush.
c53555	For the LORD has both devised
c53556	and accomplished
c53557	what He spoke against the people of Babylon.
c53558	You who dwell by many waters,
c53559	rich in treasures,
c53560	your end has come,
c53561	the thread of your life is cut.
c53562	The LORD of Hosts has sworn by Himself:
c53563	“Surely I will fill you up with men like locusts,
c53564	and they will shout in triumph over you.”
c53565	He made the earth by His power;
c53566	He established the world by His wisdom
c53567	and stretched out the heavens by His understanding.
c53568	When He thunders,
c53570	the waters in the heavens roar,
c53571	and He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth.
c53572	He makes lightning for the rain
c53573	and brings forth the wind from His storehouses.
c53574	Every man is senseless and devoid of knowledge.
c53575	Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols,
c53576	for his molten images are a lie,
c53577	and [there is] no breath in them.
c53578	They are worthless,
c53579	a work to be mocked.
c53580	In the time of their punishment they will perish.
c53581	Jacob’s Portion is not like these,
c53582	for He is the Maker of all things,
c53583	and of the tribe of His inheritance—
c53584	the LORD of Hosts is His name.
c53585	“You are My war club,
c53586	My weapon for battle.
c53587	With you I shatter nations;
c53588	with you I bring kingdoms to ruin.
c53589	With you I shatter the horse and rider;
c53590	with you I shatter the chariot and driver.
c53591	With you I shatter man and woman;
c53592	with you I shatter the old man and the youth;
c53593	with you I shatter the young man and the maiden.
c53594	With you I shatter the shepherd and his flock;
c53595	with you I shatter the farmer and his oxen;
c53596	with you I shatter the governors and officials.
c53597	I will repay Babylon and all the residents of Chaldea for all the evil
c53598	they have done in Zion,”
c53599	Before your very eyes
c53600	declares the LORD.
c53601	“Behold, I am against you,
c53602	O destroying mountain,
c53603	declares the LORD.
c53604	you who devastate the whole earth,
c53605	I will stretch out My hand against you;
c53606	I will roll you over the cliffs,
c53607	and turn you into a charred mountain.
c53608	No one shall retrieve from you a cornerstone or a foundation stone,
c53609	because you will become desolate forever,”
c53610	declares the LORD.
c53611	“Raise a banner in the land!
c53612	Blow the trumpet among the nations!
c53613	Prepare the nations against her.
c53614	Summon the kingdoms against her— Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.
c53615	Appoint a captain against her;
c53616	bring up horses like swarming locusts.
c53617	Prepare the nations for battle against her— the kings of the Medes, their governors and all their officials, and all the lands they rule.
c53618	The earth quakes
c53619	and writhes
c53620	because the LORD’s intentions against Babylon stand:
c53621	to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without an inhabitant.
c53622	The warriors of Babylon have stopped
c53623	fighting;
c53624	they sit in their strongholds.
c53625	Their strength is exhausted;
c53626	they have become like women.
c53627	Babylon’s homes have been set ablaze,
c53628	the bars of her gates are broken.
c53629	One courier
c53630	races to meet
c53631	another,
c53632	and messenger
c53633	follows messenger,
c53634	to announce to the king of Babylon
c53635	that his city has been captured from end to end.
c53636	The fords have been seized,
c53637	the marshes set on fire,
c53638	and the soldiers are terrified.”
c53639	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
c53640	“The Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor
c53641	at the time
c53642	it is trampled.
c53643	In just a little while
c53644	her harvest time will come.”
c53645	has devoured me;
c53646	“Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ... he has crushed me.
c53647	He has set me aside like an empty vessel;
c53648	he has swallowed me like a monster;
c53649	he filled his belly with my delicacies
c53650	[and] vomited me out.
c53651	May the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon,”
c53652	says the inhabitant of Zion.
c53653	“May my blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea,”
c53654	says Jerusalem.
c53655	Therefore, this is what the LORD says:
c53656	“Behold, I will plead your case
c53657	and take vengeance on your behalf;
c53658	I will dry up her sea
c53659	and make her springs run dry.
c53660	Babylon will become a heap of rubble, a haunt of jackals, an object of horror and scorn, without inhabitant.
c53661	They will roar together like young lions;
c53662	they will growl like lion cubs.
c53663	While they are flushed with heat,
c53664	I will serve them a feast,
c53665	and I will make them drunk
c53666	so that they may revel;
c53667	then they will fall asleep forever
c53668	and never wake up,
c53669	declares the LORD.
c53670	I will bring them down like lambs
c53671	to the slaughter,
c53672	like rams with male goats.”
c53673	How Sheshach has been captured!
c53674	The praise of the whole earth has been seized.
c53675	What a horror Babylon has become among the nations!
c53676	The sea has come up over Babylon;
c53677	she is covered in turbulent waves.
c53678	Her cities have become a desolation, a dry and arid land, a land
c53679	where no one lives,
c53680	where no son of man passes through.
c53681	I will punish Bel in Babylon.
c53682	I will make him spew out what he swallowed.
c53683	The nations will no longer stream to him;
c53684	even the wall of Babylon will fall.
c53685	Come out from among her,
c53686	My people!
c53687	Save
c53688	your lives, each of you,
c53689	from the fierce anger of the LORD.
c53690	Do not let your heart grow faint,
c53691	and do not be afraid when the rumor
c53692	is heard in the land;
c53693	for a rumor will come one year,
c53694	and then another the next year
c53695	of violence in the land
c53696	and ruler against ruler.
c53697	Therefore, behold, the days are coming
c53698	when I will punish the idols of Babylon.
c53699	Her entire land will suffer shame,
c53700	and all her slain will lie fallen within her.
c53701	Then heaven and earth and all ... will shout for joy over Babylon
c53702	that is in them
c53703	because the destroyers from the north will come against her,”
c53704	declares the LORD.
c53705	Babylon ... just as
c53706	must fall on account of the slain of Israel,
c53707	the slain of all the earth have fallen because of Babylon.
c53708	You who have escaped the sword,
c53709	depart
c53710	and do not linger!
c53711	Remember the LORD from far away,
c53712	and let Jerusalem come to mind.
c53713	“We are ashamed
c53714	because we have heard reproach;
c53715	disgrace has covered our faces,
c53716	because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD’s house.”
c53717	“Therefore, behold, the days are coming,”
c53718	declares the LORD,
c53719	“when I will punish her idols,
c53720	and throughout her land the wounded will groan.
c53721	Even if Babylon should ascend to the heavens
c53722	and fortify her lofty stronghold,
c53723	the destroyers I send will come against her,
c53724	declares the LORD.
c53725	The sound of a cry [comes from] Babylon,
c53726	the sound of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
c53727	For the LORD will destroy Babylon;
c53728	He will silence her mighty voice.
c53729	The waves will roar like great waters;
c53730	the tumult of their voice will resound.
c53731	For a destroyer is coming against her— against Babylon.
c53732	Her warriors will be captured,
c53733	[and] their bows will be broken,
c53734	for the LORD is a God of retribution; He will repay in full.
c53735	I will make her princes and wise men drunk, along with her governors, officials, and warriors.
c53736	Then they will fall asleep forever
c53737	and not wake up,”
c53738	declares the King,
c53739	whose name is the LORD of Hosts.
c53740	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c53741	“Babylon’s thick walls will be leveled,
c53742	and her high gates consumed by fire.
c53743	So the labor of the people will be for nothing;
c53744	the nations ... to fuel the flames.”
c53745	will exhaust themselves
c53746	[This is] the command
c53747	that Jeremiah the prophet gave ... Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah,
c53748	when he went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah in the fourth year
c53749	of Zedekiah’s reign.
c53750	to the quartermaster
c53751	Jeremiah had written ... about all the disaster
c53752	on ... that would come ... Babylon—
c53753	a single scroll ... upon ... all these words
c53754	that had been written concerning Babylon.
c53755	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah,
c53756	“When you get to Babylon,
c53757	see
c53758	that you read all these words aloud,
c53759	and say,
c53760	‘O LORD,
c53761	You have promised ... this place
c53762	to cut off
c53763	so that no one will remain— neither man nor beast. ... it will be
c53764	Indeed, ... desolate forever.’
c53766	When you finish
c53767	reading this scroll,
c53768	tie a stone to it
c53769	and cast it into the Euphrates.
c53770	Then you are to say,
c53771	‘In the same way, Babylon will sink
c53772	and never rise again, because of the disaster
c53773	I will bring upon her.
c53774	And [her people] will grow weary.’”
c53775	Here end the words of Jeremiah.
c53776	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old
c53777	when he became king,
c53778	and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.
c53779	His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
c53780	And [Zedekiah] did
c53781	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c53782	just as
c53783	Jehoiakim had done.
c53784	For because of the anger of the LORD, [all this] happened in Jerusalem and Judah,
c53785	until He finally banished them from His presence.
c53786	And Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon.
c53787	So in the ninth year
c53788	of Zedekiah’s reign,
c53789	on the tenth day of the tenth month,
c53790	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army.
c53791	They encamped outside [the city]
c53792	and built a siege wall all around it.
c53793	And the city was kept under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
c53794	By the ninth [day] of the fourth month,
c53795	the famine in the city was so severe
c53796	that the people of the land had no food.
c53797	Then the city was breached,
c53798	all the men of war fled.
c53799	the city by night by way of the gate between the two walls
c53800	near the king’s garden.
c53801	and though the Chaldeans had surrounded the city,
c53802	They fled toward the Arabah,
c53803	but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king
c53804	and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho,
c53805	and all his army was separated from him.
c53806	[The Chaldeans] seized the king
c53807	and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath,
c53808	where he pronounced judgment on [Zedekiah].
c53809	the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes,
c53810	There at Riblah ... and he also killed all the officials of Judah.
c53811	Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes,
c53812	bound ... in bronze shackles
c53813	him ... and took him to Babylon, [where]
c53814	he kept him in custody until his dying day.
c53815	On the tenth day of the fifth month,
c53816	in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign over Babylon,
c53817	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, ... entered
c53818	a servant of the king of Babylon,
c53819	Jerusalem.
c53820	He burned down the house of the LORD, the royal palace,
c53821	and all the houses of Jerusalem— every significant building.
c53822	And the whole army of the Chaldeans ... broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
c53823	under the captain of the guard
c53824	[some of] the poorest people and those who remained
c53825	in the city,
c53826	along with the deserters
c53827	who had defected to the king of Babylon
c53828	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile ... and the rest of the craftsmen.
c53829	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left behind [the rest of] the poor of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.
c53830	Moreover, ... the bronze pillars
c53832	and the stands and the bronze sea
c53833	in the house of the LORD,
c53834	the Chaldeans broke up
c53835	and they carried all the bronze to Babylon.
c53836	the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, dishes, and all the articles of bronze
c53837	used in the temple service.
c53838	They also took away
c53839	the bowls, censers, sprinkling basins, pots, lampstands, pans, and drink offering bowls—
c53840	anything [made of] pure gold
c53841	or fine silver.
c53842	The captain of the guard also took away
c53843	As for the two pillars, the sea, the twelve bronze bulls
c53844	under it, and the movable stands that
c53845	King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD,
c53846	the weight of the bronze from all these articles was beyond measure.
c53847	pillar
c53848	Each ... [was] eighteen cubits tall
c53849	and twelve cubits in circumference;
c53850	four fingers thick.
c53851	[each] was hollow,
c53852	The bronze capital atop
c53853	one [pillar] [was] five cubits high,
c53854	with a network ... pomegranates all around.
c53855	of bronze
c53856	The second pillar, with [its] pomegranates, [was] similar.
c53857	[Each capital had] ninety-six pomegranates
c53858	all around it. All the pomegranates around the latticework [numbered] a hundred.
c53859	The captain of the guard also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three doorkeepers.
c53860	Of those still in the city, he took a court official
c53861	who had been appointed over the men
c53862	seven trusted royal advisers,
c53864	as well as the scribe of the captain of the army,
c53865	who enlisted the people of the land,
c53866	of war, ... and sixty men
c53867	who were found in the city.
c53868	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them
c53869	and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
c53870	The king of Babylon struck them {down}
c53871	There at Riblah in the land of Hamath, ... and put them to death.
c53872	So Judah was taken into exile, away from her land.
c53873	These are the people
c53874	Nebuchadnezzar carried away: in the seventh year,
c53875	3,023 Jews;
c53876	in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;
c53877	in Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away 745 Jews. ... people [were taken away].
c53878	So altogether, 4,600
c53879	Now on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah,
c53880	in the first year of the reign of Evil-merodach king of Babylon, he pardoned Jehoiachin king of Judah
c53881	and released him from prison.
c53882	He spoke kindly [to Jehoiachin]
c53883	and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings
c53884	with [him] in Babylon.
c53885	So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes,
c53886	and he dined regularly at the king’s table for the rest of his days.
c53887	allotted
c53888	And the king of Babylon ... to him a daily portion for the rest of his life, until the day of his death.
c53889	In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day,
c53890	while I was among the exiles by the River Kebar,
c53891	the heavens opened
c53892	and I saw visions of God.
c53893	On the fifth day of the month—
c53894	it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin—
c53895	the word of the LORD came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Kebar River.
c53896	And there the LORD’s hand was upon him.
c53897	I looked
c53898	and saw
c53899	a whirlwind coming from the north,
c53900	a great cloud
c53901	with fire flashing back and forth
c53902	and brilliant light all around it.
c53903	In the center of the fire was a glow like amber,
c53904	and within it [was] the form of four living creatures.
c53905	And this [was] their appearance:
c53906	They had a human form,
c53907	but each had four faces
c53908	and four wings.
c53909	Their legs were straight, ... of their feet
c53910	and the soles ... were like the hooves of a calf,
c53911	gleaming like polished bronze.
c53912	Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands.
c53913	All four of them had faces and wings,
c53914	were touching
c53915	one another.
c53916	and their wings
c53917	They did not turn
c53918	as they moved;
c53919	each ... straight ahead.
c53920	one went
c53921	The form of their faces was that of a man,
c53922	and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side,
c53923	the face of an ox on the left side, and also
c53924	the face of an eagle.
c53925	Such were their faces.
c53926	Their wings were spread upward;
c53927	each [had] two [wings]
c53928	touching the wings of the creature on either side,
c53929	and two wings covering its body.
c53931	Each ... straight ahead.
c53932	[creature] went
c53933	Wherever the spirit
c53934	would go,
c53935	they would go,
c53936	without turning
c53937	as they moved.
c53938	In the midst of the living creatures
c53939	was the appearance of glowing coals
c53940	of fire, [or] of torches.
c53941	moved back and forth between the living creatures;
c53942	Fire ... it was bright,
c53943	and lightning flashed out of it.
c53944	The creatures
c53945	were darting back and forth
c53947	as quickly as flashes of lightning.
c53948	When I looked at the living creatures,
c53949	I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.
c53950	The workmanship of the wheels looked like the gleam of beryl,
c53951	and all four had the same likeness.
c53952	Their workmanship looked
c53953	like a wheel within a wheel.
c53954	in any of the four directions,
c53955	As they moved,
c53956	they went
c53957	without pivoting
c53958	as they moved.
c53959	Their rims
c53960	were high
c53961	and awesome,
c53962	and all four rims were full of eyes all around.
c53963	So as the living creatures moved,
c53964	the wheels moved beside them,
c53965	and when the creatures rose from the ground,
c53966	the wheels also rose.
c53967	Wherever the spirit
c53968	would go,
c53969	they would go,
c53972	and the wheels would rise alongside them,
c53973	because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
c53974	When the creatures moved,
c53975	the wheels moved;
c53976	when the creatures stood still,
c53977	the wheels stood still;
c53978	and when the creatures rose from the ground,
c53979	the wheels rose alongside them,
c53980	because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
c53981	above the heads of the living creatures [was] the shape on an awesome expanse, gleaming like crystal.
c53982	Spread out
c53983	And under the expanse, their wings stretched out
c53984	toward one another.
c53985	Each one also had two wings covering
c53986	its body.
c53987	I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty,
c53988	When [the creatures] moved,
c53989	like the tumult of an army.
c53990	When they stood still,
c53991	they lowered their wings.
c53992	a voice came from above the expanse
c53993	that [was] over their heads.
c53994	And as they stood still
c53995	with their wings lowered,
c53996	Above the expanse
c53997	over their heads [was]
c53998	the likeness of a throne with the appearance of sapphire,
c53999	[and] on the throne high above was a figure like that of a man.
c54000	I saw a gleam like amber,
c54001	From what seemed ... like fire
c54002	within it all around.
c54003	to be His waist up, ... with what looked
c54004	And from what seemed to be His waist down,
c54005	I saw what looked like fire;
c54006	and brilliant light surrounded Him.
c54007	The appearance ... of a rainbow
c54008	in a cloud on a rainy day.
c54009	of the brilliant light all around Him was like that
c54010	This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.
c54011	And when I saw it,
c54012	I fell facedown
c54013	and heard a voice
c54014	speaking.
c54015	He said to me,
c54016	“Son of man,”
c54017	“stand up on your feet
c54018	and I will speak to you.”
c54019	the Spirit entered me
c54020	And as He spoke to me,
c54021	and set me on my feet,
c54022	and I heard [Him] speaking to me.
c54023	He said to me:
c54024	“Son of man,”
c54025	“I am sending you to the Israelites, to ... nation
c54026	a rebellious
c54027	that has rebelled against Me.
c54028	To this very day the Israelites and their fathers have transgressed against Me.
c54029	They are obstinate and hardhearted children.
c54030	I am sending you to them,
c54031	and you are to say to them,
c54032	‘This is what the Lord GOD says.’
c54033	they
c54034	And whether ... listen
c54035	or refuse to listen—
c54036	for they are a rebellious house—
c54037	they will know
c54038	that a prophet has been among them.
c54039	But you,
c54040	son of man,
c54041	do not be afraid of them
c54042	or their words. Do not be afraid,
c54043	though briers and thorns surround
c54044	you, and you dwell among scorpions.
c54045	Do not be afraid of their words
c54046	or dismayed by their presence,
c54047	though they are a rebellious house.
c54048	But speak My words to them,
c54049	whether they listen
c54050	or refuse
c54051	to listen, for they are rebellious.
c54052	But you,
c54053	son of man,
c54054	listen
c54055	to what I tell you.
c54056	Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house.
c54057	Open your mouth
c54058	and eat
c54059	what I give you.”
c54060	Then I looked
c54061	and saw
c54062	a hand reaching out to me,
c54063	and
c54064	in it was a scroll,
c54065	which He unrolled before me.
c54066	And written on the front and back
c54067	of it [were] words of lamentation, mourning, and woe.
c54068	He said to me,
c54069	“Son of man,”
c54070	what you find here.
c54071	“eat
c54072	Eat this scroll,
c54073	then go
c54074	and speak to the house of Israel.”
c54075	So I opened my mouth,
c54076	and He fed me the scroll.
c54077	He said to me,
c54078	“Son of man,”
c54079	“eat
c54080	and fill your stomach with this scroll
c54081	I am giving you.”
c54082	So I ate,
c54083	and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.
c54084	Then He said to me,
c54085	“Son of man,
c54086	go now
c54087	to the house of Israel
c54088	and speak My words to them.
c54089	For you are not being sent to a people of unfamiliar speech or difficult language,
c54090	but to the house of Israel—
c54091	not to many peoples of unfamiliar speech or difficult language,
c54092	whose words you cannot understand.
c54093	Surely if I had sent you to them,
c54094	they would have listened to you.
c54095	But the house of Israel will be unwilling
c54096	to listen to you,
c54097	since they are unwilling
c54098	to listen to Me.
c54099	For the whole house of Israel
c54100	is stubborn and obstinate.
c54101	Behold, I will make your face as hard as their faces,
c54102	and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
c54103	I will make your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint.
c54104	Do not be afraid of them
c54105	[or] dismayed at their presence,
c54106	even though they are a rebellious house.”
c54107	He added,
c54108	“Son of man,”
c54109	to all the words
c54110	I speak to you,
c54111	and take them to heart.
c54112	“listen carefully
c54114	Go to your people, the exiles; ... to them
c54115	speak
c54116	and tell them,
c54117	‘This is what the Lord GOD says,’
c54118	whether they listen
c54119	or refuse to listen.”
c54120	Then the Spirit lifted me up,
c54121	and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me—
c54122	blessed be the glory of the LORD in His dwelling place!—
c54123	the sound of the wings of the living creatures
c54124	brushing
c54125	against one another
c54126	and the sound of the wheels beside them,
c54127	a great rumbling sound.
c54128	So the Spirit lifted me up
c54129	and took me away,
c54130	and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit,
c54131	with the strong hand of the LORD upon me.
c54132	I came to the exiles at Tel-abib
c54133	who dwelt by the River Kebar.
c54134	I sat
c54135	where they sat
c54136	And for seven days ... and remained there among them, overwhelmed.
c54137	At the end of seven days ... came
c54138	the word of the LORD ... to me
c54139	saying,
c54140	“Son of man,
c54141	I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel.
c54142	Whenever you hear a word from My mouth,
c54143	give them a warning from Me.
c54144	If I say to the wicked man,
c54145	‘You will surely die,’
c54146	but you do not warn him
c54147	[or] speak out
c54148	to warn him from his wicked way
c54149	to save his life,
c54150	that wicked man will die in his iniquity,
c54151	and I will hold you responsible for his blood.
c54152	you
c54153	But if ... warn a wicked man
c54154	and he does not turn from his wickedness and his wicked way,
c54155	he will die in his iniquity,
c54156	but you will have saved yourself.
c54158	Now if a righteous man turns from his righteousness
c54159	and commits iniquity,
c54160	and I put a stumbling block before him,
c54161	he will die.
c54162	If you did not warn him,
c54163	he will die in his sin,
c54164	and the righteous acts ... will not be remembered.
c54165	he did
c54166	And I will hold you responsible for his blood.
c54167	you
c54168	But if ... warn the righteous man
c54169	not to sin,
c54170	and he does not sin,
c54171	he will indeed live
c54172	because he heeded your warning,
c54173	and you will have saved yourself.”
c54174	And there the hand of the LORD was upon me,
c54175	and He said to me,
c54176	“Get up,
c54177	go out to the plain,
c54178	and there I will speak with you.”
c54179	So I got up
c54180	and went out to the plain,
c54181	and behold, the glory of the LORD was present there, like the glory
c54182	I had seen by the River Kebar,
c54183	and I fell facedown.
c54184	Then the Spirit entered me
c54185	and set me on my feet.
c54186	He spoke with
c54187	me and said:
c54188	“Go,
c54189	shut yourself inside your house.
c54190	And you,
c54191	son of man,
c54192	they will tie with ropes,
c54193	and you will be bound
c54194	so that you cannot go out among [the people].
c54195	I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth,
c54196	and you will be silent
c54197	and unable
c54198	to rebuke them,
c54199	though they are a rebellious house.
c54201	But when I speak with you,
c54202	I will open your mouth,
c54203	and you are to tell them,
c54204	‘This is what the Lord GOD says.’
c54205	let him listen;
c54206	Whoever listens,
c54207	and whoever refuses, let him refuse;
c54208	for they are a rebellious house.
c54209	Now you,
c54210	son of man,
c54211	take a brick,
c54212	place it before you,
c54213	and draw on it the city of Jerusalem.
c54214	Then lay siege against it:
c54215	Construct a siege wall, ... around it
c54216	build a ramp to it,
c54217	set up camps against it,
c54218	and place battering rams ... on all sides.
c54219	Then
c54220	take an iron plate
c54221	and set it up as an iron wall between yourself and the city.
c54222	Turn your face toward it
c54223	so that it is under siege,
c54224	and besiege it.
c54225	This will be a sign to the house of Israel.
c54227	Then lie down on your left side
c54228	and place the iniquity of the house of Israel upon yourself.
c54229	for the number of days
c54230	you lie on your side.
c54231	You are to bear their iniquity
c54232	For I have assigned you the years of their iniquity according to the number of days you lie down, 390 days;
c54233	so you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
c54234	When you have completed these days,
c54235	lie down again, but on your right side,
c54236	and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. ... 40 days,
c54237	a day for each year.
c54238	I have assigned to you
c54239	You must turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem
c54240	with your arm bared,
c54241	and prophesy against it.
c54242	Now behold, I will tie you up with ropes
c54243	so you cannot turn from side to side
c54244	until you have finished the days of your siege.
c54245	vvv
c54246	But take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt;
c54247	put them in a single container
c54248	and make them into bread for yourself.
c54249	during the
c54250	that you lie on your side.
c54251	[This is what] you are to eat ... 390 days
c54252	of food
c54253	to eat
c54254	You are to weigh out
c54255	twenty shekels ... each day,
c54256	and you are to eat it at set times.
c54257	You are also to measure out ... of water to drink,
c54258	a sixth of a hin
c54259	and you are to drink it at set times.
c54260	as you would a barley cake,
c54261	And you shall eat
c54262	[the food]
c54263	after you bake it over dried human excrement in the sight [of the people].”
c54264	Then the LORD said,
c54265	“This is how the Israelites will eat their defiled bread among the nations
c54266	to which I will banish them.”
c54267	I said,
c54268	“Ah, Lord GOD,”
c54269	“I have never defiled myself.
c54270	From my youth until now I have not eaten anything found dead or mauled by wild beasts.
c54271	No unclean meat has ever entered my mouth.”
c54272	He replied,
c54273	“Look,”
c54274	“I will let you use cow dung instead of human excrement,
c54275	and you may bake your bread over that.”
c54276	Then He told me,
c54277	“Son of man,
c54278	I am going to cut off the supply of food in Jerusalem.
c54279	They will anxiously eat bread rationed by weight,
c54280	and in despair they will drink water by measure.
c54281	So they will lack food and water;
c54282	they will be appalled [over the sight of] one another
c54283	wasting away in their iniquity.
c54284	Now you,
c54285	son of man,
c54286	take a sharp sword,
c54287	it as a barber’s razor,
c54288	use
c54289	and shave your head and beard.
c54290	Then take a set of scales
c54291	and divide the hair.
c54292	you are to burn up a third [of the hair] inside the city;
c54293	When the days of the siege have ended,
c54294	you are also to take a third
c54295	and slash it with the sword all around the city;
c54296	and you are to scatter a third to the wind.
c54297	For I will unleash a sword behind them.
c54298	But you are to take a few strands of hair
c54299	and secure them in the folds of your garment.
c54300	Again, take a few of these,
c54301	throw them into the fire,
c54302	and burn them.
c54303	From there a fire will spread to the whole house of Israel.
c54304	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c54305	‘This [is] Jerusalem,
c54306	which I have set in the center of the nations,
c54307	with countries all around her.
c54308	But she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the nations,
c54309	and against My statutes worse than the countries
c54310	around her.
c54311	For her people have rejected My ordinances
c54312	My statutes.’
c54313	and have not walked in
c54314	Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says:
c54315	‘You have been more insubordinate than the nations
c54316	around you;
c54317	you have not walked in My statutes
c54318	or kept My ordinances; nor
c54319	to the ordinances of the nations
c54320	around you.’
c54321	have you even conformed
c54322	Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says:
c54323	‘Behold, ... against you, [Jerusalem],
c54324	I Myself am
c54325	and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations.
c54326	I will do
c54327	to you what I have never done before
c54328	and will never do again.
c54329	Because of all your abominations,
c54330	As a result, fathers among you will eat their sons,
c54331	and sons will eat their fathers.
c54332	I will execute judgments
c54333	against you and scatter all your remnant to every wind.’
c54334	Therefore
c54335	as surely as I live,
c54336	declares the Lord GOD,
c54338	because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and abominations,
c54339	I Myself will withdraw My favor;
c54340	I will not look upon you with pity,
c54341	[nor] will I spare you.
c54342	A third of your people will die by plague
c54343	or be consumed by famine within you,
c54344	a third will fall by the sword outside [your walls],
c54345	and a third I will scatter to every wind
c54346	and unleash a sword behind them.
c54347	And when My anger is spent
c54348	and I have vented My wrath against them,
c54349	I will be appeased.
c54350	they will know
c54351	that I, the LORD, in My zeal have spoken.
c54352	And when I have spent My wrath on them,
c54353	I will make you a ruin and a disgrace among the nations
c54354	around you,
c54355	in the sight of all who pass by.
c54356	So you will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror to the nations
c54357	around you,
c54358	when I execute judgments against you in anger, wrath, and raging fury.
c54359	I, the LORD, have spoken.
c54360	When I shower you with the deadly arrows of famine
c54361	[and] destruction
c54362	that I will send
c54363	to destroy you,
c54364	I will intensify the famine against you
c54365	and cut off your supply of bread.
c54366	I will send famine and wild beasts against you,
c54367	and they will leave you childless.
c54368	Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you,
c54369	and I will bring a sword against you.
c54370	I, the LORD, have spoken.”
c54371	And the word of the LORD came to me,
c54372	saying,
c54373	“Son of man,
c54374	turn your face toward the mountains of Israel
c54375	and prophesy against them.
c54376	You are to say:
c54377	‘O mountains of Israel,
c54378	hear the word of the Lord GOD!
c54379	This is what the Lord GOD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys:
c54381	I am about to bring a sword against you,
c54382	and I will destroy your high places.
c54383	Your altars will be demolished
c54384	and your incense altars will be smashed;
c54385	and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
c54386	I will lay the corpses of the Israelites before their idols
c54387	and scatter your bones around your altars.
c54388	Wherever you live, the cities will be laid waste
c54389	and the high places will be demolished,
c54390	so that ... will be laid waste
c54391	your altars ... and desecrated,
c54392	smashed
c54393	your idols ... and obliterated,
c54394	your incense altars cut down,
c54395	and your works blotted out.
c54396	The slain will fall among you,
c54397	and you will know
c54398	that I am the LORD.
c54399	Yet I will leave a remnant.
c54400	For some of you will escape the sword ... among the nations
c54401	when you are scattered ... and throughout the lands.
c54402	Then in the nations ... your survivors will remember Me—
c54403	to which they have been carried captive,
c54404	how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts
c54405	that turned away from Me,
c54406	and by their eyes
c54407	that lusted after idols.
c54408	So they will loathe themselves for the evil
c54409	they have done and for all their abominations.
c54410	And they will know
c54411	that I am the LORD;
c54412	I did not declare in vain
c54413	that I would bring this calamity upon them.
c54414	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c54415	Clap your hands,
c54416	stomp your feet,
c54417	and cry
c54418	“Alas”
c54419	for all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel,
c54420	who will fall by sword, famine, and plague.
c54421	He who is far off will die by the plague,
c54422	he who is near will fall by the sword,
c54423	and he who remains will die of famine.
c54424	So I will vent My fury upon them.
c54425	Then you will know
c54426	that I am the LORD,
c54427	when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, and under every green tree [and] leafy oak—
c54428	the places
c54429	where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols.
c54430	I will stretch out My hand against them,
c54431	and wherever they live I will make the land a desolate waste, from the wilderness to Diblah.
c54432	Then they will know
c54433	that I am the LORD.’”
c54434	And the word of the LORD came to me,
c54435	saying,
c54436	“O
c54437	son of man,
c54438	this is what the Lord GOD says to the land of Israel:
c54439	‘The end!
c54440	The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
c54441	The end is now upon you,
c54442	and I will unleash My anger against you;
c54443	I will judge you according to your ways
c54444	and repay you for all your abominations.
c54445	I will not look on you with pity,
c54446	nor will I spare you,
c54447	but I will punish you for your ways
c54448	and for the abominations among you.
c54449	Then you will know
c54450	that I am the LORD.’
c54451	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c54452	‘Disaster! An unprecedented disaster—
c54453	behold, it is coming!
c54454	The end has come!
c54455	The end has come!
c54456	It has roused itself against you.
c54457	Behold, it has come!
c54458	Doom has come to you,
c54459	O inhabitants of the land.
c54460	The time has come;
c54461	the day is near;
c54462	there is panic
c54463	on the mountains instead of shouts of joy.
c54464	Very soon I will pour out My wrath upon you
c54465	and vent My anger against you;
c54466	I will judge you according to your ways
c54467	and punish you for all your abominations.
c54468	I will not look on you with pity,
c54469	nor will I spare you,
c54470	but I will punish you for your ways
c54471	and for the abominations among you.
c54472	Then you will know
c54473	that it is I, the LORD, who strikes the blow.
c54474	Behold, the day
c54475	is here! It has come!
c54476	Doom has gone out,
c54477	the rod ... has bloomed.
c54478	has budded, arrogance
c54479	Their violence has grown into a rod [to punish their] wickedness.
c54480	None of them [will remain]:
c54481	none of their multitude,
c54482	none of their wealth,
c54483	and nothing of value.
c54484	The time has come;
c54485	the day has arrived.
c54486	Let the buyer not rejoice
c54487	and the seller not mourn,
c54488	for wrath is upon all their multitudes.
c54489	The seller will surely not recover what he sold
c54490	as long as both remain alive.
c54491	For the vision concerning the whole multitude will not be revoked,
c54493	and because of their iniquity, not one ... his life.
c54494	will preserve
c54495	They have blown the trumpet
c54496	and made everything ready,
c54497	but no one goes to war,
c54498	for My wrath is upon the whole multitude.
c54499	The sword is outside;
c54500	plague and famine are within.
c54501	Those in the country
c54502	will die by the sword,
c54503	and those in the city
c54504	will be devoured by famine and plague.
c54505	The survivors will escape
c54506	and live in the mountains, ... like doves of the valley,
c54507	all moaning
c54508	each for his own iniquity.
c54509	Every hand will go limp,
c54510	and every knee will turn to water.
c54511	They will put on sackcloth,
c54512	and terror will overwhelm them.
c54513	Shame will cover all their faces,
c54514	and all their heads will be shaved.
c54515	They will throw their silver into the streets,
c54516	and their gold will seem unclean.
c54517	Their silver and gold cannot
c54518	save them in the day of the wrath of the LORD.
c54519	They cannot satisfy their appetites
c54520	or fill their stomachs with [wealth],
c54521	for it became the stumbling block that brought their iniquity.
c54522	His beautiful ornaments
c54523	they transformed into pride
c54524	and used them to fashion their vile images and detestable idols.
c54525	Therefore I will make these into something unclean for them.
c54526	And I will hand these things over as plunder to foreigners
c54527	and as loot to the wicked of the earth,
c54528	who will defile them.
c54529	I will turn My face away from them,
c54530	as they defile My treasured place.
c54531	Violent men will enter it
c54532	and they will defile it.
c54533	Forge the chain,
c54534	for the land is full of crimes of bloodshed,
c54535	and the city is full of violence.
c54536	So I will bring the most wicked of nations
c54537	to take possession of their houses.
c54538	I will end the pride of the mighty,
c54539	and their holy places will be profaned.
c54540	Anguish is coming!
c54541	They will seek peace,
c54542	but find none.
c54543	Disaster upon disaster will come,
c54544	and rumor after rumor.
c54545	Then they will seek a vision from a prophet,
c54546	but instruction from the priests ... will perish.
c54547	and counsel from the ancients
c54548	The king will mourn,
c54549	the prince will be clothed with despair,
c54550	and the hands of the people of the land will tremble.
c54551	I will deal with them according to their conduct,
c54552	and I will judge them by their own standards.
c54553	Then they will know
c54554	that I am the LORD.’”
c54555	In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day,
c54556	I was sitting in my house,
c54557	and the elders of Judah were sitting before me;
c54558	and there the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me.
c54559	Then I looked
c54560	and saw a figure like that of a man. ... was fire,
c54561	From what appeared to be His waist down
c54562	and from His waist up his appearance was as bright as the gleam of amber.
c54563	He stretched out what looked like a hand
c54564	and took me by the hair of my head.
c54565	Then the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven
c54566	and carried me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance ... gate of the inner court,
c54567	of the north
c54568	where the idol ... jealousy was located.
c54569	that provokes
c54570	And there I saw the glory of the God of Israel,
c54571	like the vision
c54572	I had seen in the plain.
c54573	He said to me,
c54574	“Son of man,”
c54575	“now lift up your eyes to the north.”
c54576	So I lifted up my eyes to the north,
c54577	and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.
c54578	He said to me,
c54579	“Son of man,”
c54580	“do you see
c54581	what they are doing—
c54582	the great abominations
c54583	that the house of Israel is committing—
c54584	to drive Me far from My sanctuary?
c54585	Yet
c54586	you will see even greater abominations.”
c54587	Then He brought me to the entrance of the court,
c54588	and I looked
c54589	and saw a hole in the wall.
c54590	He told me,
c54591	“Son of man,”
c54592	“dig through the wall.”
c54593	So I dug through the wall
c54594	and discovered a doorway.
c54595	Then He said to me,
c54596	“Go in
c54597	and see the wicked abominations
c54598	they are committing here.”
c54599	So I went in
c54600	and looked,
c54601	and engraved all around the wall was every kind of crawling creature and detestable beast, along with all the idols of the house of Israel.
c54602	seventy elders of the house of Israel, ... Each
c54603	stood ... with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan ... among them.
c54604	Before them ... standing
c54606	had a censer in his hand,
c54607	and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.
c54608	He said to me,
c54609	“do you see
c54610	“Son of man,”
c54611	what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness,
c54612	each at the shrine of his own idol?
c54613	For they are saying,
c54614	‘The LORD does not see us;
c54615	the LORD has forsaken the land.’”
c54616	He told me,
c54617	Again,
c54618	“You will see ... even greater abominations.”
c54619	them committing
c54620	Then He brought me to the entrance ... gate of the house of the LORD,
c54621	of the north
c54622	and I saw women sitting there,
c54623	weeping for Tammuz.
c54624	And He said to me,
c54625	“Do you see
c54626	this, son of man?
c54628	You will see even greater abominations than these.”
c54629	So He brought me to the inner court of the house of the LORD,
c54630	and there at the entrance to the temple of the LORD, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men
c54631	with their backs to the temple of the LORD
c54632	and their faces toward the east;
c54633	and they were bowing to the east in worship of the sun.
c54634	And He said to me,
c54635	“Do you see this,
c54636	son of man?
c54637	Is it not enough for the house of Judah
c54638	to commit the abominations
c54639	they are practicing here,
c54640	that they must also fill the land with violence
c54641	and continually
c54642	provoke Me to anger?
c54643	Look, they are even putting the branch to their nose!
c54644	Therefore I will respond with wrath.
c54645	I will not look on them with pity
c54646	or spare them. ... I will not
c54647	Although they shout loudly in My ears,
c54648	listen to them.”
c54649	Then I heard Him call out in a loud voice,
c54650	saying,
c54651	“Draw near,
c54652	O executioners of the city,
c54653	each
c54654	[with] a weapon of destruction in his hand.”
c54655	And I saw
c54656	six men coming from the direction of the Upper Gate,
c54657	which faces north,
c54658	each
c54659	with a weapon of slaughter in his hand.
c54660	With them was another man clothed in linen
c54661	who had a writing kit at his side.
c54662	And they came in
c54663	and stood beside the bronze altar.
c54664	Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherubim,
c54665	where it had been, [and moved]
c54666	to the threshold of the temple.
c54667	And He called to the man
c54668	clothed in linen
c54669	who had the writing kit at his side.
c54670	said the LORD,
c54671	“Go throughout the city of Jerusalem,”
c54672	“and put a mark on the foreheads of the men
c54673	sighing
c54674	and groaning over all the abominations
c54675	committed there.”
c54676	And as I listened, He said to the others,
c54677	“Follow him through the city
c54678	and start killing;
c54679	do not show pity
c54680	or spare anyone!
c54681	Slaughter the old men, the young men and maidens, the women and children,
c54682	anyone
c54683	who has the mark.
c54684	but do not go near
c54685	Now begin at My sanctuary.”
c54686	So they began with the elders
c54687	who [were] before the temple.
c54688	Then He told them,
c54689	“Defile the temple
c54690	and fill the courts with the slain.
c54691	Go forth!”
c54692	So they went out
c54693	and began killing throughout the city.
c54695	While they were killing,
c54696	I was left alone.
c54697	And I fell facedown
c54698	and cried out,
c54700	“Oh, Lord GOD,
c54701	will You destroy the entire remnant of Israel?”
c54702	when You pour out Your wrath on Jerusalem,
c54703	And He said to me,
c54704	“The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah [is] exceedingly great.
c54705	The land is full of bloodshed,
c54706	and the city full of perversity.
c54707	For they say,
c54708	‘The LORD has forsaken the land;
c54709	the LORD does not see.’
c54710	But as for Me, I
c54711	will not show pity
c54712	or spare them.
c54713	I will bring their deeds down upon their own heads.”
c54714	Then
c54715	the man clothed in linen
c54716	with the writing kit at his side
c54717	reported back,
c54719	“I have done as
c54720	You commanded.”
c54721	And I looked
c54722	and saw
c54723	above the expanse,
c54724	above the heads of the cherubim,
c54725	the likeness of a throne of sapphire.
c54726	And the LORD said to the man clothed in linen,
c54728	“Go inside the wheelwork beneath the cherubim. ... from among
c54729	Fill your hands with burning coals ... the cherubim
c54730	and scatter them over the city.”
c54731	And as I watched, he went in.
c54732	the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple,
c54733	Now when the man went in,
c54734	and a cloud filled the inner court.
c54735	Then the glory of the LORD rose from above the cherubim [and stood] over the threshold of the temple.
c54736	The temple was filled with the cloud,
c54737	and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD.
c54738	The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty
c54739	when He speaks.
c54740	When
c54741	the LORD commanded the man clothed in linen,
c54742	saying,
c54743	“Take fire from within the wheelwork, from among the cherubim,”
c54744	the man went in
c54745	and stood beside a wheel.
c54746	Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand ... the fire ... was among them,
c54747	that
c54748	and took [some of]
c54749	and he put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen,
c54750	who received it
c54751	and left.
c54752	(The cherubim appeared to have the form of human hands under their wings.)
c54753	Then I looked
c54754	and saw
c54755	four wheels beside the cherubim,
c54756	one wheel beside each cherub.
c54757	the wheels
c54758	[And] ... gleamed like a beryl stone.
c54759	[As for] their appearance,
c54760	all four had the same form,
c54761	like a wheel within a wheel.
c54762	When they moved,
c54763	they would go in any of the four directions,
c54764	without turning
c54765	as they moved.
c54766	But wherever
c54767	the head faced,
c54768	they would go in that direction,
c54769	without turning
c54770	as they went.
c54771	Their entire bodies, including their backs, hands, and wings, were full of eyes all around,
c54772	as were their four wheels.
c54773	the wheels
c54774	I heard ... being called “the whirling wheels.”
c54775	Each [of the cherubim] had four faces:
c54776	the first face was that of a cherub,
c54777	the second that of a man, ... that
c54778	the third ... of a lion, ... that
c54779	and the fourth ... of an eagle.
c54780	Then the cherubim rose upward.
c54781	These were the living creatures
c54782	I had seen by the River Kebar.
c54784	When the cherubim moved,
c54785	the wheels moved beside them,
c54787	[and even when they] spread their wings
c54788	to rise from the ground,
c54789	the wheels did not veer away from their side.
c54790	When the cherubim stood still,
c54791	the wheels also stood still,
c54793	and when they ascended,
c54794	the wheels ascended with them,
c54795	for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
c54796	Then the glory of the LORD moved away from over the threshold of the temple
c54797	and stood above the cherubim.
c54798	the cherubim lifted their wings
c54799	As I watched, ... and rose up from the ground,
c54800	them as they went.
c54801	with the wheels beside
c54802	And they stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD,
c54803	with the glory of the God of Israel above them.
c54804	These were the living creatures
c54805	I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the River Kebar,
c54806	and I knew
c54807	that they were cherubim.
c54808	Each had four faces ... four
c54809	and ... wings,
c54810	with what looked like human hands under their wings.
c54811	Their faces looked like
c54812	the faces
c54813	I had seen by the River Kebar.
c54814	Each ... straight ahead.
c54815	creature went
c54816	Then the Spirit lifted me up
c54817	and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD
c54818	that faces east.
c54819	And there
c54820	at the entrance of the gate [were] twenty-five men.
c54821	Among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, who were leaders of the people.
c54822	And [the LORD] said to me,
c54823	“Son of man,
c54824	these are the men
c54825	who plot evil
c54826	and give wicked counsel in this city.
c54827	They are saying,
c54828	‘Is not the time near
c54829	to build houses?
c54830	The city is a cooking pot,
c54831	and we are the meat.’
c54832	Therefore
c54833	prophesy against them;
c54834	prophesy,
c54835	O son of man!”
c54836	And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me
c54837	and told me
c54838	to declare
c54839	that this is what the LORD says:
c54840	“That is what you are thinking,
c54841	O house of Israel;
c54842	and I know the thoughts that arise in your minds.
c54843	You have multiplied those you killed in this city
c54844	and filled its streets with the dead.
c54845	Therefore
c54846	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c54847	The slain
c54848	you have laid within
c54849	[this city] are the meat,
c54850	and the city is the pot;
c54851	but I will remove you from it.
c54852	You fear the sword,
c54853	so I will bring the sword against you,
c54854	declares the Lord GOD.
c54855	I will bring you out of [the city]
c54856	and hand you over to foreigners;
c54857	I will execute judgments against you.
c54858	You will fall by the sword,
c54859	and I will judge you to the border of Israel.
c54860	Then you will know
c54861	that I am the LORD.
c54862	The city will not be a pot for you,
c54863	nor will you be the meat within it.
c54864	I will judge you even to the borders of Israel.
c54865	Then you will know
c54866	that I am the LORD.
c54867	For you have neither followed My statutes
c54868	nor practiced my ordinances,
c54869	to the ordinances of the nations
c54870	around you.”
c54871	but you have conformed
c54872	Now as I was
c54873	prophesying,
c54874	Pelatiah son of Benaiah died.
c54875	Then I fell facedown
c54876	and cried out in a loud voice,
c54878	“Oh, Lord GOD,
c54879	will You bring the remnant of Israel to a complete end?”
c54880	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c54881	saying,
c54882	“Son of man,
c54883	your brothers— your relatives, your fellow exiles, and the whole house of Israel—
c54884	are those of whom the people of Jerusalem have said,
c54885	‘They are far from the LORD;
c54887	this land has been given us as a possession.’
c54888	Therefore
c54889	declare
c54890	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c54891	‘Although I sent them far away among the nations
c54892	and scattered them among the countries,
c54893	yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries
c54894	to which they have gone.’
c54895	Therefore
c54896	declare
c54897	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c54898	‘I will gather you from the peoples
c54899	and assemble you from the countries
c54900	to which you have been scattered,
c54901	and I will give you [back] the land of Israel.’
c54902	‘When they return to it,
c54903	they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.
c54904	And I will give them singleness of heart
c54905	and put a new spirit within them;
c54906	I will remove their heart of stone
c54907	and give them a heart of flesh,
c54908	so that they may follow My statutes,
c54909	keep My ordinances,
c54910	and practice them.
c54911	Then they will be My people,
c54912	and I will be their God.
c54913	But as for those whose hearts pursue detestable things and abominations,
c54914	I will bring their conduct down upon their own heads,
c54915	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c54916	Then the cherubim, ... spread their wings,
c54917	with the wheels beside them,
c54918	and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
c54919	And the glory of the LORD rose up from within the city
c54920	and stood over the mountain
c54921	east of the city.
c54922	The Spirit lifted me up
c54923	and carried me back to Chaldea, to the exiles in the vision [given] by the Spirit of God.
c54924	After the vision ... had gone up from me,
c54925	I had seen
c54926	I told the exiles everything the LORD
c54927	had shown me.
c54928	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c54929	saying,
c54930	“Son of man,
c54931	you are living in a rebellious house.
c54932	They have eyes
c54933	to see
c54934	but do not see,
c54935	and ears
c54936	to hear
c54937	but do not hear,
c54938	for they are a rebellious house.
c54939	Therefore,
c54940	son of man,
c54941	pack your bags for exile.
c54942	In broad daylight,
c54943	set out and go from your place to another as they look on.
c54944	Perhaps they will understand,
c54945	though they are a rebellious house.
c54946	Bring out your baggage for exile by day, as they look on.
c54947	Then in the evening, as they look on, go out like those who go into exile.
c54948	While they watch, dig through the wall
c54949	and carry [your belongings] out through it.
c54950	And as they look on, lift your bags to your shoulder
c54951	and take them out at dusk;
c54952	cover your face
c54953	so that you cannot see the land.
c54954	For I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.”
c54955	So I did
c54956	as I was commanded.
c54957	I brought out my bags for exile by day,
c54958	and in the evening I dug through the wall by hand.
c54959	I took [my belongings] out at dusk,
c54960	carrying them on my shoulder as they watched.
c54961	And in the morning the word of the LORD came to me,
c54962	saying,
c54963	“Son of man,
c54964	hasn’t the rebellious house of Israel asked you,
c54965	‘What are you doing?’
c54966	Tell them
c54967	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c54968	‘This oracle [concerns] the prince in Jerusalem
c54969	and all the house of Israel
c54970	who are there.’
c54971	You are to say,
c54972	‘I am a sign for you.
c54973	Just as I have done,
c54974	so will it be done to them;
c54975	they will go into exile as captives.’
c54976	the prince
c54977	among them
c54978	And at dusk ... will lift his bags to his shoulder
c54979	and go out.
c54980	They will dig through the wall
c54981	to bring him out.
c54982	He will cover his face
c54983	so he cannot see the land.
c54984	But I will spread My net over him,
c54985	and he will be caught in My snare.
c54986	I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans;
c54987	yet he will not see it,
c54988	and there he will die.
c54989	all
c54990	around him
c54991	I will also scatter to the winds ... the attendants ... and all his troops,
c54992	and I will draw a sword to chase after them.
c54993	And they will know
c54994	that I am the LORD
c54995	when I disperse them among the nations
c54996	and scatter them throughout the countries.
c54997	But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine, and plague,
c54998	so that they can tell of all their abominations among the nations
c54999	to which they go.
c55000	Then they will know
c55001	that I am the LORD.”
c55002	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me,
c55003	saying,
c55004	“Son of man,
c55005	eat your bread with trembling,
c55006	and drink your water with quivering and anxiety.
c55007	Then tell the people ... the land
c55008	of the land that this is what the Lord GOD says about those living in Jerusalem [and] in ... of Israel:
c55009	‘They will eat their bread with anxiety
c55010	and drink their water in dread,
c55011	for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all
c55012	those who dwell in it.
c55013	cities
c55014	The inhabited
c55015	will be laid waste,
c55016	and the land will become desolate.
c55017	Then you will know
c55018	that I am the LORD.’”
c55019	Again the word of the LORD came to me,
c55020	saying,
c55021	“Son of man,
c55022	what is this proverb [that] you have in the land of Israel:
c55024	‘The days go by,
c55025	and every vision fails’?
c55026	Therefore
c55027	tell them
c55028	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55029	‘I will put an end to this proverb,
c55030	and in Israel they will no longer recite it.’
c55031	But say to them:
c55032	‘The days are at hand
c55033	when every vision will be fulfilled.
c55034	For there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations within the house of Israel,
c55035	because I, the LORD,
c55036	will speak
c55037	whatever ... I speak,
c55038	word
c55039	and it will be fulfilled
c55040	without delay.
c55041	For in your days,
c55042	O rebellious house,
c55043	I will speak a message
c55044	and bring it to pass,
c55045	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c55046	Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me,
c55047	saying,
c55048	“Son of man,
c55049	take note
c55050	that the house of Israel is saying,
c55051	‘The vision
c55052	that he sees
c55053	is for many years from now;
c55054	he prophesies about the distant future.’
c55055	Therefore
c55056	tell them
c55057	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55058	‘None of My words will be delayed any longer.
c55059	The message I speak
c55060	will be fulfilled,
c55061	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c55062	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c55063	saying,
c55064	“Son of man,
c55065	prophesy against the prophets of Israel
c55066	who are now prophesying.
c55067	Tell those who prophesy out of their own imagination:
c55068	‘Hear the word of the LORD!
c55069	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c55070	Woe to the foolish prophets
c55071	who follow their own spirit,
c55072	yet have seen nothing.
c55073	Your prophets, ... like jackals among the ruins.
c55074	O Israel,
c55075	are
c55076	You did not go up to the gaps
c55077	or restore the wall around the house of Israel
c55078	so that it would stand in the battle on the Day of the LORD.
c55079	They see false visions and speak lying divinations.
c55080	They claim,
c55081	“Thus declares the LORD,”
c55082	when the LORD did not send them;
c55083	yet they wait
c55084	for the fulfillment of their message.
c55085	Have you not seen a false vision
c55086	a lying divination when you proclaimed,
c55087	and spoken
c55088	“Thus declares the LORD,”
c55089	even though I had not spoken?’
c55090	Therefore
c55091	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55092	‘Because you have uttered vain words
c55093	and seen false visions,
c55094	I am against you,
c55095	declares the Lord GOD.
c55096	My hand will be against the prophets
c55097	who see false visions
c55098	and speak lying divinations.
c55099	They will not belong to the council of My people
c55100	or be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they
c55101	enter the land of Israel.
c55102	Then you will know
c55103	that I am the Lord GOD.
c55104	Because
c55105	they have led My people astray,
c55106	saying,
c55107	“Peace,”
c55108	when there is no peace,
c55109	any flimsy wall that is built,
c55110	and whitewashing
c55111	tell
c55112	those whitewashing it
c55113	that it will fall.
c55114	Rain will come in torrents,
c55116	I will send hailstones
c55117	plunging down,
c55118	and a windstorm will burst forth.
c55119	Surely when the wall has fallen,
c55120	you will not be asked,
c55121	“Where is the whitewash
c55122	with which you covered it?”’
c55123	Therefore
c55124	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55125	‘In My wrath I will release a windstorm,
c55126	and in My anger torrents of rain ... will fall
c55127	and hail ... with destructive fury.
c55128	I will tear down the wall
c55129	you whitewashed
c55130	and level it to the ground,
c55131	so that its foundation is exposed.
c55132	The city will fall,
c55133	and you will be destroyed within it.
c55134	Then you will know
c55135	that I am the LORD.
c55136	And after I have vented My wrath against the wall
c55137	and against those who have whitewashed it,
c55138	I will say to you:
c55139	“The wall is no more
c55140	and neither
c55141	are those who whitewashed it—
c55142	those prophets of Israel
c55143	who prophesied to Jerusalem
c55144	and saw a vision of peace for her
c55145	when there was no peace,
c55146	declares the Lord GOD.”’
c55147	Now,
c55148	O son of man,
c55149	set your face against the daughters of your people
c55150	who prophesy out of their own imagination.
c55151	Prophesy against them
c55152	and tell them that
c55153	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55154	‘Woe
c55155	to the women who sew magic charms on their wrists
c55156	and make veils for the heads of people of every height,
c55157	in order to ensnare their souls.
c55158	Will you ensnare the souls of My people
c55159	but preserve your own?
c55160	You have profaned Me among My people for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread.
c55161	you have killed those
c55162	who should not have died
c55163	and spared those
c55164	who should not have lived.’
c55165	By lying to My people
c55166	who would listen,
c55167	Therefore,
c55168	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55169	‘See, I am against the magic charms
c55170	with which you ensnare souls like birds,
c55171	and I will tear them from your arms.
c55172	I will free the souls
c55173	you have ensnared.
c55174	I will also tear off your veils
c55175	and deliver My people from your hands,
c55176	so that they will no longer be prey in your hands.
c55177	Then you will know
c55178	that I am the LORD.
c55179	Because you have disheartened the righteous with your lies,
c55180	even though I have caused them no grief,
c55181	and because you have encouraged ... from their evil
c55182	the wicked not to turn ... ways
c55183	to save their lives,
c55184	therefore you will no ... see false visions
c55185	longer ... or practice divination.
c55186	I will deliver My people from your hands.
c55187	Then you will know
c55188	that I am the LORD.’”
c55189	Then some of the elders of Israel came
c55190	and sat down before me.
c55191	And the word of the LORD came to me,
c55192	saying,
c55193	“Son of man,
c55194	these men have set up idols in their hearts
c55195	and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces.
c55196	Should I consult with them in any way?
c55197	Therefore, speak to them
c55198	and tell them ... in
c55199	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55200	any Israelite
c55201	‘When ... sets up idols ... his heart ... to
c55202	and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face,
c55203	and then comes ... the prophet,
c55204	I the LORD will answer him
c55206	according to his great idolatry,
c55207	so that I may take hold of the hearts of the [people] of Israel.
c55208	For because of their idols, they are all estranged from Me.’
c55209	Therefore tell the house of Israel
c55210	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55211	‘Repent
c55212	and turn away from your idols;
c55213	turn your faces away from all your abominations.
c55214	For when any Israelite or any foreigner
c55215	dwelling in Israel
c55216	separates himself from Me,
c55217	sets up idols in his heart,
c55218	and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face,
c55219	and then comes to the prophet
c55220	to inquire of Me,
c55221	I the LORD will answer him Myself.
c55222	I will set My face against that man
c55223	and make him a sign and a proverb;
c55224	I will cut him off from among My people.
c55225	Then you will know
c55226	that I am the LORD.
c55227	the prophet
c55228	But if ... is enticed
c55229	to speak a message,
c55230	then it was I the LORD who enticed him,
c55231	and I will stretch out My hand against him
c55232	and destroy him from among My people Israel.
c55233	They will bear their punishment—
c55234	the punishment of the inquirer will be the same as that of the prophet—
c55235	in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me
c55236	and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions.
c55237	Then they will be My people
c55238	and I will be their God,
c55239	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c55240	And the word of the LORD came to me,
c55241	saying,
c55242	“Son of man,
c55243	a land
c55244	if ... sins against Me
c55245	by acting unfaithfully,
c55246	and I stretch out My hand against it
c55247	to cut off its supply of bread,
c55248	to send famine through it,
c55249	and to cut off from it both man and beast,
c55250	then even if these three men— Noah, Daniel, and Job— were in it,
c55251	their righteousness could deliver only themselves,
c55252	declares the Lord GOD.
c55253	Or if I send wild beasts through the land
c55254	and they bereave it
c55255	so that it becomes desolate,
c55256	with no man passing through for fear of the beasts,
c55257	even if these three men were in it,
c55258	then as surely as I live,
c55259	declares the Lord GOD,
c55260	they could not ... their own sons
c55261	deliver ... or daughters.
c55262	They alone would be saved,
c55263	but the land would be desolate.
c55264	Or if I bring a sword against that land
c55265	and say,
c55266	‘Let a sword pass through it,’
c55267	so that I cut off from it both man and beast,
c55268	even if these three men were in it,
c55269	then as surely as I live,
c55270	declares the Lord GOD,
c55271	they could not deliver their sons or daughters;
c55272	they alone would be saved.
c55273	Or if I send a plague into that land
c55274	and pour out My wrath upon it through bloodshed,
c55275	cutting off from it both man and beast,
c55276	even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it,
c55277	then as surely as I live,
c55278	declares the Lord GOD,
c55279	neither son
c55280	they could deliver ... nor daughter.
c55281	Their righteousness could save only themselves.
c55282	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55283	‘How much worse
c55284	will it be when I send against Jerusalem My four dire judgments— sword, famine, wild beasts, and plague—
c55285	in order to cut off from it both man and beast?
c55286	Yet , behold, some survivors will be left in it—
c55287	who will be brought out.
c55288	sons and daughters
c55289	They will come out to you,
c55290	and when you see their conduct and actions,
c55291	you will be consoled regarding the disaster
c55292	I have brought upon Jerusalem— everything
c55293	that I have brought upon it.
c55294	They will bring you consolation
c55295	when you see their conduct and actions,
c55296	and you will know
c55297	that it was not without cause that I have done all
c55298	[these things] within it,
c55299	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c55300	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c55301	saying,
c55302	“Son of man,
c55303	how does the wood of the vine surpass any [other] branch
c55304	among the trees in the forest?
c55305	Can wood be taken from it
c55306	to make something useful?
c55307	Or ... make from it a peg
c55308	can one ... on which to hang utensils?
c55309	No, it is cast into the fire for fuel.
c55310	The fire devours both ends,
c55311	and the middle is charred.
c55312	Can it be useful for anything?
c55313	Even
c55314	when it was whole,
c55315	it could not be made useful.
c55316	How much less
c55317	when the fire has consumed
c55318	and charred it!
c55319	can it ever be useful
c55320	Therefore,
c55321	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55322	‘Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest,
c55323	which I have given to the fire for fuel,
c55324	so I will give up the people of Jerusalem.
c55325	And I will set My face against them.
c55326	Though they may have escaped the fire,
c55327	yet another fire will consume them.
c55328	you will know
c55329	that I [am] the LORD.
c55330	And when I set My face against them,
c55331	Thus I will make the land desolate,
c55332	because they have acted unfaithfully,
c55333	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c55334	Again the word of the LORD came to me,
c55335	saying,
c55336	“Son of man,
c55337	confront Jerusalem with her abominations
c55338	and tell [her]
c55339	this is what the Lord GOD says to Jerusalem:
c55340	‘Your origin and your birth were in the land of the Canaanites.
c55341	Your father was an Amorite
c55342	and your mother a Hittite.
c55343	of your birth
c55344	On the day
c55346	your cord was not cut,
c55347	nor were you washed with water for cleansing.
c55348	You were not rubbed with salt
c55349	or wrapped in cloths.
c55350	No one cared enough for you
c55351	to do even one of these things
c55352	out of compassion for you.
c55353	Instead, you were thrown out into the open field, because you were despised on the day
c55354	of your birth.
c55355	Then I passed by
c55356	you and saw
c55357	you squirming in your blood,
c55358	I said to you,
c55359	and as you lay there in your blood ... “Live!”
c55360	I said to you,
c55361	[There] ... “Live!”
c55362	I made you thrive like a plant of the field.
c55363	You grew up
c55364	and matured
c55365	and became very beautiful.
c55366	Your breasts were formed
c55367	and your hair grew,
c55368	but you were naked and bare.
c55369	Then I passed by
c55370	you and saw you,
c55371	and you were indeed old enough for love.
c55372	So I spread My cloak over you
c55373	and covered your nakedness.
c55374	I pledged Myself to you,
c55375	entered into a covenant with you,
c55376	declares the Lord GOD.
c55377	and you became Mine,
c55378	Then I bathed you with water,
c55379	rinsed off your blood,
c55380	and anointed you with oil.
c55381	I clothed you in embroidered cloth
c55382	and provided you sandals of fine leather.
c55383	I wrapped you in fine linen
c55384	and covered you with silk.
c55385	I adorned you with jewelry,
c55386	and I put bracelets on your wrists
c55387	and a chain around your neck.
c55388	I put a ring in your nose,
c55389	earrings on your ears,
c55390	and a beautiful crown upon your head.
c55391	So you were adorned with gold and silver,
c55392	and your clothes were of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth.
c55393	You ate fine flour, honey, and oil.
c55394	You became very beautiful
c55395	and rose to be a queen.
c55396	Your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty,
c55397	for it [was] perfect in the splendor
c55398	I bestowed on you,
c55399	declares the Lord GOD.
c55400	you trusted in your beauty
c55401	But because of your fame, ... and played the harlot.
c55402	You lavished your favors on everyone who passed by,
c55403	and your beauty was theirs for the asking.
c55404	You took some of your garments
c55405	and made colorful high places for yourself,
c55406	and on them you prostituted yourself.
c55407	Such things should not have happened;
c55408	never should they have occurred!
c55409	You also took the fine jewelry of gold and silver
c55410	I had given you,
c55411	and you made male idols
c55412	with which to prostitute yourself.
c55413	You took your embroidered garments
c55414	to cover them,
c55415	and you set My oil and incense before them.
c55416	the food
c55417	And you set
c55418	the fine flour, oil, and honey that I had fed you.
c55419	before them as a pleasing aroma ... I had given you—
c55420	That is what happened,
c55421	declares the Lord GOD.
c55422	You even took the sons and daughters
c55423	you bore to Me
c55424	and sacrificed them
c55425	as food to idols.
c55426	Was your prostitution not enough?
c55427	You slaughtered My children
c55428	and delivered them up
c55429	through the fire to idols.
c55430	And in all your abominations and acts of prostitution, you did not remember the days of your youth
c55431	when you were naked and bare,
c55432	wallowing in your own blood.
c55433	And after all your other wickedness,
c55434	Woe! Woe to you,
c55435	declares the Lord GOD.
c55436	you built yourself a mound
c55437	and made yourself a lofty shrine in every public square.
c55438	At the head of every street you built your lofty shrines
c55439	and degraded your beauty.
c55440	you spread your legs to all who passed by.
c55441	With increasing promiscuity,
c55442	You prostituted yourself with your lustful neighbors, the Egyptians,
c55443	and increased your promiscuity
c55444	to provoke Me to anger.
c55445	Therefore I stretched out My hand against you
c55446	and reduced your portion.
c55447	I gave you over to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines,
c55448	who were ashamed of your lewd conduct.
c55449	Then you prostituted yourself with the Assyrians because you were not ... satisfied.
c55450	Even after [that],
c55451	satisfied. ... you were still not
c55452	So you extended your promiscuity to Chaldea, the land of merchants—
c55453	but even with this you were not satisfied!
c55454	How weak-willed is your heart,
c55455	declares the Lord GOD,
c55456	while you do all these things,
c55457	the acts of a shameless prostitute!
c55458	But when you built your shrines at the head of every street
c55459	and made your lofty shrines in every public square,
c55460	you were not even like a prostitute,
c55461	because you scorned payment.
c55463	You adulterous wife!
c55464	You receive strangers instead of your own husband!
c55465	Men give gifts to all [their] prostitutes,
c55466	but you gave gifts to all your lovers.
c55467	You bribed them
c55468	to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors.
c55469	So your prostitution is the opposite of that of other women:
c55470	No one solicited your favors,
c55471	and you paid a fee
c55472	instead of receiving one; so you
c55473	are the very opposite.’
c55474	Therefore,
c55475	O prostitute,
c55476	hear the word of the LORD!
c55477	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c55478	‘Because you poured out your wealth
c55479	and exposed your nakedness in your promiscuity with your lovers and with all your detestable idols,
c55480	and because of the blood of your children
c55481	which you gave to them,
c55482	therefore I will surely gather all the lovers
c55483	with whom you found pleasure, ... those ... and
c55484	all
c55485	you loved ... those
c55486	all
c55487	you hated.
c55488	I will gather them against you from all around
c55489	and expose [you] before them,
c55490	and they will see all your nakedness.
c55491	And I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and those who shed blood;
c55492	so I will bring upon you the wrath of your bloodshed and jealousy.
c55493	Then I will hand you over to [your lovers],
c55494	and they will level your mounds
c55495	and tear down your lofty shrines.
c55496	They will strip off your clothes,
c55497	take your fine jewelry,
c55498	and leave you naked and bare.
c55499	They will bring a mob against
c55500	you to stone you
c55501	and cut you to pieces with their swords.
c55502	Then they will burn down your houses
c55503	and execute judgment against you in the sight of many women.
c55504	I will put an end to your prostitution,
c55505	and you will never again pay your lovers.
c55506	So I will lay to rest My wrath against you,
c55507	and My jealousy will turn away from you.
c55508	Then I will be calm
c55509	and no longer angry.
c55510	Because you did not remember the days of your youth,
c55511	but enraged Me with all these
c55512	things, I will surely
c55513	bring your deeds down upon your own head,
c55514	declares the Lord GOD.
c55515	Have you not committed this lewdness on top of all your [other] abominations?
c55516	Behold, everyone who quotes proverbs will recite this proverb about you:
c55518	“Like mother, like daughter.”
c55519	You are the daughter of your mother,
c55520	who despised her husband and children.
c55521	You are the sister of your sisters,
c55522	who despised their husbands and children.
c55523	Your mother was a Hittite
c55524	and your father an Amorite.
c55525	Your older sister was Samaria, who ... with her daughters
c55526	lived ... to your north;
c55527	sister
c55528	and your younger
c55529	who lived ... to your south.
c55530	was Sodom, ... with her daughters
c55531	You not only walked ... ways
c55532	and practiced their abominations,
c55533	but soon you were
c55534	in their ... more depraved than they were.
c55535	As surely as I live,
c55536	declares the Lord GOD,
c55537	your sister Sodom and her daughters never did
c55538	as you and your daughters have done.
c55539	Now this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom:
c55540	She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed, and complacent;
c55541	they did not help the poor and needy.
c55542	Thus they were haughty
c55543	and committed abominations before Me,
c55544	I removed them.
c55545	and when I saw this,
c55546	But Samaria did not commit half the sins you did.
c55547	You have multiplied your abominations beyond theirs,
c55548	and all the abominations ... have made your sisters appear righteous.
c55549	you have committed
c55550	So now you must bear your disgrace,
c55551	since you have brought justification for your sisters. ... because your sins
c55552	were more vile than theirs.
c55553	For they appear more righteous than you,
c55554	So you too ... your shame
c55555	must bear ... and disgrace,
c55556	since you have made your sisters appear righteous.
c55557	But I will restore Sodom and her daughters from captivity, as well as Samaria and her daughters.
c55558	And I will restore you along with them.
c55559	So you will bear your disgrace
c55560	and be ashamed of all
c55561	you did
c55562	to comfort them.
c55563	And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters ... will return to their former state.
c55564	and Samaria with her daughters, ... will also return to your former state.
c55565	You and your daughters
c55566	Did you not treat your sister Sodom as an object of scorn in the day of your pride,
c55567	before your wickedness was uncovered? Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom and all those around her, and by the daughters of the Philistines—
c55568	all those around you who despise you.
c55569	of your lewdness and your abominations,
c55570	You will bear the consequence
c55571	declares the LORD.’
c55572	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55573	‘I will deal with you
c55574	according to your deeds,
c55575	since you have despised the oath
c55576	by breaking the covenant.
c55577	But I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth,
c55578	and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
c55579	Then you will remember your ways
c55580	and be ashamed
c55581	when you receive your older and younger sisters.
c55582	I will give them to you as daughters,
c55583	but not because of My covenant with you.
c55584	So I will establish My covenant with you,
c55585	and you will know
c55586	that I am the LORD,
c55587	so that ... you will remember
c55588	and be ashamed,
c55589	and never open your mouth again because of your disgrace,
c55590	when I make atonement for all
c55591	you have done,
c55592	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c55593	Now the word of the LORD came to me,
c55594	saying,
c55595	“Son of man,
c55596	pose a riddle;
c55597	speak a parable to the house of Israel
c55598	and tell them that
c55599	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55600	‘A great eagle
c55601	with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers
c55602	of many colors,
c55603	came to Lebanon
c55604	and took away the top of the cedar.
c55605	He plucked off its topmost shoot,
c55606	carried it to the land of merchants,
c55607	and planted it in a city of traders.
c55608	He took some of the seed of the land
c55609	and planted it in fertile soil;
c55610	he placed [it] by abundant waters;
c55611	he set it out like a willow.
c55612	It sprouted
c55613	and became a spreading vine, low in height
c55614	with branches turned toward him;
c55615	yet its roots remained where it stood.
c55616	So it became a vine
c55617	and yielded branches,
c55618	and sent out shoots.
c55619	But there was another great eagle with great wings and many feathers.
c55620	And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him.
c55621	It stretched out its branches to him
c55622	from its planting bed, so that he might water it.
c55623	It had been planted in good soil by abundant waters
c55624	in order to yield branches
c55625	and bear fruit
c55626	and become a splendid vine.’
c55627	So you are to tell them
c55628	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55629	‘Will it flourish?
c55630	Will it not be uprooted
c55631	and stripped of its fruit
c55632	so that it shrivels? All its foliage
c55633	will wither!
c55634	It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by its roots.
c55635	Even if transplanted,
c55636	will it flourish?
c55637	Will it not
c55638	when the east wind strikes?
c55639	completely wither
c55640	It will wither on the bed where it sprouted.’”
c55641	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c55642	saying,
c55643	“Now say to this rebellious house:
c55644	‘Do you not know
c55645	what these [things] [mean]?’
c55646	Tell [them],
c55647	‘Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem,
c55648	carried off its king and officials,
c55649	and brought them back with him to Babylon.
c55650	He took a member of the royal family
c55651	and made a covenant with him,
c55652	putting him under oath.
c55653	Then he carried away the leading men of the land,
c55654	so that the kingdom would be brought low,
c55655	unable to lift itself up,
c55656	keeping his covenant
c55657	to survive.
c55658	But this [king] rebelled against [Babylon]
c55659	by sending his envoys to Egypt
c55660	to ask for horses and a large army.
c55661	Will he flourish?
c55662	things escape?
c55663	Will the one who does such
c55664	Can he break a covenant
c55665	and yet escape?’
c55666	‘As surely as I live,’
c55667	declares the Lord GOD,
c55668	‘surely ... in the land of the king
c55669	who enthroned him,
c55670	whose oath he despised
c55671	and whose covenant he broke.
c55672	he will die in Babylon,
c55673	Pharaoh with [his] mighty army and vast horde will not help him in battle,
c55674	when ramps are built
c55675	and siege walls constructed
c55676	to destroy many lives.
c55677	He despised the oath
c55678	by breaking the covenant.
c55679	Seeing that he gave his hand in pledge
c55680	yet did all these,
c55681	he will not escape!’
c55682	Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55683	‘As ... I live,
c55684	surely as ... My oath
c55685	that he despised
c55686	and My covenant
c55687	that he broke.
c55688	I will bring down upon his head
c55689	I will spread My net over him
c55690	and catch him in My snare.
c55691	I will bring him to Babylon
c55692	and execute judgment upon him there ... he committed
c55693	for the treason ... against Me.
c55694	All his fleeing troops will fall by the sword,
c55695	and those who survive will be scattered to every wind.
c55696	Then you will know
c55697	that I, the LORD, have spoken.’
c55698	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c55699	‘I will take a shoot from the lofty top of the cedar,
c55700	and I will set [it] out.
c55701	I will pluck a tender sprig from its topmost shoots,
c55702	and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
c55703	I will plant it on the mountain heights of Israel
c55704	so that it will bear branches;
c55705	it will yield fruit
c55706	and become a majestic cedar.
c55707	Birds of every kind will nest under it,
c55708	taking shelter in the shade of its branches.
c55709	Then all the trees of the field will know
c55710	that I am the LORD. I bring the tall tree {down},
c55711	and make the low tree tall.
c55712	I dry up the green tree
c55713	and make the withered tree flourish.
c55714	I, the LORD, have spoken,
c55715	and I will do it.’”
c55716	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c55717	saying,
c55718	“What
c55719	do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel:
c55721	‘The fathers eat sour grapes,
c55722	but the children’s teeth are set on edge’?
c55723	As surely as I live,
c55724	declares the Lord GOD,
c55725	you will no longer
c55726	quote this proverb in Israel.
c55727	Behold, every soul
c55728	belongs to Me;
c55729	both father [and] son are Mine.
c55730	The soul
c55731	who sins
c55732	is the one who will die.
c55733	a man
c55734	Now suppose ... is righteous
c55735	and does what is just and right:
c55736	‘He does not eat at the mountain
c55737	or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not
c55738	defile his neighbor’s wife
c55739	or approach a woman during her period.
c55740	He does not oppress another,
c55741	but returns his pledge to the debtor.
c55742	He does not commit robbery,
c55743	but gives his bread to the hungry
c55744	and covers the naked with clothing.
c55745	He does not engage in usury
c55746	[or] take excess interest,
c55747	but he keeps his hand from iniquity
c55748	[and] executes true justice between men.
c55749	He follows My statutes
c55750	keeps My ordinances;
c55751	and faithfully
c55752	he is righteous;
c55753	surely he will live,’
c55754	declares the Lord GOD.
c55755	Now suppose [that man] has a violent son,
c55756	who sheds blood
c55757	or does any of these [things],
c55758	though the father has done none of them:
c55759	‘Indeed, the son eats at the mountain
c55760	and defiles his neighbor’s wife.
c55761	He oppresses the poor and needy,
c55762	he commits robbery
c55763	and does not restore a pledge.
c55764	He lifts his eyes to idols;
c55765	he commits abominations.
c55766	He engages in usury
c55767	and takes excess interest.’
c55768	Will [this son] live?
c55769	He will not!
c55770	Since he has committed all these abominations,
c55771	he will surely die;
c55772	his blood will be on his own head.
c55773	Now suppose [this son] has a son
c55774	who sees all the sins his father
c55775	has committed,
c55776	considers them,
c55777	and does not do likewise:
c55778	‘He does not eat at the mountain
c55779	or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not
c55780	defile his neighbor’s wife.
c55781	He does not oppress another,
c55782	or retain a pledge,
c55783	or commit robbery.
c55784	He gives his bread to the hungry
c55785	and covers the naked with clothing.
c55786	He withholds his hand from iniquity
c55787	and takes no interest or usury.
c55788	keeps My ordinances
c55789	and follows My statutes.’
c55790	He ... Such a man will not die for his father’s iniquity.
c55791	He will surely live.
c55792	As for his father,
c55793	because he practiced extortion,
c55794	robbed his brother,
c55796	what was wrong
c55797	and did ... among his people.
c55798	he will die for his own iniquity,
c55799	Yet you may ask,
c55800	‘Why should the son not bear the iniquity of the father?’
c55801	Since the son has done what is just and right,
c55802	carefully ... all My statutes,
c55803	observing
c55804	he will surely live.
c55805	The soul
c55806	who sins
c55807	is the one who will die.
c55808	A son will not bear the iniquity of the father,
c55809	and a father will not bear the iniquity of the son.
c55810	The righteousness of the righteous man will fall upon him,
c55811	and the wickedness of the wicked man will fall upon him.
c55812	the wicked man
c55813	But if ... turns from all the sins
c55814	he has committed,
c55815	keeps all My statutes,
c55816	and does what is just and right,
c55817	he will surely live;
c55818	he will not die.
c55819	None of the transgressions
c55820	he has committed
c55821	will be held against him.
c55822	Because of the righteousness
c55823	he has practiced,
c55824	he will live.
c55825	Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked?
c55826	declares the Lord GOD.
c55827	Would I not prefer
c55828	he turn from his ways
c55829	and live?
c55831	But when a righteous man turns from his righteousness
c55832	and practices iniquity, ... the same abominations ... None
c55833	committing ... as the wicked,
c55835	will he live?
c55836	of the righteous acts
c55837	he did
c55838	will be remembered.
c55840	Because of the unfaithfulness
c55841	and sin
c55842	he has committed,
c55843	he will die.
c55844	Yet you say,
c55845	‘The way of the Lord is not just.’
c55846	Hear now,
c55847	O house of Israel:
c55848	Is it My way that is unjust?
c55849	Is it not your ways that are unjust?
c55850	When a righteous man turns from his righteousness
c55851	and practices iniquity,
c55852	he will die for this.
c55853	because of the iniquity
c55854	he has committed.
c55855	He will die
c55857	But if a wicked man turns from the wickedness
c55858	he has committed
c55859	and does what is just and right,
c55860	he will save his life.
c55861	Because he considered
c55862	and turned from all the transgressions
c55863	he had committed,
c55864	he will surely live;
c55865	he will not die.
c55866	Yet the house of Israel says,
c55867	‘The way of the Lord is not just.’
c55868	Are My ways unjust,
c55869	O house of Israel?
c55870	Is it not your ways that are unjust?
c55871	Therefore,
c55872	each according to his ways,
c55873	I will judge you,
c55874	O house of Israel,
c55875	declares the Lord GOD.
c55876	Repent
c55877	and turn from all your transgressions,
c55878	so that your iniquity will not become your downfall.
c55879	Cast away from yourselves all the transgressions
c55880	you have committed,
c55881	and fashion for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit.
c55882	Why should you die,
c55883	O house of Israel?
c55884	For I take no pleasure in anyone’s death,
c55885	declares the Lord GOD.
c55886	So repent
c55887	and live!
c55888	As for you, take up a lament for the princes of Israel
c55889	and say:
c55890	‘What was your mother? A lioness among the lions!
c55891	She lay down among the young lions;
c55892	she reared her cubs.
c55893	She brought up one of her cubs,
c55894	and he became a young lion.
c55895	After learning
c55896	to tear [his] prey,
c55897	he devoured men.
c55898	When the nations heard of him,
c55899	he was trapped in their pit.
c55900	With hooks they led him away to the land of Egypt.
c55901	When she saw
c55902	that she had waited in vain,
c55903	that her hope was lost,
c55904	she took another of her cubs
c55905	and made him a young lion.
c55906	He prowled among the lions,
c55907	and became a young lion.
c55908	After learning
c55909	to tear [his] prey,
c55910	he devoured men.
c55911	He broke down their strongholds
c55912	and devastated their cities.
c55913	The land and all who were in it shuddered at the sound of his roaring.
c55914	Then the nations set out against him from the provinces on every side.
c55915	They spread their net over him;
c55916	he was trapped in their pit.
c55917	With hooks they caged him
c55918	and brought him to the king of Babylon.
c55919	They brought him into captivity
c55920	so that his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel.
c55921	Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,
c55922	planted by the water;
c55923	it was fruitful and full of branches because of the abundant waters.
c55924	It had strong branches, fit for a ruler's scepter.
c55925	It towered high above the thick branches,
c55926	conspicuous for its height and for its dense foliage.
c55927	But it was uprooted in fury,
c55928	cast down to the ground,
c55929	and the east wind dried up
c55930	its fruit. ... were stripped off
c55931	Its strong branches ... and they withered;
c55932	the fire consumed them.
c55933	Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
c55934	Fire has gone out from its main branch
c55935	and devoured its fruit,
c55936	and no strong branch that remains
c55937	scepter.’
c55938	is fit for a ruler's
c55939	This is a lament
c55940	and shall be used as a lament.”
c55941	In the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month,
c55942	some of the elders of Israel came
c55943	to inquire of the LORD,
c55944	and they sat down before me.
c55945	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c55946	saying,
c55947	“Son of man,
c55948	speak to the elders of Israel
c55949	and tell them
c55950	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55951	to inquire of Me?
c55952	‘Have you come
c55953	As surely as I live,
c55954	I will not be consulted by you,
c55955	declares the Lord GOD.’
c55956	Will you judge them,
c55957	will you judge [them],
c55958	son of man?
c55959	Confront them with the abominations of their fathers
c55960	and tell them
c55961	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c55962	‘On the day
c55963	I chose Israel,
c55964	I swore an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob
c55965	and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt.
c55966	With an uplifted hand
c55967	I said to them,
c55968	“I am the LORD your God.”
c55969	On that day I swore to them
c55970	to bring them out of Egypt into a land
c55971	that I had searched out for them,
c55972	a land flowing with milk and honey,
c55973	the glory of all lands.
c55974	And I said to them:
c55975	“Each of you must throw away the abominations before his eyes,
c55976	and you must not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt.
c55977	I am the LORD your God.”
c55978	But they rebelled against Me
c55979	and refused
c55980	to listen.
c55981	None of them cast away the abominations before their eyes,
c55982	and they did not forsake the idols of Egypt.
c55983	So I resolved
c55984	to pour out My wrath upon them
c55985	and vent My anger against them in the land of Egypt.
c55986	But I acted for the sake of My name,
c55987	that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations
c55988	among whom they were living, in whose
c55989	sight I had revealed Myself to [Israel]
c55990	by bringing them out of Egypt.
c55991	So I brought them out of Egypt
c55992	and led them into the wilderness.
c55993	And I gave them My statutes
c55994	and made known to them My ordinances—
c55995	for the man who does [these things]
c55996	will live by them.
c55997	I also gave them My Sabbaths
c55998	as a sign between us,
c55999	so that they would know
c56000	that I am the LORD
c56001	who sanctifies them.
c56002	Yet the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness.
c56003	They did not follow My statutes
c56004	and they rejected My ordinances—
c56005	though the man who does [these things]
c56006	will live by them—
c56007	and they utterly profaned My Sabbaths.
c56008	Then I resolved
c56009	to pour out My wrath upon them ... in the wilderness.
c56010	and put an end to them
c56011	But I acted for the sake of My name,
c56012	so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations
c56013	in whose sight I had brought them out.
c56014	Moreover, with an uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness
c56015	that I would not bring them into the land
c56016	I had given [them]—
c56017	[a land] flowing with milk and honey,
c56018	the glory of all lands—
c56019	because they kept rejecting My ordinances,
c56020	in My statutes.
c56021	and refusing to walk
c56022	profaning My Sabbaths,
c56023	For their hearts continually went after their idols.
c56024	Yet I looked on them with pity
c56025	and did not destroy them
c56026	or bring them to an end in the wilderness.
c56027	In the wilderness I said to their children:
c56028	“Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers
c56029	or keep their ordinances
c56030	or defile yourselves with their idols.
c56031	I am the LORD your God;
c56032	walk in My statutes,
c56033	keep My ordinances,
c56034	and practice them.
c56035	Keep My Sabbaths holy,
c56036	and they will be a sign between us,
c56037	so that you may know
c56038	that I am the LORD your God.”
c56039	But the children rebelled against Me.
c56040	They did not walk in My statutes
c56041	or carefully ... My ordinances—
c56042	observe
c56043	though the man who does [these things]
c56044	will live by them—
c56045	and they profaned My Sabbaths.
c56046	So I resolved
c56047	to pour out My wrath upon them
c56048	and vent My anger against them in the wilderness.
c56049	But I withheld My hand
c56050	and acted for the sake of My name,
c56051	so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations
c56052	in whose sight I had brought them out.
c56053	However, with an uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness
c56054	that I would scatter them among the nations
c56055	and disperse them throughout the lands.
c56056	For they did not practice My ordinances,
c56057	but they rejected My statutes
c56058	and profaned My Sabbaths,
c56059	fixing their eyes on the idols of their fathers.
c56060	I also gave them over to statutes
c56061	that were not good
c56062	and ordinances
c56063	by which they could not live.
c56064	And I pronounced them unclean through their gifts—
c56065	the sacrifice of every firstborn {in the fire}—
c56066	so that I might devastate them,
c56067	in order that they would know
c56068	that I am the LORD.’
c56069	Therefore,
c56070	speak to the house of Israel,
c56071	son of man,
c56072	and tell them that
c56073	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56074	‘In this way also your fathers blasphemed Me
c56075	by their unfaithfulness against Me.
c56076	When I brought them into the land
c56077	that I swore
c56078	to give them
c56079	and they saw any high hill or leafy tree,
c56080	there they offered their sacrifices,
c56081	presented offerings that provoked Me,
c56082	sent up their fragrant incense,
c56083	and poured out their drink offerings.
c56084	So I asked them:
c56085	What is this high place
c56086	to which you go?’
c56087	(And to this day it is called Bamah.)
c56088	Therefore
c56089	tell the house of Israel
c56090	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56091	‘Will you defile yourselves the way your fathers did,
c56092	prostituting yourselves with their abominations?
c56093	When you offer your gifts,
c56094	sacrificing your sons in the fire,
c56095	you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day.
c56096	So should I be consulted by you,
c56097	O house of Israel?
c56098	As surely as I live,
c56099	declares the Lord GOD,
c56100	I will not be consulted by you!
c56102	what you have in mind
c56103	will never happen.
c56104	When you say:
c56105	“Let us be like the nations, like the peoples of the lands,
c56106	serving wood and stone,”
c56107	As surely as I live,
c56108	declares the Lord GOD,
c56109	with a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath I will rule over you.
c56110	I will bring you from the peoples
c56111	and gather you from the lands
c56112	to which you were scattered.
c56113	With a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath
c56114	And I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations,
c56115	[where] I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
c56116	Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt,
c56117	so I will enter into judgment with you,
c56118	declares of the Lord GOD.
c56119	I will make you pass under the rod
c56120	and will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
c56121	And I will purge you
c56122	of those who rebel
c56123	and transgress against Me.
c56124	I will bring them out of the land in which they dwell,
c56125	but they will not enter the land of Israel.
c56126	Then you will know
c56127	that I am the LORD.’
c56128	And as for you,
c56129	O house of Israel,
c56130	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56131	your idols, every one of you.
c56132	‘Go
c56133	and serve
c56134	But afterward,
c56135	you will surely listen to Me,
c56136	and you will no longer defile My holy name with your gifts and idols.
c56137	For on My holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel,
c56138	declares the Lord GOD,
c56139	there the whole house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land.
c56140	There I will accept
c56141	them and will require your offerings and choice gifts, along with all your holy sacrifices.
c56142	I will accept you as a pleasing aroma.
c56143	When I bring you from the peoples
c56144	and gather you from the lands
c56145	to which you have been scattered,
c56146	And I will show My holiness through you in the sight of the nations.
c56147	Then you will know
c56148	that I am the LORD,
c56149	when I bring you into the land of Israel, the land
c56150	I swore
c56151	to give your fathers.
c56152	There you will remember your ways and all the deeds
c56153	with which you have defiled yourselves,
c56154	and you will loathe yourselves for all the evils
c56155	you have done.
c56156	Then you will know,
c56157	that I am the LORD,
c56158	when I have dealt with you for the sake of My name and not according to your wicked ways and corrupt acts,
c56159	O house of Israel,
c56160	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c56161	Now the word of the LORD came to me,
c56162	saying,
c56163	“Son of man,
c56164	set your face toward the south,
c56165	preach against it,
c56166	and prophesy against the forest of the Negev.
c56167	Say to the forest of the Negev:
c56168	Hear the word of the LORD!
c56169	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c56170	‘I am about to ignite in you a fire,
c56171	and it will devour all your trees, both green [and] dry.
c56172	The blazing flame will not be quenched,
c56173	and by it every face from south to north will be scorched.
c56174	Then all people will see
c56175	that I, the LORD, have kindled it;
c56176	it will not be quenched.’”
c56177	Then I said,
c56178	“Ah,
c56179	Lord GOD,
c56180	they are saying of me,
c56181	‘Is he not [just] telling parables?’”
c56182	And the word of the LORD came to me,
c56183	saying,
c56184	“Son of man,
c56185	set your face toward Jerusalem
c56186	and preach against the sanctuaries.
c56187	Prophesy against the land of Israel
c56188	and tell [her]
c56189	that this is what the LORD says:
c56190	‘I am against you,
c56191	and I will draw My sword from its sheath
c56192	and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
c56193	Because I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked,
c56194	My sword will be unsheathed against everyone from south to north.
c56195	Then all flesh will know
c56196	that I, the LORD, have taken My sword from its sheath,
c56197	not to return it again.’
c56198	But you,
c56199	son of man,
c56200	groan! ... with a broken heart
c56201	Groan before their eyes ... and bitter grief.
c56202	and it will surely happen,
c56203	And when they ask,
c56204	‘Why are you groaning?’
c56205	you are to say,
c56206	‘Because of the news
c56207	that is coming.
c56208	Every heart will melt,
c56209	and every hand will go limp.
c56210	Every spirit will faint,
c56211	and every knee will turn to water.’
c56212	Yes, it is coming
c56214	declares the Lord GOD.”
c56215	Again the word of the LORD came to me,
c56216	saying,
c56217	“Son of man,
c56218	prophesy
c56219	says:
c56220	and tell them that this is what the Lord
c56222	‘A sword,
c56223	a sword, sharpened
c56224	and polished—
c56225	for the slaughter,
c56226	it is sharpened
c56227	to flash like lightning!
c56228	polished
c56229	Should we rejoice
c56230	in the scepter of My son? The sword despises every tree.
c56231	is appointed
c56232	to be polished,
c56233	to be grasped in the hand.
c56234	The sword ... It is sharpened
c56235	and polished,
c56236	to be placed in the hand of the slayer.
c56237	Cry out
c56238	and wail,
c56239	O son of man,
c56240	for it is against My people;
c56241	it is against all the princes of Israel!
c56242	They are tossed to the sword with My people;
c56243	therefore strike your thigh.
c56244	Surely a trial will come!
c56245	And what
c56246	if even the scepter, [which the] [sword] despises,
c56247	does not continue?
c56248	declares the Lord GOD.
c56249	So then,
c56250	son of man,
c56251	prophesy
c56252	and strike your hands together.
c56253	Let the sword strike two times, even three.
c56254	It is a sword [that] slays,
c56255	a sword that slays the great—
c56256	it surrounds them!
c56257	So that their hearts may melt
c56258	and many may stumble,
c56259	I have appointed at all their gates a sword for slaughter.
c56260	Yes,
c56261	it is ready to flash like lightning;
c56262	it is drawn for slaughter.
c56263	Slash
c56264	to the right;
c56265	set your blade
c56266	to the left—
c56267	wherever your blade is directed.
c56268	I too will strike My hands together,
c56269	and I will satisfy My wrath.
c56270	I, the LORD, have spoken.’”
c56271	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c56272	saying,
c56273	“Now you,
c56274	son of man,
c56275	mark out two roads
c56276	for the sword of the king of Babylon to take,
c56277	both starting from the same land.
c56278	And make a signpost
c56279	where the road branches off to each city.
c56280	Mark out one road
c56281	for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and [another] against Judah into fortified Jerusalem.
c56282	For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads,
c56283	to seek an omen:
c56284	He shakes the arrows,
c56285	he consults the idols,
c56286	he examines the liver.
c56287	In his right hand appears the portent for Jerusalem,
c56288	where he is to set up battering rams,
c56289	to call for the slaughter,
c56290	to lift a battle cry,
c56291	to set the battering rams against the gates,
c56292	to build a ramp,
c56293	and to erect a siege wall.
c56294	It will seem like
c56295	a false omen to the eyes
c56296	of those who have sworn allegiance to him,
c56297	but it will draw attention to their guilt
c56298	and take them captive.
c56299	Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56300	‘Because you have drawn attention to your guilt,
c56301	exposing your transgressions,
c56302	so that your sins are revealed in all your deeds—
c56303	because you have come to remembrance,
c56304	you shall be taken in hand.
c56305	And you,
c56306	O profane and wicked prince of Israel,
c56307	the day has come for your final punishment.’
c56308	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c56309	‘Remove the turban,
c56310	and take off the crown.
c56311	Things will not remain as they are:
c56312	Exalt the lowly
c56313	and bring low the exalted.
c56314	A ruin, a ruin, I will make it a ruin!
c56315	And it will not be restored
c56316	until He comes
c56317	to whom it belongs, ... judgment.’
c56318	to whom I have assigned
c56319	Now
c56320	son of man,
c56321	prophesy,
c56322	and declare
c56323	that this is what the Lord GOD says concerning the Ammonites and their contempt:
c56325	‘A sword! A sword
c56326	is drawn for slaughter,
c56327	polished
c56328	to consume,
c56329	to flash like lightning.
c56330	While they offer false visions for you
c56331	and lying divinations about you,
c56332	to be placed on the necks of the wicked who are slain,
c56333	whose day has come— the time of their final punishment.
c56334	Return [the sword] to its sheath!
c56335	In the place
c56336	where you were created,
c56337	in the land of your origin, I will judge you.
c56338	I will pour out My anger upon you;
c56339	I will breath the fire of My fury against you;
c56340	I will hand you over to brutal men, skilled in destruction.
c56341	You will be fuel for the fire.
c56342	Your blood will stain your own land.
c56343	You will not be remembered,
c56344	for I, the LORD, have spoken.’”
c56345	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c56346	saying,
c56347	“As for you,
c56348	son of man,
c56349	will you judge her?
c56350	Will you pass judgment on the city of bloodshed?
c56351	Then confront her with all her abominations
c56352	and tell her
c56353	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56354	‘O city
c56355	by shedding blood within her walls
c56356	who brings her own doom
c56357	and making idols
c56358	to defile herself,
c56359	of the blood
c56360	you have shed,
c56361	you are guilty
c56362	by the idols
c56363	you have made.
c56364	and you are defiled
c56365	You have brought your days to a close
c56366	and have come to [the] [end] [of] your years.
c56367	Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations
c56368	and a mockery to all the lands.
c56369	Those near
c56370	and far
c56371	will mock you,
c56372	O infamous [city], full of turmoil.
c56373	See how ... prince of Israel
c56374	every ... his power
c56375	within you has used
c56376	to shed blood.
c56377	Father and mother are treated with contempt. Within your walls
c56378	the foreign resident is exploited,
c56379	the fatherless and the widow are oppressed.
c56380	You have despised My holy things
c56381	and profaned My Sabbaths.
c56382	Among you are slanderous men
c56383	bent on bloodshed;
c56384	within you are those who eat on the mountain [shrines]
c56385	and commit acts of indecency.
c56386	In you they have uncovered the nakedness of their fathers;
c56387	in you they violate women during their impurity.
c56388	One man commits an abomination with his neighbor’s wife;
c56389	another wickedly defiles his daughter-in-law;
c56390	and yet another violates his sister, his own father’s daughter.
c56391	In you they take bribes
c56392	to shed blood.
c56393	You engage in usury, ... excess interest,
c56394	take ... and extort your neighbors.
c56395	But Me you have forgotten,
c56396	declares the Lord GOD.
c56397	Now look, I strike My hands together against your unjust gain
c56399	and against the blood you have shed
c56400	in your midst.
c56401	Will your courage endure
c56402	or your hands be strong in the day
c56403	I deal with you?
c56404	I, the LORD, have spoken,
c56405	and I will act.
c56406	I will disperse you among the nations
c56407	and scatter you throughout the lands;
c56408	I will purge your uncleanness.
c56409	And when you have defiled yourself in the eyes of the nations,
c56410	then you will know
c56411	that I am the LORD.’”
c56412	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c56413	saying,
c56414	“Son of man,
c56415	the house of Israel has become dross to Me.
c56416	All of them are copper, tin, iron, and lead inside the furnace;
c56417	they are but the dross of silver.
c56418	Therefore
c56419	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56420	‘Because all of you have become dross,
c56421	behold, I will gather you into Jerusalem.
c56422	Just as one gathers silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin into the furnace
c56423	with a fiery blast,
c56424	to melt
c56425	so I will gather you in My anger and wrath,
c56426	leave [you] [there],
c56427	and melt you.
c56428	Yes, I will gather you together
c56429	and blow on you with the fire of My wrath,
c56430	and you will be melted within the city.
c56431	As silver is melted in a furnace,
c56432	so you will be melted inside the city.
c56433	Then you will know
c56434	that I, the LORD, have poured out My wrath upon you.’”
c56435	And the word of the LORD came to me,
c56436	saying,
c56437	“Son of man,
c56438	say to her,
c56439	you are a land
c56440	that has not been cleansed, upon which
c56441	‘In the day of indignation, ... [no] rain has fallen.’
c56442	The conspiracy of the princes in her midst is like a roaring lion
c56443	tearing its prey.
c56444	They devour the people,
c56445	seize the treasures and precious things,
c56446	and multiply the widows within her.
c56447	Her priests do violence to My law
c56448	and profane My holy things.
c56449	They make no distinction between the holy and the common,
c56450	and they fail to distinguish between the clean and the unclean.
c56451	They disregard My Sabbaths,
c56452	so that I am profaned among them.
c56453	Her officials within
c56454	her are like wolves tearing their prey,
c56455	shedding blood,
c56456	and destroying lives
c56457	for dishonest gain.
c56458	Her prophets whitewash [these deeds]
c56459	by false visions
c56460	and lying divinations,
c56461	saying,
c56462	‘This is what the Lord GOD says,’
c56463	when the LORD has not spoken.
c56464	The people of the land have practiced extortion
c56465	and committed robbery.
c56466	They have oppressed the poor and needy,
c56467	and exploited the foreign resident without justice.
c56468	I searched for a man among them
c56469	to repair the wall
c56470	and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land,
c56471	so that I should not destroy it.
c56472	But I found no one.
c56473	So I have poured out My indignation upon them
c56474	and consumed them with the fire of My fury.
c56475	I have brought their ways down upon their own heads,
c56476	declares the Lord GOD.”
c56477	Again the word of the LORD came to me,
c56478	saying,
c56479	“Son of man,
c56480	there were two women, daughters of the same mother,
c56481	and they played in Egypt,
c56482	prostituting themselves from their youth.
c56483	Their breasts were fondled there,
c56484	and their virgin bosoms caressed.
c56485	was named
c56486	The older ... Oholah,
c56487	and her sister was Oholibah.
c56488	They became Mine
c56489	and gave birth to sons and daughters.
c56490	[As] [for] their identities,
c56491	Oholah [is] Samaria,
c56492	and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
c56493	Oholah prostituted herself while she was still Mine.
c56494	She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians— warriors
c56495	clothed in blue,
c56496	governors and commanders,
c56497	all desirable young men,
c56498	horsemen
c56499	mounted on steeds.
c56500	She offered sexual favors
c56501	to all the elite of Assyria.
c56502	with all
c56503	of those for whom she lusted.
c56504	She defiled herself ... the idols
c56505	She did not give up the prostitution [she began] in Egypt,
c56506	when men slept with her in her youth,
c56507	caressed her virgin bosom,
c56508	and poured out their lust upon her.
c56509	Therefore I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians
c56510	for whom she lusted.
c56511	They exposed her nakedness,
c56512	seized her sons and daughters,
c56513	and put her to the sword.
c56514	Thus she became a byword among women,
c56515	and they executed judgment against her.
c56516	Her sister Oholibah saw [this],
c56517	yet in her lust ... she was more depraved
c56518	and prostitution ... than her sister.
c56519	She too lusted after the Assyrians—
c56520	governors and commanders, warriors
c56521	dressed in splendor,
c56522	horsemen
c56523	riding on steeds,
c56524	all desirable young men.
c56525	And I saw
c56526	that she too had defiled herself;
c56527	both of them had taken the same path.
c56528	But [Oholibah] carried her prostitution {even further}.
c56529	She saw the men
c56530	portrayed on the wall,
c56531	images of the Chaldeans,
c56532	engraved in vermilion,
c56533	wearing belts on their waists
c56534	and flowing turbans on their heads;
c56535	all of them looked like officers of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth.
c56536	At the sight of them she lusted for them
c56537	and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
c56538	Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love,
c56539	and in their lust they defiled her.
c56540	But after she had been defiled by them,
c56541	she turned away in disgust.
c56542	When [Oholibah] openly prostituted herself
c56543	and exposed her nakedness,
c56544	I turned away from her in disgust,
c56545	just as I had turned away from her sister.
c56546	Yet she multiplied her promiscuity,
c56547	remembering the days of her youth,
c56548	when she had prostituted herself in the land of Egypt
c56549	and lusted after their lovers,
c56550	whose genitals were like those of donkeys
c56551	and whose emission was like that of stallions.
c56552	So you revisited the indecency of your youth,
c56553	when the Egyptians caressed your bosom and pressed your young breasts.
c56554	Therefore,
c56555	Oholibah,
c56556	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56557	‘I will incite your lovers against you,
c56558	those from whom you turned in disgust.
c56559	And I will bring them against you from every side—
c56560	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, [the men of] Pekod, Shoa, and Koa,
c56561	and all the Assyrians with them—
c56562	all desirable young men,
c56563	governors and commanders,
c56564	officers
c56565	and administrators, mounted on horses.
c56566	They will come against you ... with weapons, chariots, and wagons.
c56567	with a host of peoples,
c56568	They will array themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and helmet.
c56569	I will delegate judgment to them,
c56570	and they will punish you by their own standards.
c56571	And I will set My jealous rage against you,
c56572	and they will deal with you in fury.
c56573	They will cut off your noses and ears,
c56574	and your survivors will fall by the sword.
c56575	They will seize your sons and daughters,
c56576	and your remnant will be consumed by fire.
c56577	They will strip off your clothes
c56578	and take your fine jewelry.
c56579	So I will put an end to your indecency
c56580	and prostitution, which began in the land of Egypt,
c56581	and you will not lift your eyes to them
c56582	or remember Egypt anymore.’
c56583	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56584	‘Surely I will deliver you into the hands of those
c56585	you hate,
c56587	from whom you turned away in disgust.
c56588	They will treat you with hatred,
c56589	take all for which you have worked,
c56590	and leave you naked and bare,
c56591	so that the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your indecency and promiscuity
c56592	have brought these things upon you,
c56593	because you have prostituted yourself with the nations
c56594	and defiled yourself with their idols.
c56595	Because you have followed the path of your sister,
c56596	I will put her cup into your hand.’
c56597	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c56598	‘You will drink your sister’s cup, a cup deep and wide.
c56599	It will bring scorn and derision,
c56600	so much.
c56601	for it holds
c56602	You will be filled with drunkenness and grief,
c56603	with a cup of devastation and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.
c56604	You will drink
c56605	it dry;
c56606	you will dash it to pieces,
c56607	and tear your breasts.
c56608	For I have spoken,’
c56609	declares the Lord GOD.
c56610	Therefore,
c56611	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56612	‘Because you have forgotten Me
c56613	and have cast Me behind your back,
c56614	you must bear the consequences [of] your indecency and prostitution.’”
c56615	Then the LORD said to me:
c56616	“Son of man,
c56617	will you pass judgment against Oholah and Oholibah?
c56618	Then declare to them their abominations.
c56619	For they have committed adultery,
c56620	and blood is on their hands;
c56621	they have committed adultery with their idols.
c56622	They have even sacrificed their children,
c56623	whom they bore to Me,
c56624	in the fire as food for their idols.
c56625	They have also done to Me this:
c56626	On that very same day they defiled My sanctuary
c56627	and profaned My Sabbaths.
c56628	they slaughtered their children for their idols,
c56629	On the very day ... they entered My sanctuary
c56630	to profane it.
c56631	Yes, this they did inside My house.
c56632	Furthermore, they sent ... for men
c56633	who came from afar;
c56634	messengers
c56635	and behold, when they arrived,
c56636	you bathed for them,
c56637	painted your eyes,
c56638	and adorned yourself with jewelry.
c56639	You sat on a couch of luxury
c56640	with a table spread before it,
c56641	on which you had set My incense and My oil.
c56642	The sound of a carefree crowd accompanied her.
c56643	Sabeans were brought in from the desert along with men from the rabble,
c56644	who put bracelets on your wrists
c56645	and beautiful crowns on your head.
c56646	Then I said of [her] [who] [had] [grown] old in adulteries:
c56647	‘Now let them use her as a prostitute,
c56648	for that is all she is!’
c56649	And they slept with her
c56650	a prostitute; they slept with
c56651	as with ... Oholah and Oholibah, those lewd women.
c56652	But righteous men
c56653	will sentence them to the punishment of those who commit adultery and bloodshed,
c56654	because they are adulteresses
c56655	with blood on their hands.
c56656	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c56657	‘Bring a mob against them
c56658	and consign them to terror and plunder.
c56659	The mob will stone them and cut them
c56660	down with their swords.
c56661	They will kill their sons and daughters
c56662	and burn down their houses.
c56663	So I will put an end to indecency in the land,
c56664	and all the women will be admonished
c56665	not to imitate your behavior.
c56666	They will repay you for your indecency,
c56667	and you will bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry.
c56668	Then you will know
c56669	that I am the Lord GOD.’”
c56670	In the ninth year, on the tenth day of the tenth month, the word of the LORD came to me,
c56671	saying,
c56672	“Son of man,
c56673	write down today’s date,
c56674	for on this very day
c56675	the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem.
c56676	Now speak a parable to this rebellious house
c56677	and tell them
c56678	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56679	‘Put the pot on the fire;
c56680	put it on
c56681	and pour in the water.
c56682	Put in the pieces of meat, every good piece— thigh and shoulder—
c56683	fill it with choice bones.
c56684	Take the choicest of the flock
c56685	and pile the fuel beneath it. ... the bones
c56686	Bring it to a boil
c56687	and cook ... in it.’
c56688	Therefore
c56689	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56690	‘Woe to the city of bloodshed,
c56691	to the pot
c56692	now rusted,
c56693	whose rust will not come off
c56694	!Empty it piece by piece;
c56695	cast no lots for its contents.
c56696	For the blood she shed is still within her;
c56697	she poured it out on the bare rock;
c56698	she did not pour it on the ground
c56699	to cover it with dust.
c56700	In order to stir up wrath
c56701	and take vengeance,
c56702	I have placed her blood on the bare rock,
c56703	so that it would not be covered.’
c56704	Therefore
c56705	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56706	‘Woe to the city of bloodshed!
c56707	I, too, will pile the kindling high.
c56708	Pile on the logs
c56709	and kindle the fire;
c56710	cook the meat well
c56711	and mix in the spices;
c56712	let the bones be burned.
c56713	Set the empty pot on its coals
c56714	until it becomes hot
c56715	and its copper glows.
c56716	Then its impurity will melt within;
c56717	its rust will be consumed.
c56718	It has frustrated every effort;
c56719	its thick rust has not been removed
c56720	,even by the fire.
c56721	of the indecency of your uncleanness
c56722	Because ... I tried to cleanse you,
c56723	but you would not be purified from your filthiness.
c56724	You will not be pure again
c56725	until My wrath against you has subsided.
c56726	I, the LORD, have spoken;
c56727	[the time] is coming,
c56728	and I will act.
c56729	I will not refrain
c56730	[or] show pity,
c56731	nor will I relent.
c56732	I will judge you according to your ways and deeds,’
c56733	declares the Lord GOD.”
c56734	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c56735	saying,
c56736	“Son of man,
c56737	behold, I am about to take away the desire of your eyes with a fatal blow.
c56738	But you must not lament
c56739	or weep
c56740	or let your tears flow.
c56741	Groan
c56742	quietly;
c56743	do not mourn for the dead.
c56744	Put on your turban
c56745	and strap your sandals on your feet;
c56746	do not cover [your] lips
c56747	or eat the bread of mourners.”
c56748	So I spoke to the people in the morning,
c56749	and in the evening my wife died.
c56750	And the next morning I did
c56751	as I had been commanded.
c56752	Then the people asked me,
c56753	“Won't you tell us
c56754	what these [things] ... mean to us?”
c56755	you are doing
c56756	So I answered them,
c56757	“The word of the LORD came to me,
c56758	saying:
c56759	Tell the house of Israel
c56760	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56761	‘I am about to desecrate My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and the delight of your soul.
c56762	And the sons and daughters
c56763	you left behind
c56764	will fall by the sword.
c56765	Then you will do
c56766	as I have done:
c56767	You will not cover [your] lips
c56768	or eat the bread of mourners.
c56769	Your turbans will remain on your heads
c56770	and your sandals on your feet.
c56771	You will not mourn
c56772	or weep,
c56773	but you will waste away because of your sins
c56774	and groan
c56775	among yourselves.
c56776	Thus Ezekiel will be a sign for you;
c56777	everything
c56778	you will do ... that
c56779	he has done.
c56780	When this happens,
c56781	you will know
c56782	that I am the Lord GOD.’
c56783	And you,
c56784	son of man,
c56785	know that on the day
c56786	I take away their stronghold, their pride and joy— the desire of their eyes, on which they set their minds— and their sons and daughters as well,
c56787	on that day a fugitive will come and tell you the news.
c56788	On that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped;
c56789	you will speak
c56790	and no longer be mute.
c56791	So you will be a sign for them,
c56792	and they will know
c56793	that I am the LORD.”
c56794	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c56795	saying,
c56796	“Son of man,
c56797	set your face against the Ammonites
c56798	and prophesy against them.
c56799	Tell the Ammonites
c56800	to hear the word of the Lord GOD,
c56801	for this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56802	‘Because you exclaimed,
c56803	“Aha!”
c56804	when My sanctuary
c56805	was profaned,
c56806	when the land of Israel
c56807	was laid waste,
c56808	and when the house of Judah
c56809	went into exile,
c56810	therefore
c56811	I will indeed give you as a possession to the people of the east.
c56812	They will set up their encampments
c56813	and pitch their tents among you.
c56814	They will eat your fruit
c56815	and drink your milk.
c56816	I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels,
c56817	and Ammon a resting place for sheep.
c56818	Then you will know
c56819	that I am the LORD.’
c56820	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56821	‘Because you clapped your hands,
c56822	and stomped your feet
c56823	and rejoiced over the land of Israel with a heart full of contempt,
c56824	therefore
c56825	I will indeed stretch out My hand against you
c56826	and give you as plunder to the nations.
c56827	I will cut you off from the peoples
c56828	and exterminate you from the countries.
c56829	I will destroy you,
c56830	and you will know
c56831	that I am the LORD.’
c56832	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c56833	‘Because Moab and Seir said,
c56834	“Look, the house of Judah is like all the other nations,”
c56835	therefore
c56836	I will indeed expose the flank of Moab beginning with its frontier cities—
c56837	Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim— the glory of the land.
c56838	along with the Ammonites ... to the people of the East,
c56839	I will give it ... as a possession
c56840	so that the Ammonites will no longer be remembered among the nations.
c56841	So I will execute judgments on Moab,
c56842	and they will know
c56843	that I am the LORD.’
c56844	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c56845	‘Because Edom acted
c56846	vengefully against the house of Judah
c56847	incurred grievous guilt,
c56848	and in [so doing]
c56849	therefore
c56850	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56851	I will stretch out My hand against Edom
c56852	and cut off from it both man and beast.
c56853	I will make it a wasteland, and from Teman to Dedan
c56854	they will fall by the sword.
c56855	I will take My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel,
c56856	and they will deal with Edom according to My anger and wrath.
c56857	Then they will know My vengeance,
c56858	declares the Lord GOD.’
c56859	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c56860	‘Because the Philistines acted in vengeance
c56861	and took revenge with contempt of heart, to destroy [Judah] with ancient hostility,
c56862	therefore
c56863	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56864	Behold, I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines,
c56865	and I will cut off the Cherethites
c56866	and destroy the remnant along the coast.
c56867	I will execute great vengeance against them with furious reproof,
c56868	and they will know
c56869	that I am the LORD
c56870	when I take My vengeance upon them.’”
c56871	In the eleventh [month of the twelfth] year, on the first day of the month, ... came
c56872	the word of the LORD ... to me,
c56873	saying,
c56874	“Son of man,
c56875	because Tyre has said of Jerusalem,
c56876	‘Aha!
c56877	The gate to the nations is broken;
c56878	it has swung open to me;
c56879	I will be filled,’
c56880	now that she lies in ruins
c56881	therefore
c56882	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56883	‘Behold, ... [I am] against you;
c56884	O Tyre,
c56885	and I will raise up many nations against you,
c56886	as the sea brings up its waves.
c56887	They will destroy the walls of Tyre
c56888	and demolish her towers.
c56889	I will scrape the soil from her
c56890	and make her a bare rock.
c56891	She will become a place to spread nets in the sea,
c56892	for I have spoken,
c56893	declares the Lord GOD.
c56894	She will become plunder for the nations,
c56895	and the villages
c56896	on her mainland
c56897	will be slain by the sword.
c56898	Then they will know
c56899	that I am the LORD.’
c56900	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56901	‘Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with cavalry and a great company of troops.
c56902	He will slaughter the villages of your mainland with the sword;
c56903	he will set up siege works against you,
c56904	build a ramp to your walls,
c56905	and raise his shields against you.
c56906	He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls
c56907	and tear down your towers with his axes.
c56908	His multitude of horses will cover you in their dust.
c56909	your walls will shake from the noise of cavalry, wagons, and chariots.
c56910	When he enters your gates as an army entering a breached city,
c56911	The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets.
c56912	He will slaughter your people with the sword,
c56913	and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground.
c56914	They will plunder your wealth
c56915	and pillage your merchandise.
c56916	They will demolish your walls,
c56917	tear down your beautiful homes,
c56918	and throw your stones and timber and soil into the water.
c56919	So I will silence the sound of your songs,
c56920	and the music of your lyres will no longer be heard.
c56921	I will make you a bare rock,
c56922	and you will become a place to spread the fishing nets.
c56923	You will never be rebuilt,
c56924	for I, ... have spoken, ... GOD.’
c56925	the LORD, ... declares the Lord
c56926	This is what the Lord GOD says to Tyre:
c56927	‘Will not ... at the sound of your downfall,
c56928	when the wounded groan
c56929	at the slaughter in your midst?
c56930	the coasts and islands quake
c56931	All the princes of the sea will descend from their thrones,
c56932	remove their robes,
c56933	and strip off their embroidered garments.
c56934	Clothed with terror,
c56935	they will sit on the ground,
c56936	trembling [every] moment,
c56937	appalled over you.
c56938	Then they will lament for you,
c56939	saying,
c56940	“How you have perished,
c56941	inhabited by seafaring [men]!
c56942	O city
c56943	of renown,
c56944	She who was powerful on the sea, along with her people,
c56945	who brought terror to all who lived there.
c56946	Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your downfall;
c56947	the islands ... are dismayed
c56948	in the sea
c56949	by your demise.”’
c56950	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56951	‘When I make you
c56952	a desolate city
c56953	cities,
c56954	like other deserted
c56955	when I raise up the deep against you
c56956	so that the mighty waters cover you,
c56957	then I will bring you down with those who descend to the Pit, to the people of antiquity.
c56958	I will make you dwell in the earth below like the ancient ruins, with those who descend to the Pit,
c56959	so that you will no longer be inhabited
c56960	or set in splendor in the land of the living.
c56961	I will make you an object of horror,
c56962	and you will be no more.
c56963	You will be sought,
c56964	but will never be found,
c56965	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c56966	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c56967	saying,
c56968	“Now you,
c56969	son of man,
c56970	take up a lament for Tyre.
c56971	Tell Tyre,
c56972	who dwells at the gateway to the sea,
c56973	merchant of the peoples on many coasts,
c56974	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c56975	O Tyre,
c56976	‘You have said,
c56977	“I am perfect in beauty.”
c56978	Your borders are in the heart of the seas;
c56979	your builders perfected your beauty.
c56980	They constructed all your planking with pine trees from Senir.
c56981	They took a cedar from Lebanon
c56982	to make a mast for you.
c56983	[Of] oaks from Bashan they made your oars;
c56984	of wood from the coasts of Cyprus they made your deck, inlaid with ivory.
c56985	Of embroidered fine linen from Egypt, they made your sail,
c56986	which served as your banner.
c56987	Of blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah they made your awning.
c56988	The men of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen.
c56989	Your men of skill,
c56990	O Tyre,
c56991	were [there]
c56992	as your captains.
c56993	The elders of Gebal were aboard as shipwrights,
c56994	repairing your leaks.
c56995	All the ships of the sea and their sailors came alongside
c56996	to barter for your goods.
c56997	Men of Persia, Lydia, and Put served as warriors in your army.
c56998	They hung shields and helmets on your walls;
c56999	they gave you splendor.
c57000	Men of Arvad and Helech manned your walls all around,
c57001	and the [men] of Gammad were in your towers.
c57002	They hung their shields all around your walls;
c57003	they perfected your beauty.
c57004	Tarshish [was] your merchant because of your great wealth of goods;
c57005	they exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your wares.
c57006	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech
c57007	were your merchants.
c57008	They exchanged slaves and bronze utensils for your merchandise.
c57009	The men of Beth-togarmah exchanged horses, war horses, and mules for your wares.
c57010	The men of Dedan [were] your clients;
c57011	many coastlands
c57012	were your market; they paid you with ivory tusks and ebony.
c57013	Aram was your customer because of the abundance of your goods;
c57014	they exchanged turquoise, purple, embroidery, fine linen, coral, and rubies for your wares.
c57015	Judah and the land of Israel
c57016	traded with you;
c57017	they exchanged wheat from Minnith, cakes and honey, oil and balm for your merchandise.
c57018	Because of your many products ... Damascus traded with you
c57019	and your great wealth of goods, ... wine from Helbon, wool from Zahar,
c57020	and casks of wine from Izal for your wares. Wrought iron, ... were exchanged
c57021	cassia, and sweet cane ... for your merchandise.
c57022	Dedan was your merchant in saddlecloths for riding.
c57023	Arabia and all the princes of Kedar
c57024	were your customers,
c57025	in lambs, rams, and goats.
c57026	trading
c57027	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah
c57028	traded with you;
c57029	for your wares they exchanged gold, the finest of all spices, and precious stones.
c57030	Haran, Canneh, and Eden, and the merchants of Sheba,
c57031	Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you.
c57032	In your marketplace they traded with you fine garments of blue and embroidered work, and multicolored rugs, bound and secured with cords.
c57033	The ships of Tarshish carried your merchandise.
c57034	And you were filled
c57035	with heavy cargo in the heart of the sea.
c57036	have brought you onto the high seas,
c57037	Your oarsmen
c57038	but the east wind will shatter you in the heart of the sea.
c57039	Your wealth, wares, and goods, your sailors, captains, and shipwrights, your merchants and all the warriors within you,
c57041	with all the other people on board,
c57043	will sink into the heart of the sea on the day of your downfall.
c57044	The countryside will shake when your sailors cry out.
c57045	All who handle the oars will abandon their ships.
c57046	The sailors and all the captains of the sea will stand on the shore.
c57047	They will raise their voices for you
c57048	and cry out bitterly.
c57049	They will throw dust on their heads
c57050	and roll in ashes.
c57051	They will shave their heads for you
c57052	and wrap themselves in sackcloth.
c57053	They will weep over you with anguish of soul and bitter mourning.
c57054	As they wail ... they will take up a lament for you:
c57055	and mourn over you,
c57056	Who was ever like Tyre,
c57057	silenced in the middle of the sea?
c57058	When your merchandise went out to sea,
c57059	you satisfied many nations.
c57060	You enriched the kings of the earth with your abundant wealth and goods.
c57061	Now
c57062	you are shattered by the seas in the depths of the waters;
c57063	your goods and the people among you have gone down with you.
c57064	All the people of the coastlands are appalled over you.
c57065	Their kings shudder with fear;
c57066	their faces are contorted.
c57067	Those who trade among the nations hiss at you;
c57068	you have come to a horrible end
c57069	and will be no more.’”
c57070	And the word of the LORD came to me,
c57071	saying,
c57072	“Son of man,
c57073	tell the ruler of Tyre
c57074	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57075	‘Your heart is proud,
c57076	and you have said,
c57077	“I am a god;
c57078	I sit in the seat of gods in the heart of the sea.”
c57079	Yet you are a man
c57080	and not a god,
c57081	though you have regarded your heart as that of a god.
c57082	Behold, you are wiser than Daniel;
c57083	no secret is hidden from you!
c57084	By your wisdom and understanding you have gained your wealth
c57085	and amassed gold and silver for your treasuries.
c57086	By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth,
c57087	but your heart has grown proud because of [it].’
c57088	Therefore
c57089	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57090	‘Because you regard your heart as the heart of a god,
c57092	behold, I will bring foreigners against you, the most ruthless of nations.
c57093	They will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom
c57094	and will defile your splendor.
c57095	They will bring you down to the Pit,
c57096	and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.
c57097	Will you still say,
c57098	“I am a god,”
c57099	in the presence of those who slay you?
c57100	You will be only a man,
c57101	not a god,
c57102	in the hands of those who wound you.
c57103	You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners.
c57104	For I have spoken,
c57105	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c57106	Again the word of the LORD came to me,
c57107	saying,
c57108	“Son of man,
c57109	take up a lament for the king of Tyre
c57110	and tell him
c57111	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57112	‘You were the seal of perfection,
c57113	full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
c57114	You were in Eden, the garden of God.
c57115	Every kind of precious stone adorned you:
c57116	ruby, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald.
c57117	Your mountings and settings were crafted in gold,
c57118	on the day
c57119	of your creation.
c57120	prepared
c57121	You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
c57122	for I had ordained you.
c57123	You were on the holy mountain of God;
c57124	you walked among the fiery stones.
c57125	From the day ... you were blameless in your ways
c57126	you were created
c57127	until wickedness was found in you.
c57128	By the vastness of your trade, you were filled with violence,
c57129	and you sinned.
c57130	So I drove you in disgrace from the mountain of God,
c57131	and I banished you,
c57132	cherub,
c57133	O guardian
c57134	from among the fiery stones.
c57135	Your heart grew proud of your beauty;
c57136	you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor;
c57137	so I cast you to the earth;
c57138	I made you ... before kings.
c57139	a spectacle
c57140	By the multitude of your iniquities and the dishonesty of your trading you have profaned your sanctuaries.
c57141	So I made fire come from within you,
c57142	and it consumed you.
c57143	I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the eyes of all who saw you.
c57144	All the nations who know you are appalled over you.
c57145	You have come to a horrible end
c57146	and [will] [be] no more.’”
c57147	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c57148	saying,
c57149	“Son of man,
c57150	turn your face toward Sidon
c57151	and prophesy against her.
c57152	And you are to declare
c57153	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57154	‘Behold, I am against you,
c57155	O Sidon,
c57156	and I will be glorified within you.
c57157	They will know
c57158	that I am the LORD
c57159	when I execute judgments against her
c57160	and demonstrate My holiness through her.
c57161	I will send a plague against her and shed blood in her streets;
c57162	the slain will fall within her, while the sword is against her on every side.
c57163	Then they will know
c57164	that I am the LORD.
c57165	For the people of Israel will no longer face a pricking brier or a painful thorn from all around them
c57166	who treat them with contempt.
c57167	Then they will know
c57168	that I am the Lord GOD.’
c57169	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c57170	‘When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples
c57171	among whom they have been scattered,
c57172	I will show Myself holy among them in the sight of the nations.
c57173	Then they will dwell in their own land,
c57174	which I have given to My servant Jacob.
c57175	They will live there securely,
c57176	build houses,
c57177	and plant vineyards.
c57178	They will dwell securely
c57179	when I execute judgments against all
c57180	around them who treat them with contempt.
c57181	Then they will know
c57182	that I am the LORD their God.’”
c57183	In the tenth year, in the tenth [month], on the twelfth day,
c57184	the word of the LORD came to me,
c57185	saying,
c57186	“Son of man,
c57187	set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt
c57188	and prophesy against him and against all of Egypt.
c57189	Speak
c57190	to him and tell him
c57191	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57192	‘Behold, I am against you,
c57193	O Pharaoh king of Egypt, O great monster
c57194	who lies among his rivers,
c57195	who says,
c57196	“The Nile is mine;
c57197	I made it for myself.”
c57198	But I will put hooks in your jaws
c57199	and make the fish of your streams cling to your scales.
c57200	I will haul you up out of your rivers,
c57201	and all the fish of your streams will cling to your scales.
c57202	I will leave you in the desert, you and all the fish of your streams.
c57203	You will fall on the open field
c57204	and will not be taken away
c57205	or gathered for burial.
c57206	I have given you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air.
c57207	Then all the people of Egypt will know
c57208	that I am the LORD.
c57209	For you were only a staff of reeds to the house of Israel.
c57210	When Israel grasped you with their hands,
c57211	you splintered
c57212	and tore open their shoulders;
c57214	when they leaned on you,
c57215	you broke
c57216	and their backs were wrenched.’
c57217	Therefore
c57218	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57219	‘I will bring a sword against you
c57220	and cut off from you man and beast.
c57221	The land of Egypt will become a desolate wasteland.
c57222	Then they will know
c57223	that I am the LORD.
c57224	Because you said,
c57225	“The Nile [is] mine;
c57226	I made it,”
c57227	therefore
c57228	I am against you and against your rivers.
c57229	I will turn the land of Egypt into a ruin, a desolate wasteland from Migdol to Syene, and as far as the border of Cush.
c57230	No foot of man ... will pass through,
c57231	[or] beast
c57232	and it will be uninhabited for forty years.
c57233	I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among desolate lands,
c57234	and her cities will lie desolate forty years among the ruined cities.
c57235	And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations
c57236	and scatter them throughout the countries.’
c57237	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57238	‘At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations
c57239	to which they were scattered.
c57240	I will restore Egypt from captivity
c57241	and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin.
c57242	There they will be a lowly kingdom.
c57243	Egypt will be the lowliest of kingdoms
c57244	and will never again exalt itself above the nations.
c57245	For I will diminish [Egypt]
c57246	so that it will never again rule over the nations.
c57247	Egypt will never again be an object of trust for the house of Israel,
c57248	but will remind them of [their] iniquity
c57249	in turning to the Egyptians.
c57250	Then they will know
c57251	that I am the Lord GOD.’”
c57252	In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day, ... came
c57253	the word of the LORD ... to me,
c57254	saying,
c57255	“Son of man,
c57256	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to labor strenuously against Tyre.
c57257	Every head was made bald
c57258	and every shoulder made raw.
c57259	But he and his army had no wages from Tyre for the labor
c57260	they expended on it.
c57261	Therefore
c57262	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57263	‘I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
c57264	who will carry off its wealth,
c57265	seize its spoil,
c57266	and remove its plunder.
c57267	This will be the wages for his army.
c57268	as the reward
c57269	for his labor,
c57270	I have given him the land of Egypt
c57271	because it was done for Me,
c57272	declares the Lord GOD.’
c57273	In that day I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel,
c57274	and I will open your mouth to speak among them.
c57275	Then they will know
c57276	that I am the LORD.”
c57277	Again the word of the LORD came to me,
c57278	saying,
c57279	“Son of man,
c57280	prophesy
c57281	and declare
c57282	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57283	‘Wail,
c57284	“Alas, the day [is here]!”
c57285	For the day [is] near,
c57286	the Day of the LORD is near.
c57287	It will be a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations.
c57288	A sword will come against Egypt,
c57289	and there will be anguish in Cush
c57290	when the slain fall in Egypt,
c57291	its wealth is taken away,
c57292	and its foundations are torn down.
c57293	Cush, Put, and Lud, and all the various peoples, as well as Libya and the men of the covenant land, will fall by the sword along with [Egypt].’
c57294	For this is what ... says: ... GOD.
c57295	‘The allies of Egypt will fall,
c57296	and her proud strength will collapse. From Migdol to Syene
c57297	they will fall by the sword within her,
c57298	the LORD ... declares the Lord
c57299	They will be desolate among desolate lands,
c57300	and their cities will lie among ruined cities.
c57301	Then they will know
c57302	that I am the LORD
c57303	when I set fire to Egypt
c57304	and all her helpers are shattered.’
c57305	On that day messengers will go out from Me in ships,
c57306	to frighten Cush out of complacency.
c57307	Anguish will come upon them on the day of Egypt’s [doom].
c57308	For it is indeed coming.
c57309	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c57310	‘I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
c57311	He and his people with him, the most ruthless of the nations, will be brought in
c57312	to destroy the land.
c57313	They will draw their swords against Egypt
c57314	and fill the land with the slain.
c57315	I will make the streams dry up
c57316	and sell the land to the wicked.
c57317	By the hands of foreigners I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it.’
c57318	I, the LORD, have spoken.
c57319	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c57320	‘I will destroy the idols
c57321	and put an end to the images in Memphis.
c57322	There will no longer be a prince in Egypt,
c57323	and I will instill fear in that land.
c57324	I will lay waste to Pathros,
c57325	set fire to Zoan,
c57326	and execute judgment on Thebes.
c57327	I will pour out My wrath on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt,
c57328	and cut off the crowds of Thebes.
c57329	I will set fire to Egypt;
c57330	Pelusium will writhe in anguish,
c57331	Thebes will be
c57332	split open,
c57333	and Memphis [will face] daily distress.
c57334	The young men of On and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword,
c57335	and those [cities] will go into captivity.
c57336	The day will be darkened in Tehaphnehes
c57337	when I break there the yoke of Egypt
c57338	and her proud strength comes to an end.
c57340	A cloud will cover her,
c57341	and her daughters will go into captivity.
c57342	So I will execute judgment on Egypt,
c57343	and they will know
c57344	that I am the LORD.’”
c57345	In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day, ... came
c57346	the word of the LORD ... to me,
c57347	saying,
c57348	“Son of man,
c57349	I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
c57350	See,
c57351	it has not been bound
c57352	up for healing
c57353	or splinted
c57355	to give it strength
c57356	to handle a sword.
c57357	Therefore
c57358	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57359	‘Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt.
c57360	I will break his arms, both the strong one and the one already broken,
c57361	and will make the sword fall from his hand.
c57362	I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations
c57363	and scatter them throughout the lands.
c57364	I will strengthen the arms of Babylon’s king
c57365	and place My sword in his hand,
c57366	but I will break the arms of Pharaoh,
c57367	and he will groan before him like a [mortally] wounded [man].
c57368	I will strengthen the arms of Babylon’s king,
c57369	but Pharaoh’s arms will fall limp.
c57370	Then they will know
c57371	that I am the LORD,
c57372	when I place My sword in the hand of Babylon’s king,
c57373	and he wields it against the land of Egypt.
c57374	When I disperse the Egyptians among the nations
c57375	and scatter them throughout the lands,
c57376	they will know
c57377	that I am the LORD.’”
c57378	In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day, ... came
c57379	the word of the LORD ... to me,
c57380	saying,
c57381	“Son of man,
c57382	say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude:
c57383	‘Who can be compared to your greatness?
c57384	Look at Assyria, a cedar in Lebanon,
c57385	with beautiful branches
c57386	that shaded the forest.
c57387	It towered on high;
c57388	its top was among the clouds.
c57389	The waters made it grow;
c57390	the deep springs made it tall,
c57391	directing their streams all around its base
c57392	and sending their channels to all the trees of the field.
c57393	Therefore it towered higher than all the trees of the field.
c57394	Its branches multiplied,
c57395	and its boughs grew long ... because of the abundant waters.
c57396	as it spread them out
c57397	All the birds of the air nested in its branches,
c57398	and all the beasts of the field gave birth beneath its boughs;
c57399	all the great nations lived in its shade.
c57400	It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its limbs,
c57401	for its roots extended to abundant waters.
c57402	The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it;
c57403	the pine trees could not compare with its branches,
c57404	nor the plane trees match its boughs.
c57405	No tree in the garden of God could compare with its beauty.
c57406	I made it beautiful with its many branches,
c57407	the envy of all the trees of Eden,
c57408	which were in the garden of God.’
c57409	Therefore
c57410	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57411	‘Since it became great in height
c57412	and set its top among the clouds,
c57413	and it grew proud on account of its height,
c57414	I handed it over to the ruler of the nations,
c57415	for him to deal with it according to its wickedness.
c57416	I have banished it.
c57417	Foreigners, the most ruthless of the nations, cut it down
c57418	and left it.
c57419	Its branches have fallen on the mountains and in every valley;
c57420	its boughs lay broken in all the earth’s ravines.
c57421	And all the peoples of the earth left its shade
c57422	and abandoned it.
c57423	All the birds of the air nested on its fallen trunk,
c57424	and all the beasts of the field were among its boughs.
c57425	This happened so that no other trees by the waters would become great in height ... they have all
c57426	and set their tops among the clouds, ... no other ... to
c57427	and ... well-watered trees would reach them in height.
c57428	For ... been consigned to death, ... the depths of the earth, among the mortals who descend to the Pit.’
c57429	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c57430	‘On the day
c57431	it was brought down to Sheol,
c57432	I caused grief.
c57433	I covered the deep because of it;
c57434	I held back its rivers;
c57435	its abundant waters were restrained.
c57436	I made Lebanon mourn for it,
c57437	and all the trees of the field fainted because of it.
c57438	I made the nations quake at the sound of its downfall,
c57439	when I cast it down to Sheol with those who descend to the Pit.
c57440	Then all the trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, all the well-watered trees, were consoled in the earth below.
c57441	They too descended with it to Sheol, to those slain by the sword.
c57442	As its allies they had lived in its shade among the nations.
c57443	Who then is like you in glory and greatness among the trees of Eden? ... to
c57444	You also will be brought down ... the depths of the earth to be with the trees of Eden.
c57445	You will lie among the uncircumcised,
c57446	with those slain by the sword.
c57447	This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,
c57448	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c57449	In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day, ... came
c57450	the word of the LORD ... to me,
c57451	saying,
c57452	“Son of man,
c57453	take up a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt
c57454	and say to him:
c57455	a lion among the nations;
c57456	‘You are like
c57457	you are like a monster in the seas.
c57458	You thrash about in your rivers,
c57459	churning up the waters with your feet
c57460	and muddying the streams.’
c57461	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c57462	‘I will spread My net over you with a company of many peoples,
c57463	and they will draw you up in My net.
c57464	I will abandon you on the land
c57465	and hurl you into the open field.
c57466	I will cause all the birds of the air to settle upon you
c57467	and all the beasts of the earth to eat their fill of you.
c57468	I will put your flesh on the mountains
c57469	and fill the valleys with your remains.
c57470	I will drench the land with the flow
c57471	of your blood, all the way to the mountains—
c57472	the ravines will be filled.
c57473	I will cover
c57474	When I extinguish you, ... the heavens
c57475	and darken their stars.
c57476	I will cover the sun with a cloud,
c57477	and the moon will not give its light.
c57478	All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you,
c57479	and I will bring darkness upon your land,’
c57480	declares the Lord GOD.
c57481	‘I will trouble the hearts of many peoples,
c57482	when I bring about your destruction among the nations,
c57483	in countries
c57484	you do not know.
c57485	I will cause many peoples to be appalled over you,
c57486	and their kings will shudder with horror because of you
c57487	when I brandish My sword before them.
c57488	will tremble every moment
c57489	each of them ... for his life.’
c57490	On the day of your downfall
c57491	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57492	‘The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you!
c57493	I will make your hordes fall by the swords of the mighty,
c57494	the most ruthless of all nations.
c57495	They will ravage the pride of Egypt
c57496	and all her multitudes will be destroyed.
c57497	I will slaughter all her cattle beside the abundant waters.
c57498	No human foot will muddy them again,
c57499	and no cattle hooves will disturb them.
c57500	Then I will let her waters settle
c57501	and will make her rivers flow like oil,
c57502	declares the Lord GOD.
c57503	When I make the land of Egypt a desolation
c57504	and empty [it] of all that filled it,
c57505	when I strike down all
c57506	who live there,
c57507	then they will know
c57508	that I am the LORD.’
c57509	This ... they will chant for her;
c57510	is the lament
c57511	the daughters of the nations will chant it.
c57512	Over Egypt and all her multitudes they will chant it,
c57513	declares the Lord GOD.”
c57514	In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, ... came
c57515	the word of the LORD ... to me,
c57516	saying,
c57517	“Son of man,
c57518	wail for the multitudes of Egypt,
c57519	and consign to the depths of the earth both her and the daughters of the mighty nations, with those who descend to the Pit:
c57520	‘Whom do you surpass in beauty?
c57521	Go down
c57522	and be placed with the uncircumcised!
c57523	They will fall among those slain by the sword.
c57524	The sword is appointed!
c57525	They drag her away
c57526	along with all her multitudes.
c57527	Mighty chiefs will speak from the midst of Sheol about [Egypt] and her allies:
c57528	“They have come down
c57529	and lie with the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword.”
c57530	Assyria is there with her whole company;
c57531	her graves are all around her.
c57532	All of them are slain,
c57533	fallen by the sword.
c57534	Her graves are set in the depths of the Pit,
c57535	and her company is all around her grave.
c57536	All of them are slain,
c57537	fallen by the sword—
c57538	those who once spread terror in the land of the living.
c57539	Elam is there with all her multitudes around her grave.
c57540	All of them are slain,
c57541	fallen by the sword—
c57542	those who went down uncircumcised to the earth below,
c57543	who once spread their terror in the land of the living.
c57544	They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit.
c57545	Among the slain they prepare a resting place for Elam with all her hordes,
c57546	with her graves all around her.
c57547	All of them are uncircumcised,
c57548	slain by the sword,
c57549	although their terror was once spread in the land of the living.
c57550	They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit.
c57551	They are placed among the slain.
c57552	Meshech and Tubal are there with all their multitudes,
c57553	with their graves all around them.
c57554	All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword,
c57555	because they spread their terror in the land of the living.
c57556	They do not lie down with ... warriors
c57557	the fallen ... of old,
c57558	who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war,
c57559	whose swords were placed under their heads,
c57560	whose shields rested on their bones,
c57561	although the terror of the mighty was once in the land of the living.
c57562	But you too will be shattered ... among the uncircumcised,
c57563	and lie down ... with those slain by the sword.
c57564	Edom is there, and all her kings and princes,
c57565	who despite their might are laid among those slain by the sword.
c57566	They lie down with the uncircumcised,
c57567	with those who descend to the Pit.
c57568	All the leaders of the north and all the Sidonians are there;
c57569	they went down ... with the slain, despite the terror
c57570	in disgrace ... of their might.
c57571	They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword
c57572	and bear their shame with those who descend to the Pit.
c57573	Pharaoh will see them
c57574	and be comforted over all his multitude—
c57575	Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword,
c57576	declares the Lord GOD.
c57577	For I will spread My terror in the land of the living,
c57578	so that Pharaoh and all his multitude will be laid to rest among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword,
c57579	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c57580	Again the word of the LORD came to me,
c57581	saying,
c57582	“Son of man,
c57583	speak to your people
c57584	and tell them:
c57585	a land,
c57586	‘Suppose I bring the sword against
c57587	and the people of that land choose a man from among them,
c57588	appointing him as their watchman,
c57589	and he sees the sword
c57590	coming against that land
c57591	and blows his trumpet
c57592	to warn the people.
c57593	Then if anyone hears the sound of the trumpet
c57594	but fails to heed the warning,
c57595	and the sword comes
c57596	and takes him away,
c57597	his blood will be on his own head.
c57598	Since he heard the sound of the trumpet
c57599	but failed to heed the warning,
c57600	his blood will be on his own head.
c57601	If he had taken warning,
c57602	he would have saved his life.
c57603	the watchman
c57604	But if ... sees the sword
c57605	coming
c57606	and fails to blow the trumpet,
c57607	so that the people are not warned,
c57608	and the sword comes
c57609	and takes away a life,
c57610	then that one is taken away in his iniquity,
c57611	but I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.’
c57612	As for you,
c57613	O son of man,
c57614	I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel;
c57615	so hear the word from My mouth
c57616	and give them warning from Me.
c57617	If I say to the wicked,
c57618	‘O wicked [man],
c57619	you will surely die,’
c57620	but you do not speak out
c57621	to dissuade him from his way,
c57622	then that wicked [man] will die in his iniquity,
c57623	yet I will hold you accountable for his blood.
c57624	you
c57625	But if ... warn the wicked man ... from his way,
c57626	to turn
c57627	and he does not turn from it,
c57628	he will die in his iniquity,
c57629	but you will have saved your life.
c57630	Now as for you,
c57631	son of man,
c57632	tell the house of Israel
c57633	that this is what [they] have said:
c57635	‘Our transgressions and our sins are heavy upon us,
c57636	and we are wasting away because of them!
c57637	How can we live?’
c57638	Say to them:
c57639	‘As surely as I live,
c57640	declares the Lord GOD,
c57641	I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
c57642	but rather that the wicked should turn from their ways
c57643	and live.
c57644	Turn!
c57645	Turn from your evil ways!
c57646	For why should you die,
c57647	O house of Israel?’
c57648	Therefore,
c57649	son of man,
c57650	say to your people:
c57651	‘The righteousness of the righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression;
c57652	will the wickedness of the wicked man
c57653	neither ... cause him to stumble on the day
c57654	he turns from his wickedness.
c57655	Nor will the righteous man be able
c57656	to survive by his righteousness on the day
c57657	he sins.’
c57658	If I tell the righteous man
c57659	that he will surely live,
c57660	but he then trusts in his righteousness
c57661	and commits iniquity,
c57662	then none of his righteous works will be remembered;
c57663	because of the iniquity
c57664	he has committed.
c57665	he will die
c57667	So when I tell the wicked man,
c57668	‘You will surely die,’
c57669	and he turns from his sin
c57670	and does what is just and right—
c57671	if he restores a pledge,
c57672	makes restitution for what he has stolen,
c57673	and walks in the statutes of life
c57674	without practicing iniquity—
c57675	he will surely live;
c57676	he will not die.
c57677	None of the sins
c57678	he has committed
c57679	will be held against him.
c57680	He has done what is just and right;
c57681	he will surely live.
c57682	Yet your people say,
c57683	‘The way of the LORD is not just.’
c57684	But it is
c57685	their way that is not just.
c57686	If a righteous man turns from his righteousness
c57687	and commits iniquity,
c57688	he will die for it.
c57690	But if a wicked man turns from his wickedness
c57691	and does what is just and right,
c57692	he will live because of this.
c57693	Yet you say,
c57694	‘The way of the LORD is not just.’
c57695	each ... according to his ways,
c57696	But I will judge ... of you
c57697	O house of Israel.”
c57698	In the twelfth year of our exile, on the fifth day of the tenth month,
c57699	a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me
c57700	and reported,
c57701	“The city has been taken!”
c57702	Now the evening ... the hand of the LORD was upon me,
c57703	before the fugitive arrived,
c57704	and He opened my mouth
c57705	before the man came to me in the morning.
c57706	So my mouth was opened
c57707	and I was no longer mute.
c57708	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c57709	saying,
c57710	“Son of man,
c57711	those living in the ruins in the land of Israel are saying,
c57713	‘Abraham was only one man,
c57714	yet he possessed the land.
c57715	But we are many;
c57716	[surely] the land has been given to us as a possession.’
c57717	Therefore
c57718	tell them
c57719	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57720	‘You eat meat with the blood [in it],
c57721	lift up your eyes to your idols,
c57722	and shed blood.
c57723	Should you then possess the land?
c57724	You have relied on your swords,
c57725	you have committed detestable acts,
c57727	and each ... his neighbor’s wife.
c57728	of you has defiled
c57729	Should you then possess the land?’
c57730	Tell them that this
c57731	is what the Lord GOD says:
c57732	‘As surely as I live,
c57734	those in the ruins
c57735	will fall by the sword,
c57737	those in the open field
c57738	I will give ... by wild animals,
c57739	to be devoured
c57741	and those in the strongholds and caves
c57742	will die by plague.
c57743	I will make the land a desolate waste,
c57744	and the pride of her strength will come to an end.
c57745	The mountains of Israel will become desolate, so that no one will pass through.
c57746	Then they will know
c57747	that I am the LORD,
c57748	when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the abominations
c57749	they have committed.’
c57750	As for you,
c57751	son of man,
c57752	your people
c57753	are talking about you near the city walls and in the doorways of their houses.
c57754	One speaks ... another,
c57755	to ... each ... to his brother,
c57756	saying
c57757	‘Come
c57758	and hear
c57759	the message
c57760	that has come from the LORD!’
c57761	So My people come to you as usual,
c57762	sit before you,
c57763	and hear your words;
c57764	but they do not put them into practice.
c57765	Although they express love with their mouths,
c57766	their hearts pursue dishonest gain.
c57767	Indeed, you [are] to them like a singer of love songs with a beautiful voice,
c57768	who skillfully
c57769	plays an instrument.
c57770	They hear your words
c57771	but do not put them into practice.
c57772	So when it comes to pass—
c57773	and surely it will come—
c57774	then they will know
c57775	that a prophet has been among them.”
c57776	Then the word of the LORD came to me,
c57777	saying,
c57778	“Son of man,
c57779	prophesy against the shepherds of Israel.
c57780	Prophesy
c57781	and tell them ... the shepherds
c57782	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57783	‘Woe to the shepherds of Israel,
c57784	who only feed themselves!
c57785	Should not ... feed their flock?
c57786	You eat the fat,
c57787	wear the wool,
c57788	and butcher the fattened sheep,
c57789	but you do not feed the flock.
c57790	You have not strengthened the weak,
c57791	healed the sick,
c57792	bound up the injured,
c57793	brought back the strays,
c57794	or searched for the lost. Instead,
c57795	you have ruled them with violence and cruelty.
c57796	They were scattered for lack of a shepherd,
c57797	they became food for all the wild beasts.
c57798	and when they were scattered,
c57799	My flock went astray on all the mountains and every high hill.
c57800	They were scattered over the face of all the earth,
c57801	with no one to search
c57802	or seek for them.’
c57803	Therefore,
c57804	you shepherds,
c57805	hear the word of the LORD:
c57806	‘As surely as I live,
c57807	declares the Lord GOD,
c57809	because My flock ... and has become prey
c57810	lacks a shepherd ... [and] food for every wild beast,
c57811	and because My shepherds did not search for My flock
c57812	but fed themselves
c57813	[instead],
c57814	therefore,
c57815	you shepherds,
c57816	hear the word of the LORD!’
c57817	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c57818	‘Behold, I [am] against the shepherds,
c57819	and I will demand My flock from them
c57820	and remove them
c57821	from tending the flock,
c57822	so that they can no longer feed themselves.
c57823	For I will deliver My flock from their mouths,
c57824	and it will no longer be food for them.’
c57825	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57826	‘Behold,
c57827	I Myself
c57828	will search for My flock
c57829	and seek them out.
c57830	looks for
c57831	As a shepherd ... sheep
c57832	when
c57833	his scattered ... he is among the flock,
c57834	so I will look for My flock.
c57835	I will rescue them from all the places
c57836	to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.
c57837	I will bring them out from the peoples,
c57838	gather them from the countries,
c57839	and bring them into their own land.
c57840	I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the settlements of the land.
c57841	I will feed them in good pasture,
c57842	and the lofty mountains of Israel will be their grazing land.
c57843	There they will lie down in a good grazing land;
c57844	they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
c57845	I will tend My flock
c57846	and make them lie down,
c57847	declares the Lord GOD.
c57848	I will seek the lost,
c57849	bring back the strays,
c57850	bind up the broken,
c57851	and strengthen the weak;
c57852	but the sleek and strong I will destroy.
c57853	I will shepherd them with justice.’
c57854	to you,
c57855	My flock:
c57856	This is what the Lord GOD says
c57857	‘I will judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and the goats.
c57858	Is it not enough for
c57859	you to feed on the good pasture?
c57860	Must you also trample the rest of the pasture with your feet?
c57861	Is not it enough for you to drink the clear water?
c57862	Must you also muddy the rest with your feet?
c57863	Why must My flock feed on what your feet have trampled,
c57864	and drink what your feet have muddied?’
c57865	Therefore,
c57866	this is what the Lord GOD says to them:
c57867	‘Behold,
c57868	I Myself
c57869	will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
c57870	Since you shove with flank and shoulder,
c57871	and butt all the weak ones with your horns
c57872	until you scattered them abroad,
c57873	I will save My flock,
c57874	and they will no longer be prey.
c57875	I will judge between one sheep and another.
c57876	I will appoint over them one shepherd,
c57877	My servant David, and he will feed them.
c57878	He will feed them
c57879	and be their shepherd.
c57880	I, the LORD, will be their God,
c57881	and My servant David will be a prince among them.
c57882	I, the LORD, have spoken.’
c57883	‘I will make with them a covenant of peace
c57884	and rid the land of wild animals,
c57885	so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness
c57886	and sleep in the forest.
c57887	I will make them and the places all around My hill a blessing.
c57888	I will send down showers in their season—
c57889	showers of blessing.
c57890	The trees of the field will give their fruit,
c57891	and the land will yield its produce;
c57892	My flock will be secure in their land.
c57893	They will know
c57894	that I am the LORD,
c57895	when I have broken the bars of their yoke
c57896	and delivered them from the hands
c57897	that enslaved them.
c57898	They will no longer be prey for the nations,
c57899	and the beasts of the earth will not consume them.
c57900	They will dwell securely,
c57901	and no one will frighten them.
c57902	And I will raise up for them a garden of renown,
c57903	and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land
c57904	[or] bear the scorn of the nations.
c57905	Then they will know
c57906	that I, the LORD their God, am with them,
c57907	and that they, the house of Israel, are My people,
c57908	declares the Lord GOD.
c57909	You are My flock, the sheep of My pasture,
c57910	My people,
c57911	and I am your God,’
c57912	declares the Lord GOD.”
c57913	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me,
c57914	saying,
c57915	“Son of man,
c57916	turn your face toward Mount Seir
c57917	and prophesy against it,
c57918	and declare
c57919	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57920	‘Behold, I am against you,
c57921	O Mount Seir.
c57922	I will stretch out My hand against you
c57923	and make you a desolate waste.
c57924	I will turn your cities into ruins,
c57925	and you will become a desolation.
c57926	Then you will know
c57927	that I am the LORD.
c57928	Because you harbored an ancient hatred
c57929	and delivered the Israelites over to the sword in the time of their disaster, at the final stage of their punishment,
c57930	therefore,
c57931	as surely as I live,
c57932	declares the Lord GOD,
c57933	I will give you over to bloodshed
c57934	and [it] will pursue you.
c57935	Since you did not hate bloodshed,
c57936	it will pursue you.
c57937	I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste
c57938	and will cut off from it those who come and go.
c57939	I will fill its mountains with the slain;
c57940	on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines.
c57941	those killed by the sword will fall
c57942	I will make you a perpetual desolation,
c57943	and your cities will not be inhabited.
c57944	Then you will know
c57945	that I am the LORD.
c57946	Because you have said,
c57947	“These two nations and countries
c57948	will be ours,
c57949	and we will possess them,”
c57950	even though the LORD was there,
c57951	therefore,
c57952	as surely I live,
c57953	declares the Lord GOD,
c57954	I will treat you according to the anger and jealousy
c57955	you showed in your hatred against them,
c57956	and I will make Myself known among them
c57957	when I judge you.
c57958	Then you will know
c57959	that I, the LORD,
c57960	have heard every contemptuous word
c57961	you uttered against the mountains of Israel
c57962	when you said,
c57963	“They are desolate;
c57964	they are given to us to devour!”
c57965	You boasted against Me with your mouth
c57966	and multiplied your words against Me.
c57967	I heard it Myself!’
c57968	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c57969	‘While the whole earth rejoices,
c57970	I will make you desolate.
c57971	As you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel
c57972	became desolate,
c57973	so will I do to you:
c57974	you will become a desolation,
c57975	O Mount Seir, and so will all of Edom.
c57976	Then they will know
c57977	that I am the LORD.’
c57978	And you,
c57979	son of man,
c57980	prophesy to the mountains of Israel
c57981	and say,
c57982	‘O mountains of Israel,
c57983	hear the word of the LORD.
c57984	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c57985	Because the enemy has said of you,
c57986	“Aha!
c57987	The ancient heights have become our possession,”
c57988	therefore
c57989	prophesy
c57990	and declare
c57991	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c57992	Because
c57993	they have made you desolate
c57994	and have trampled you on every side,
c57995	so that you became a possession of the rest of the nations
c57996	and were taken up in slander by the lips of [their] talkers,
c57997	therefore,
c57998	O mountains of Israel,
c57999	hear the word of the Lord GOD.’
c58000	This is what the Lord GOD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, ... ruins
c58001	to the desolate
c58002	cities,
c58003	and abandoned
c58004	which have become plunder and a mockery to the rest of the nations
c58005	all around.
c58006	Therefore,
c58007	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58008	‘Surely in My burning zeal I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all of Edom,
c58009	who took My land as their own possession with wholehearted joy and with utter contempt,
c58010	so that its pastureland became plunder.’
c58011	Therefore,
c58012	prophesy concerning the land of Israel
c58013	and tell the mountains and hills, the ravines and valleys,
c58014	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58015	‘Behold, I have spoken in My burning zeal
c58016	because you have endured the reproach of the nations.’
c58017	Therefore
c58018	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58019	‘I have sworn with an uplifted hand
c58020	that surely the nations
c58021	all around you
c58022	will endure reproach of their own.
c58023	But you,
c58024	O mountains of Israel,
c58025	will produce branches
c58026	and bear fruit for My people Israel,
c58027	for they will soon
c58028	come home.
c58029	For behold, I am on your side;
c58030	I will turn toward you,
c58031	and you will be tilled
c58032	and sown.
c58033	I will multiply the people upon you with the whole house of Israel in its entirety.
c58034	The cities will be inhabited
c58035	and the ruins rebuilt.
c58036	I will fill you with people and animals,
c58037	and they will increase
c58038	and be fruitful.
c58039	I will make you inhabited as you once were,
c58040	and I will make you prosper more than before.
c58041	Then you will know
c58042	that I am the LORD.
c58043	Yes, {I will cause} My people Israel to walk upon you;
c58044	they will possess you,
c58045	and you will be their inheritance,
c58046	and you will no longer
c58047	deprive them [of their children].’
c58048	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58049	‘Because people say to you,
c58050	“You devour men
c58051	and deprive your nation of its children,”
c58052	therefore
c58053	you will no longer devour men
c58054	or deprive your nation {of its children},
c58055	declares the Lord GOD.
c58056	I will no longer allow the taunts of the nations to be heard against you,
c58057	and you will no longer endure the reproach of the peoples
c58058	[or] cause your nation to stumble,
c58059	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c58060	Again the word of the LORD came to me,
c58061	saying,
c58062	“Son of man,
c58063	when the people of Israel
c58064	lived in their land,
c58065	they defiled it by their own ways and deeds.
c58066	Their behavior before Me was like the uncleanness of a [woman] in her [monthly] impurity.
c58067	So I poured out My wrath upon them because of the blood
c58068	they had shed on the land,
c58069	and because they had defiled it with their idols.
c58070	I dispersed them among the nations,
c58071	and they were scattered throughout the lands.
c58072	I judged them according to their ways and their deeds.
c58073	among the nations
c58074	And wherever they went
c58075	they profaned My holy name,
c58076	because it was said of them
c58077	‘These are the people of the LORD,
c58078	yet they had to leave His land.’
c58079	But I had concern for My holy name,
c58080	which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations
c58081	to which they had gone.
c58082	Therefore,
c58083	tell the house of Israel
c58084	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58085	‘It is not for your sake that I will act,
c58086	O house of Israel,
c58087	but for My holy name,
c58088	which you profaned among the nations
c58089	to which you went.
c58090	I will show the holiness of My great name,
c58091	which has been profaned among the nations—
c58092	the name you have profaned among them.
c58093	Then the nations will know
c58094	that I am the LORD,
c58095	declares the Lord GOD,
c58096	when I show My holiness in you before their eyes.
c58097	For I will take you from among the nations
c58098	and gather you out of all the countries,
c58099	and I will bring you back into your own land.
c58100	I will also sprinkle clean water on you,
c58101	and you will be clean. ... from all your impurities
c58102	I will cleanse you ... and all your idols.
c58103	I will give you a new heart
c58104	and put a new spirit within you;
c58105	I will remove your heart of stone ... of flesh.
c58106	and give you a heart
c58107	And I will put My Spirit within you
c58108	and cause
c58109	you to walk in My statutes
c58110	and to carefully ... My ordinances.
c58111	observe
c58112	Then you will live in the land
c58113	that I gave your forefathers;
c58114	you will be My people,
c58115	and I will be your God.
c58116	I will save you from all your uncleanness.
c58117	I will summon the grain
c58118	and make it plentiful,
c58119	and I will not bring famine upon you.
c58120	I will also make the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field plentiful,
c58121	so that you will no longer bear reproach among the nations on account of famine.
c58122	Then you will remember your evil ways
c58123	and your deeds
c58124	that were not good,
c58125	and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and abominations.
c58126	It is not for your sake that I will act,
c58127	declares the Lord GOD—
c58128	let it be known to you.
c58129	Be ashamed
c58130	and disgraced for your own ways,
c58131	O house of Israel!’
c58132	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c58133	‘On the day
c58134	I cleanse you from all your iniquities,
c58135	I will cause the cities to be resettled
c58136	and the ruins to be rebuilt.
c58137	The desolate land will be cultivated
c58138	instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through.
c58139	Then they will say,
c58140	“This land
c58141	that was desolate
c58142	has become like the garden of Eden.
c58143	The cities that were once ruined, desolate, and destroyed are now fortified and inhabited.”
c58144	Then the nations ... will know
c58145	around you that remain
c58146	that I, the LORD, have rebuilt
c58147	what was destroyed,
c58148	and I have replanted
c58149	what was desolate.
c58150	I, the LORD, have spoken,
c58151	and I will do it.’
c58152	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c58153	‘Once again I will hear the plea of the house of Israel ... this:
c58154	and do for them
c58155	I will multiply their people like a flock.
c58156	Like the numerous flocks for sacrifices
c58157	at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts,
c58158	so the ruined cities will be filled with flocks of people.
c58159	Then they will know
c58160	that I am the LORD.’”
c58161	The hand of the LORD was upon me,
c58162	and He brought me out by His Spirit
c58163	and set me down in the middle of the valley;
c58164	it was full of bones.
c58165	He led me all around among them,
c58166	and I saw
c58167	a great many [bones] on the floor of the valley,
c58168	and indeed
c58169	they were very dry.
c58170	Then He asked me,
c58171	“Son of man,
c58172	can these bones live?”
c58173	I replied,
c58174	“O Lord GOD,”
c58175	“only You know.”
c58176	And He said to me,
c58177	“Prophesy concerning these bones
c58178	and tell them:
c58179	‘Dry bones,
c58180	hear the word of the LORD!
c58181	This is what the Lord GOD says to these bones:
c58182	I will cause breath to enter you,
c58183	and you will live.
c58184	I will attach tendons to you
c58185	and make flesh grow upon you
c58186	and cover you with skin.
c58187	I will put breath within you
c58188	so that you will come to life.
c58189	Then you will know
c58190	that I am the LORD.’”
c58191	So I prophesied
c58192	as I had been commanded.
c58193	there was ... a noise,
c58194	And as I prophesied,
c58195	suddenly
c58196	a rattling sound,
c58197	and the bones came together,
c58198	bone to bone.
c58199	As I looked on,
c58200	appeared
c58201	tendons ... on them,
c58202	flesh grew,
c58203	and skin covered them;
c58204	but there was no breath in them.
c58205	Then He said to me,
c58206	“Prophesy to the breath;
c58207	prophesy,
c58208	son of man,
c58209	and tell it
c58210	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58211	‘Come from the four ... O breath,
c58212	winds,
c58213	and breathe into these slain,
c58214	so that they may live!’”
c58215	So I prophesied
c58216	as He commanded me,
c58217	and the breath entered them,
c58218	and they came to life
c58219	and stood on their feet—
c58220	a vast army.
c58221	Then He said to me,
c58222	“Son of man,
c58223	these bones
c58224	are the whole house of Israel. ... they
c58225	Look, ... are saying,
c58226	‘Our bones are dried up,
c58227	and our hope has perished;
c58228	we are cut off.’
c58229	Therefore
c58230	prophesy
c58231	and tell them
c58232	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58233	‘O ... I will open your graves
c58234	and bring you up from them,
c58235	My people,
c58236	and I will bring you back to the land of Israel.
c58237	will know
c58238	that I am the LORD,
c58239	when I open your graves
c58240	and bring you up from them.
c58241	Then you, My people,
c58242	I will put My Spirit in you
c58243	and you will live,
c58244	and I will settle you in your own land.
c58245	Then you will know
c58246	that I, the LORD, have spoken,
c58247	and I will do it,
c58248	declares the LORD.’”
c58249	Again the word of the LORD came to me,
c58250	saying,
c58251	“And you,
c58252	son of man,
c58253	take a single stick
c58254	and write on it:
c58255	‘Belonging to Judah and to the Israelites associated with him.’
c58256	Then take another stick
c58257	and write on it:
c58258	‘Belonging to Joseph— the stick of Ephraim— and to all the house of Israel associated with him.’
c58259	Then join them together into one stick,
c58260	so that they become one in your hand.
c58262	When your people ask you,
c58264	‘Won't you explain to us
c58265	what you [mean] by these?’
c58266	you are to tell them
c58267	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58268	‘I will take the stick of Joseph,
c58269	which is in the hand of Ephraim,
c58270	and the tribes of Israel associated with him,
c58271	and I will put them together with the stick of Judah.
c58272	I will make them into a single stick,
c58273	and they will become one in My hand.’
c58274	When the sticks ... are
c58275	on which you write
c58276	in your hand and in full view of the people,
c58277	you are to tell them ... them into
c58278	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58279	‘I will take the Israelites out of the nations
c58280	to which they have gone,
c58281	and I will gather them from all around
c58282	and bring ... their own land.
c58283	I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel,
c58284	and one king will rule over all of them.
c58285	Then they will no ... be two nations
c58286	longer ... and will never again be divided into two kingdoms.
c58287	They will no longer defile themselves with their idols or detestable images, or with any of their transgressions.
c58288	I will deliver them from all their apostasies
c58289	by which they sinned,
c58290	and I will cleanse them.
c58291	Then they will be My people,
c58292	and I will be their God.
c58293	My servant David will be king over them,
c58294	and there will be one shepherd for all of them.
c58295	They will follow My ordinances
c58296	and keep ... My statutes.
c58297	and observe
c58298	They will live in the land
c58299	that I gave to My servant Jacob,
c58300	where your fathers lived.
c58301	They will live there forever with their children and grandchildren,
c58302	and My servant David will be their prince forever.
c58303	And I will make a covenant of peace with them;
c58304	it will be an everlasting covenant.
c58305	I will establish
c58306	and multiply them,
c58307	and I will set My sanctuary among them forever.
c58308	My dwelling place will be with them;
c58309	I will be their God,
c58310	and they will be My people.
c58311	Then the nations will know
c58312	that I the LORD sanctify Israel,
c58313	when My sanctuary is among them forever.’”
c58314	And the word of the LORD came to me,
c58315	saying,
c58316	“Son of man,
c58317	set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
c58318	Prophesy against him
c58319	and declare
c58320	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58321	‘Behold, I am against you,
c58322	O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
c58323	I will turn you around,
c58324	put hooks in your jaws,
c58325	and bring you out with all your army— your horses, your horsemen
c58326	in full armor,
c58327	a huge company armed with shields and bucklers,
c58328	all brandishing their swords.
c58329	Persia, Cush, and Put will accompany them,
c58330	all with shields and helmets;
c58331	Gomer with all its troops; and Beth-togarmah from the far north with all its troops—
c58332	many nations with you.
c58333	Get ready;
c58334	prepare yourself, you and all your company
c58335	gathered around you;
c58336	you will be their guard.
c58337	After a long time you will be summoned.
c58338	In the last years you will enter a land
c58339	brought back from war
c58340	and regathered from many peoples to the mountains of Israel,
c58341	which had long been desolate.
c58342	They had been brought out from the nations,
c58343	and all now dwell securely.
c58344	will go up,
c58345	advancing like a thunderstorm;
c58346	like a cloud
c58347	covering the land.’
c58348	you will be
c58349	You and all your troops,
c58350	and many peoples with you
c58351	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c58353	‘On that day, thoughts will arise in your mind,
c58354	and you will devise an evil plan.
c58355	You will say,
c58356	“I will go up against a land of unwalled villages;
c58357	I will come against a tranquil people who dwell securely,
c58358	all of them living without walls
c58359	[or] bars or gates—
c58360	in order to seize the spoil
c58361	and carry off the plunder,
c58362	to turn a hand against the desolate places now inhabited and against a people
c58363	gathered from the nations,
c58364	who have acquired livestock and possessions
c58365	and who live at the center of the land.”
c58366	Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its villages will ask you,
c58368	to capture spoil?
c58369	“Have you come
c58371	to carry off plunder,
c58372	Have you assembled your hordes
c58373	to make off with silver and gold,
c58374	to take cattle and goods,
c58375	to seize great spoil?”’
c58376	Therefore
c58377	prophesy,
c58378	son of man,
c58379	and tell Gog
c58380	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58381	‘On that day ... will you not
c58382	when My people Israel are dwelling securely,
c58383	take notice of this?
c58384	And you will come from your place out of the far north— you and many peoples with you,
c58385	all riding horses—
c58386	a mighty horde, a huge army.
c58387	You will advance against My people Israel like a cloud
c58388	covering the land.
c58389	It will happen in the last days,
c58390	that I will bring you against My land,
c58391	so that the nations may know Me
c58392	when I show Myself holy in you before their eyes.’
c58393	O Gog,
c58394	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c58395	‘Are you the one
c58396	of whom I have spoken in former days through My servants, the prophets of Israel,
c58397	who for years prophesied in those times
c58398	that I would bring you against them?
c58399	Now on that day, the day
c58400	when Gog comes against the land of Israel,
c58401	declares the Lord GOD,
c58402	My wrath will flare up.
c58403	In My zeal and fiery rage I proclaim
c58404	that on that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
c58405	The fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the beasts of the field, every creature ... the face ... will tremble
c58406	that crawls upon the ground,
c58407	and all mankind
c58408	on ... of the earth ... at My presence.
c58409	The mountains will be thrown down,
c58410	the cliffs will collapse,
c58411	and every wall will fall to the ground.
c58412	And I will summon a sword against Gog on all My mountains,
c58413	declares the Lord GOD,
c58414	and every man’s sword will be against his brother.
c58415	I will execute judgment ... with plague and bloodshed.
c58416	I will pour out torrents of rain, hailstones, fire, and brimstone on him and on his troops and on the many nations
c58417	upon him ... with him.
c58418	I will magnify
c58419	and sanctify Myself,
c58420	and will reveal Myself in the sight of many nations.
c58421	Then they will know
c58422	that I am the LORD.’
c58423	As for you,
c58424	O son of man,
c58425	prophesy against Gog
c58426	and tell him
c58427	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58428	‘Behold, I am against you,
c58429	O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
c58430	I will turn you around,
c58431	drive you along,
c58432	bring you up from the far north,
c58433	and send you against the mountains of Israel.
c58434	Then I will strike the bow from your left hand
c58435	and dash down the arrows from your right hand.
c58436	On the mountains of Israel you will fall— you and all your troops and the nations
c58437	with you.
c58438	I will give you as food to every kind of ravenous bird and wild beast.
c58439	You will fall in the open field,
c58440	for I have spoken,
c58441	declares the Lord GOD.
c58442	I will send fire against Magog and those who dwell securely in the coastlands,
c58443	and they will know
c58444	that I am the LORD.
c58445	So I will make My holy name known among My people Israel
c58446	and will no longer allow it to be profaned.
c58447	Then the nations will know
c58448	that I am the LORD,
c58449	the Holy One in Israel.
c58450	Yes, it is coming,
c58451	and it will surely happen,
c58452	declares the Lord GOD.
c58453	This is the day
c58454	of which I have spoken.
c58455	Then those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out,
c58456	kindle fires,
c58457	and burn the weapons— the bucklers and shields, the bows and arrows, the clubs and spears.
c58458	For seven years they will use them for fuel.
c58459	They will not gather wood from the countryside
c58460	or cut it from the forests,
c58461	for they will use the weapons for fuel.
c58462	They will loot those who looted them
c58463	and plunder those who plundered them,
c58464	declares the Lord GOD.
c58465	And on that day
c58466	I will give Gog ... place
c58467	a burial ... in Israel,
c58468	the Valley of the Travelers, east of the Sea.
c58469	It will block those who travel through,
c58470	because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there.
c58471	So it will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog.
c58472	the house of Israel will be burying them
c58473	For seven months ... in order to cleanse the land.
c58474	All the people of the land will bury them
c58475	and will be renowned for it on the day
c58476	I display My glory,
c58477	declares the Lord GOD.
c58478	And men will be employed to continually
c58479	pass through the land
c58480	by burying the invaders who remain on the ground.
c58481	to cleanse it
c58482	At the end of the seven months they will begin their search.
c58483	As they pass through the land,
c58484	anyone who sees a human bone
c58485	will set up a pillar next to it,
c58486	until the gravediggers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog.
c58487	(Even the city will be named Hamonah.)
c58488	And so they will cleanse the land.’
c58489	And as for you,
c58490	son of man,
c58491	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58492	‘Call out to every kind of bird and to every beast of the field:
c58493	Assemble
c58494	and come
c58495	together from all around to the sacrificial feast
c58496	that I am preparing for you,
c58497	a great feast on the mountains of Israel.
c58498	There you will eat flesh
c58499	and drink blood.
c58500	You will eat the flesh of the mighty
c58501	and drink the blood of the princes of the earth [as though they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls—
c58502	all the fattened animals of Bashan.
c58503	you will eat fat until you are gorged
c58504	At the sacrifice ... and drink blood until you are drunk.
c58505	I am preparing,
c58506	And at My table you will eat your fill of horses and riders, of mighty men and warriors of every kind,
c58507	declares the Lord GOD.’
c58508	‘I will display My glory among the nations,
c58509	and all the nations will see the judgment
c58510	that I execute
c58511	and the hand
c58512	that I lay upon them.
c58513	the house of Israel will know
c58514	From that day forward ... that I am the LORD their God.
c58515	And the nations will know
c58516	that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity,
c58517	because they were unfaithful to Me.
c58518	So I hid My face from them
c58519	and gave them into the hand of their enemies,
c58520	so that they all fell by the sword.
c58521	I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and transgressions,
c58522	and I hid My face from them.
c58523	Therefore
c58524	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58525	Now I will restore Jacob from captivity
c58526	and will have compassion on the whole house of Israel,
c58527	and I will be jealous for My holy name.
c58528	They will forget their disgrace and all ... they committed against Me,
c58529	the treachery
c58530	when they dwell securely in their land,
c58531	with no one to frighten them.
c58532	When I bring them back from the peoples
c58533	and gather them out of the lands of their enemies,
c58534	I will show My holiness in them in the sight of many nations.
c58535	Then they will know
c58536	that I am the LORD their God,
c58537	after exiling them among the nations,
c58538	when I regather them to their own land,
c58539	not leaving any of them behind.
c58540	And I will no longer hide My face from them,
c58541	for I will pour out My Spirit on the house of Israel,’
c58542	declares the Lord GOD.”
c58543	In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month— in the fourteenth year
c58544	after Jerusalem had been struck down—
c58545	on that very day the hand of the LORD was upon me,
c58546	and He took me there.
c58547	In visions of God He took me to the land of Israel
c58548	and set me on a very high mountain,
c58549	on whose southern slope was a structure that resembled a city.
c58550	So He took me there,
c58551	and I saw a man
c58552	whose appearance was like bronze.
c58553	with a linen cord ... in his hand.
c58554	and a measuring rod
c58555	He was standing in the gateway
c58556	he said to me,
c58557	“Son of man,”
c58558	“look with your eyes,
c58559	hear with your ears,
c58560	and pay attention to everything
c58561	I am going to show you,
c58562	for
c58563	that [is why]
c58564	you have been brought here.
c58565	Report everything
c58566	you see
c58567	to the house of Israel.”
c58568	And I saw
c58569	a wall surrounding the temple area.
c58570	Now the length of the measuring rod in the man’s hand [was] six [long] cubits
c58571	([each measuring a] cubit and a handbreadth),
c58572	and he measured the [wall to be] ... thick
c58573	one rod
c58574	high.
c58575	[and] one rod
c58576	Then he came to the gate
c58577	facing east
c58578	and climbed its steps.
c58579	He measured the threshold of the gate [to be]
c58580	one rod deep.
c58583	Each gate chamber
c58584	[was] one rod long
c58585	and one [rod] wide,
c58586	and [there were] five cubits between the gate chambers.
c58587	The inner threshold of the gate by the portico facing inward [was] one rod [deep].
c58588	Then he measured the portico of the gateway inside;
c58590	[it was]
c58591	eight cubits [deep]
c58592	and its jambs [were]
c58593	two cubits [thick].
c58594	And the portico of the gateway faced [the temple].
c58595	gate chambers ... of the east gate,
c58596	There were three ... on each side
c58598	each with the same measurements,
c58599	and the gateposts on either side also had the same measurements.
c58600	And he measured the width of the gateway entrance
c58601	[to be] ten cubits,
c58602	and its length
c58603	[was] thirteen cubits.
c58604	In front of each gate chamber was a wall one cubit [high],
c58605	cubits
c58606	and the gate chambers [were] six
c58607	square.
c58608	Then he measured the gateway from the roof of a gate chamber to the roof
c58609	of the opposite one; [the distance was] twenty-five cubits
c58610	from doorway to doorway.
c58611	Next he measured the gateposts
c58612	[to be] sixty cubits [high].
c58613	The gateway [extended] around to the gatepost of the courtyard.
c58614	And the distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of [its] inner portico [was] fifty cubits.
c58615	The gate chambers and their side pillars had beveled windows
c58616	all around the inside of the gateway.
c58617	The porticos
c58618	also had windows all around on the inside.
c58619	Each side pillar was decorated with palm trees.
c58620	Then he brought me into the outer court,
c58621	and there were chambers
c58622	and a pavement laid out all around the court.
c58623	Thirty chambers faced the pavement,
c58624	which flanked the gateways and corresponded to the length of the gates; ... pavement.
c58625	this was the lower
c58626	Then he measured the distance from the front of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court;
c58627	it was a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north.
c58628	of the gateway
c58629	facing north.
c58630	of the outer court
c58631	He also measured the length and width
c58632	Its three gate chambers on each side,
c58634	its side pillars, and its portico all had the same measurements as the first gate:
c58635	fifty cubits long
c58636	and twenty-five cubits wide.
c58637	Its windows, portico, and palm trees had the same measurements as those of the gate
c58638	facing east.
c58639	Seven steps led up to it,
c58640	with its portico opposite them.
c58641	There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east.
c58642	He measured the distance from gateway to gateway
c58643	[to be] a hundred cubits.
c58644	Then he led me to the south side,
c58645	and I saw a gateway facing south.
c58646	He measured its side pillars and portico, and they had the same measurements as the others.
c58647	Both the gateway and its portico had windows all around, like the other windows.
c58648	[It was] fifty cubits long
c58649	and twenty-five cubits wide.
c58650	Seven steps led up to it,
c58651	and its portico was opposite them;
c58652	it had palm trees
c58653	one on each side.
c58655	on its side pillars,
c58656	The inner court also had a gate facing south,
c58657	and he measured [the distance] from gateway to gateway toward the south
c58658	[to be] a hundred cubits.
c58659	Next he brought me into the inner court through the south gate,
c58660	and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others.
c58661	Its gate chambers, side pillars, and portico had the same measurements as the others.
c58662	Both the gateway and its portico had windows all around;
c58663	it [was] fifty cubits long
c58664	and twenty-five cubits wide.
c58665	(There were porticoes all around,
c58666	twenty-five cubits long
c58667	and five cubits wide.)
c58668	Its portico faced the outer court,
c58669	and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees.
c58670	Eight steps led up to it.
c58671	And he brought me to the inner court on the east side,
c58672	and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others.
c58673	Its gate chambers, side pillars, and portico had the same measurements as the others.
c58674	Both [the gateway] and its portico had windows all around.
c58675	It [was] fifty cubits long
c58676	and twenty-five cubits wide.
c58677	Its portico faced the outer court,
c58678	and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees on each side.
c58679	Eight steps led up to it.
c58680	Then he brought me to the north gate
c58681	and measured [it]. It had the same measurements as the others,
c58682	as did its gate chambers, side pillars, and portico.
c58683	It also had windows all around.
c58684	[It was] fifty cubits long
c58685	twenty-five cubits wide.
c58686	Its portico faced the outer court,
c58687	and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees on each side.
c58688	Eight steps led up to it.
c58689	There was a chamber
c58690	with a doorway by the portico in each of the inner gateways.
c58691	There the burnt offering was to be washed.
c58692	Inside the portico of the gateway [were] two tables on each side,
c58694	on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were to be slaughtered.
c58695	Outside, as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, there were two tables on one side
c58696	on the other side
c58697	of the gate’s portico.
c58698	and two more tables
c58699	So there were four tables ... outside—
c58700	inside the gateway and four ... tables
c58701	eight
c58702	in all— on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered.
c58703	There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offering,
c58704	each a cubit and a half long,
c58705	a cubit and a half wide,
c58706	and a cubit high.
c58707	On these
c58708	were placed the utensils
c58709	used to slaughter the burnt offerings
c58710	and other sacrifices.
c58711	The double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth [long], were fastened all around the inside of the room,
c58712	and the flesh of the offering was to be placed on the tables.
c58713	Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two chambers, one
c58714	beside the north gate
c58715	and facing south,
c58716	and another beside the south gate and facing north.
c58717	Then the man said to me:
c58718	“The chamber
c58719	that faces south
c58720	is for the priests who have charge of the temple,
c58721	and the chamber
c58722	that faces north
c58723	is for the priests who have charge of the altar.
c58724	These are the sons of Zadok,
c58725	the [only] Levites who may approach the LORD
c58726	to minister before Him.”
c58727	Next he measured the court.
c58728	a hundred cubits long
c58729	and a hundred cubits wide.
c58730	It was square,
c58731	And the altar [was] in front of the temple.
c58732	Then he brought me to the portico of the temple
c58733	and measured the side pillars of the portico
c58734	[to be] five cubits on each
c58735	side. ... cubits
c58736	The width of the gateway was fourteen cubits and its sidewalls were three ... on either side.
c58738	The portico [was] twenty cubits wide
c58739	and twelve cubits deep,
c58740	and [ten] steps
c58741	led up to it.
c58742	There were columns by the side pillars,
c58743	one on each side.
c58745	Next he brought me into the outer sanctuary
c58746	and measured the side pillars
c58747	[to be] six cubits wide on each side.
c58750	The width of the entrance [was] ten cubits,
c58751	and the sides of the entrance [were] five cubits on each
c58752	side. ... cubits,
c58753	He also measured the length [of the outer sanctuary]
c58754	[to be] forty ... cubits.
c58755	and the width
c58756	twenty
c58757	Then he went into [the inner sanctuary]
c58758	and measured the side pillars at the entrance
c58759	[to be] two cubits [wide].
c58760	The entrance
c58761	[was] six cubits [wide],
c58762	[and the walls on each side] ... wide.
c58763	[were] seven cubits
c58764	Then he measured ... long
c58765	[to be] twenty cubits
c58766	wide.
c58767	the room adjacent to the inner sanctuary ... [and] twenty cubits
c58768	And he said to me,
c58769	“This is the Most Holy Place.”
c58770	Next he measured the wall of the temple
c58771	[to be] six cubits [thick],
c58772	and the width ... side room
c58773	of each ... around the temple [was] four cubits.
c58774	The side rooms were arranged one above another in three levels
c58775	of thirty rooms each.
c58776	There were ledges ... the wall
c58777	of the temple
c58778	all around ... for the side rooms,
c58779	to serve as supports
c58780	so that the supports would not be [fastened] into the wall of the temple itself.
c58781	widened at each successive level,
c58782	The side rooms
c58783	surrounding the temple ... because the structure surrounding the temple ascended by stages
c58784	corresponding to the narrowing of the temple wall as it rose upward.
c58785	And so a stairway went up from the lowest story to the highest through the middle one.
c58786	I saw that the temple had a raised base all it around forming the foundation for the side rooms.
c58787	It was the full length of a rod, six long cubits.
c58788	wall ... thick,
c58789	The outer ... of the side rooms
c58790	[was] five cubits
c58791	and the open area between the side rooms
c58792	of the temple
c58793	and the outer chambers [was] twenty cubits wide all around the temple.
c58794	The side rooms opened into this area, ... entrance
c58795	with one ... on the north
c58796	and another on the south.
c58797	The open area [was] five cubits wide all around.
c58798	Now the building
c58799	that faced the temple courtyard on the west
c58800	[was] seventy cubits wide,
c58801	and the wall of the building [was] five cubits thick all around
c58802	and a length of ninety cubits.
c58803	Then the man measured the temple
c58804	[to be] a hundred cubits long,
c58805	and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls
c58806	[were] also a hundred cubits long.
c58807	The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, [was] a hundred cubits.
c58808	Next he measured the length of the building facing the temple courtyard
c58809	at the rear [of the temple],
c58810	including its galleries on each side;
c58811	it was a hundred cubits.
c58812	The outer sanctuary, the inner sanctuary, and the porticoes facing the court,
c58813	as well as the thresholds and the beveled windows and the balconies all around with their three
c58814	levels opposite the threshold, were overlaid with wood on all sides.
c58815	They were paneled from the ground to the windows,
c58816	and the windows were covered.
c58817	In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary on the all the walls, ... around
c58818	spaced evenly ... the inner and outer sanctuary,
c58819	carved cherubim and palm trees.
c58820	were alternating ... Each cherub
c58821	had two faces:
c58822	the face of a man [was] toward the palm tree on one side,
c58823	and the face of a young lion [was] toward the palm tree on the other side.
c58824	They were carved all the way around the temple.
c58825	Cherubim and palm trees were carved ... from the floor to the space above the entrance.
c58826	on the wall of the outer sanctuary
c58827	The outer sanctuary had a rectangular doorframe,
c58828	and the [doorframe] of the sanctuary was similar.
c58829	There was an altar of wood
c58830	three cubits high
c58831	and two cubits square.
c58832	It had corners,
c58833	a base, and sides of wood.
c58834	And the man told me,
c58835	“This is the table
c58836	that is before the LORD.”
c58837	Both the outer sanctuary and the sanctuary had double doors,
c58838	and each door ... panels.
c58839	had two swinging
c58840	There were two panels for one door
c58841	and two for the other.
c58842	Cherubim and palm trees ... were carved on the doors of the outer sanctuary, ... on
c58843	like those on the walls
c58844	and there was a wooden canopy outside, ... the front of the portico.
c58845	There were beveled windows and palm trees on the side walls of the portico. The side rooms of the temple also had canopies.
c58846	Then the man led me out ... into the outer court,
c58847	northward
c58848	and he brought me to the group of chambers
c58849	opposite the temple courtyard
c58850	and the [outer wall] on the north side.
c58851	The building with the door facing north [was] a hundred cubits
c58852	long [and] fifty cubits wide.
c58853	opposite the twenty [cubits]
c58854	that belonged to the inner court
c58855	and opposite the pavement
c58856	that belonged to the outer court.
c58857	Gallery faced gallery in three levels,
c58858	In front of the chambers [was] an inner walkway ten cubits wide
c58859	and a [hundred] cubits long.
c58860	Their doors were on the north.
c58861	Now the upper chambers [were] smaller
c58862	because the galleries took more space from the chambers on the lower and middle floors of the building.
c58863	For they were arranged in three stories
c58864	and had no pillars like those of the courts;
c58865	so the upper chambers were set back further than the lower and middle floors.
c58866	A wall
c58867	on the outside ran in front of the chambers, parallel to them, toward the outer court,
c58868	for fifty cubits.
c58869	For the chambers ... long,
c58870	on the outer court
c58871	[were] fifty cubits
c58872	while those facing the temple [were] a hundred cubits [long].
c58873	And below these chambers [was] the entrance on the east side
c58874	as one enters them from the outer court.
c58875	On the south side along the length of the wall of the outer court [were] chambers, adjoining the courtyard and opposite the building,
c58876	with a passageway in front of them, just like the chambers
c58877	that were on the north.
c58878	They had the same length
c58879	and width,
c58880	as well as all their exits,
c58881	measurements, and entrances.
c58882	And corresponding to the doors of the chambers
c58883	that [were] facing south,
c58884	[there] [was] a door in front of the walkway
c58885	that was parallel to the wall extending eastward.
c58887	Then the man said to me,
c58888	“The north [and] south chambers
c58889	facing the temple courtyard
c58890	are the holy chambers
c58891	where the priests ... will eat
c58892	who approach the LORD
c58893	the most holy offerings.
c58894	There they will place the most holy offerings— the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings—
c58895	for the place is holy.
c58896	Once the priests have entered
c58897	the holy area, they must not go out into the outer court
c58898	until they have left behind the garments
c58899	in which they minister, ... that are
c58900	for these are holy.
c58901	They are to put on other clothes
c58902	before they approach
c58903	the places ... for the people.”
c58904	Now when [the man] had finished measuring the interior of the temple area,
c58905	he led me out by the gate
c58906	that faced east,
c58907	and he measured [the area] all around:
c58908	With a measuring rod he measured the east side
c58909	[to be] five hundred cubits [long].
c58910	He measured the north side
c58911	[to be] five hundred cubits [long].
c58912	He measured the south side
c58913	[to be] five hundred cubits [long].
c58914	And he came around ... the west side
c58915	and measured ... [to be] five hundred cubits [long].
c58916	So he measured the area on all four sides.
c58917	It had a wall all around,
c58918	five hundred [cubits] long
c58919	and five hundred [cubits] wide,
c58920	to separate the holy from the common.
c58921	Then the man brought me back to the gate
c58923	that faces east,
c58924	and I saw
c58925	the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east.
c58926	His voice was like the roar of many waters,
c58927	and the earth shone with His glory.
c58928	The vision ... was like the one
c58929	I saw
c58930	and like the ones
c58931	I had seen
c58932	when He came
c58933	to destroy the city,
c58935	I had seen by the River Kebar.
c58936	I fell facedown,
c58937	and the glory of the LORD entered the temple through the gate
c58938	facing east.
c58939	Then the Spirit lifted me up
c58940	and brought me into the inner court,
c58942	and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
c58943	I heard
c58944	someone speaking to me from inside the temple,
c58945	While the man was standing beside me,
c58946	and He said to me,
c58947	“Son of man,
c58948	this is the place of My throne and the place for the soles of My feet,
c58949	where I will dwell among the Israelites forever.
c58950	The house of Israel will never again defile My holy name— neither they nor their kings— by their prostitution and by the funeral offerings for their kings at their deaths.
c58951	When they placed their threshold next to My threshold
c58952	and their doorposts beside My doorposts,
c58953	with only a wall between Me and them,
c58954	they defiled My holy name by the abominations
c58955	they committed.
c58956	Therefore I have consumed them in My anger.
c58957	Now let them remove far from Me their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings,
c58958	and I will dwell among them forever.
c58959	As for you,
c58960	son of man,
c58961	describe the temple to the [people] of Israel,
c58962	so that they may be ashamed of their iniquities.
c58963	Let them measure the plan,
c58964	and if they are ashamed of all
c58965	they have done,
c58966	then make known to them the design of the temple— its arrangement and its exits and entrances— its whole design along with all its statutes, forms, and laws. ... and all
c58967	Write it down in their sight,
c58968	so that they may observe its complete design ... its statutes,
c58969	and may carry them out.
c58970	This is the law of the temple:
c58971	All its surrounding territory on top of the mountain will be most holy.
c58972	Yes, this is the law of the temple.
c58973	These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits
c58974	(a cubit and a handbreadth):
c58975	Its gutter [shall be] a cubit deep
c58976	and a cubit wide,
c58977	with a rim of one span around its edge.
c58978	And this [is] the height of the altar:
c58979	The space from the gutter on the ground to the lower ledge [shall be] two cubits [high]
c58980	and one cubit wide,
c58981	and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge [shall be] four cubits high
c58982	and one cubit wide.
c58983	The altar hearth [shall be] four cubits [high],
c58984	and four horns shall project upward from the hearth.
c58985	The altar [hearth] [shall be]
c58986	twelve [cubits] long [and] twelve [cubits] wide.
c58987	square at its four corners,
c58988	The ledge
c58989	[shall also be] square, fourteen [cubits] long and fourteen [cubits] wide,
c58990	with a rim of half a cubit ... all around it.
c58991	and a gutter of a cubit
c58992	The steps of the altar [shall] face east.”
c58993	Then He said to me:
c58994	“Son of man,
c58995	this is what the Lord GOD says:
c58996	‘These are the statutes for the altar
c58997	on the day
c58998	it is constructed,
c58999	so that burnt offerings may be sacrificed on it
c59000	and blood may be sprinkled on it:
c59001	You are to give ... to the Levitical priests
c59002	who are of the family of Zadok,
c59003	who approach Me
c59004	declares the Lord GOD.
c59005	to minister before Me,
c59006	a young bull from the herd as a sin offering
c59007	You are to take some of its blood
c59008	and put [it] on the four horns of the [altar], on the four corners of the ledge, and all around the rim;
c59009	thus you will cleanse
c59010	the altar and make atonement for it.
c59011	Then you are to take away the bull for the sin offering
c59012	and burn it in the appointed part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.
c59013	On the second day you are to present an unblemished male goat as a sin offering,
c59014	and the altar is to be cleansed
c59015	as it was with the bull.
c59016	When you have finished
c59017	the purification,
c59018	you are to present a young, unblemished bull and an unblemished ram from the flock.
c59019	You must present them before the LORD;
c59020	the priests are to sprinkle salt on them
c59021	and sacrifice them [as] a burnt offering to the LORD.
c59022	For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering;
c59023	you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both unblemished.
c59024	For seven days the priests are to make atonement for the altar
c59025	and cleanse it;
c59026	so they shall consecrate it.
c59027	At the end of these days,
c59028	from the eighth day on,
c59029	the priests are to present your burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar.
c59030	Then I will accept you,
c59031	declares the Lord GOD.’”
c59032	The man then brought me back to outer gate of the sanctuary
c59033	that faced east,
c59034	but it was shut.
c59035	And the LORD said to me,
c59036	“This gate is to remain shut.
c59037	It shall not be opened,
c59038	and no man shall enter through it,
c59039	because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it.
c59040	Therefore it will remain shut.
c59041	Only the prince
c59042	himself may sit inside the gateway
c59043	to eat in the presence of the LORD.
c59044	He must enter by way of the portico of the gateway
c59045	and go out the same way.”
c59046	Then the man brought me to the front of the temple by way of the north gate.
c59047	I looked
c59048	and saw
c59049	the glory of the LORD filling His temple,
c59050	and I fell facedown.
c59051	The LORD said to me:
c59052	“Son of man,
c59053	pay attention;
c59054	look carefully with your eyes
c59055	and listen closely with your ears to everything
c59056	I tell you concerning all the statutes and laws of the house of the LORD.
c59057	Take careful note of the entrance of the temple, along with all the exits of the sanctuary.
c59058	Tell the rebellious house of Israel
c59059	that this is what the Lord GOD says:
c59060	‘I have had enough of all your abominations,
c59061	O house of Israel.
c59062	you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in both heart and flesh,
c59063	to occupy My sanctuary;
c59064	you defiled My temple
c59065	when you offered My food— the fat and the blood;
c59066	In addition to all your other abominations, ... you broke My covenant.
c59067	And you have not kept charge of My holy things,
c59068	but have appointed others to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.’
c59069	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c59070	‘No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and flesh may enter My sanctuary—
c59071	not even a foreigner
c59072	who lives among the Israelites.
c59073	Surely the Levites
c59074	who wandered away from Me
c59075	when Israel went astray,
c59076	and who wandered away from Me after their idols,
c59077	will bear the consequences of their iniquity.
c59078	Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, [having] charge of the gates of the temple
c59079	and ministering [there].
c59080	They shall slaughter the burnt offerings and other sacrifices for the people
c59081	and stand before them
c59082	to minister to them.
c59083	Because they ministered before their idols
c59084	and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel,
c59085	therefore I swore with an uplifted hand concerning them
c59086	declares the Lord GOD.
c59087	that they would bear the consequences of their iniquity,
c59088	They must not approach Me
c59089	to serve Me as priests
c59090	or come near any of My holy things or the most holy things.
c59091	They will bear the shame of the abominations
c59092	they have committed.
c59093	Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of all the work for the temple and everything
c59094	to be done in it.
c59095	But the Levitical priests, who are descended from Zadok
c59096	and who kept charge of My sanctuary
c59097	when the Israelites went astray from Me,
c59098	are to approach Me
c59099	to minister before Me.
c59100	They will stand before Me
c59101	to offer Me fat and blood,
c59102	declares the Lord GOD.
c59103	They alone shall enter My sanctuary
c59104	and draw near to My table
c59105	to minister before Me.
c59106	They will keep My charge.
c59108	When they enter the gates of the inner court,
c59109	they are to wear linen garments;
c59110	they must not wear anything made of wool
c59111	when they minister at the gates of the inner court or inside [the temple].
c59112	They are to wear linen turbans on their heads
c59113	and linen undergarments around their waists.
c59114	They must not wear anything that makes them perspire.
c59115	When they go out to the outer court, to the people,
c59116	they are to take off the garments
c59117	in which they have ministered,
c59118	leave them in the holy chambers,
c59119	and dress in other clothes
c59120	so that they do not transmit holiness to the people with their garments.
c59121	They must not shave their heads
c59122	or let their hair grow long,
c59123	but must carefully trim their hair.
c59124	No priest may drink wine
c59125	before he enters the inner court.
c59126	And they shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman,
c59127	a virgin of the descendants of the house of Israel,
c59128	or a widow of a priest.
c59129	but must marry
c59130	They are to teach My people the difference between the holy and the common,
c59131	and show them how to discern between the clean and the unclean.
c59132	In any dispute, they shall officiate as judges
c59133	[and] judge according to My ordinances.
c59134	They must observe My laws and statutes regarding all My appointed feasts,
c59135	and they must keep My Sabbaths holy.
c59136	A priest must not ... by going near a dead person.
c59137	defile himself
c59138	However, for a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, ... sister,
c59139	or an unmarried
c59140	he may do so,
c59141	and after he is cleansed, he must count off seven days for himself.
c59142	And on the day
c59143	he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court,
c59144	to minister in the sanctuary,
c59145	he must present his sin offering,
c59146	declares the Lord GOD.
c59147	In regard to their inheritance,
c59148	I am their inheritance.
c59149	You are to give them no possession in Israel,
c59150	for I [am] their possession.
c59151	the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings.
c59152	They shall eat
c59153	Everything in Israel devoted to the LORD will belong to them.
c59154	The best of all the firstfruits and of every contribution from all your offerings will belong to the priests.
c59155	You are to give your first batch of dough to the priest,
c59156	so that a blessing may rest upon your homes.
c59157	The priests may not eat any bird or animal found dead or torn [by] [wild] [beasts].
c59159	When you divide the land by lot as an inheritance,
c59160	you are to set aside a portion for the LORD, a holy portion of the land
c59161	25,000[cubits] long
c59162	and 20,000 cubits wide.
c59163	This entire tract of land will be holy.
c59164	Within this area there is to be a section for the sanctuary 500[cubits]
c59165	square,
c59166	with 50 cubits
c59167	around it for open land.
c59168	From this holy portion, you are to measure off a length of 25,000 [cubits] and a width of 10,000 [cubits],
c59169	and in it will be the sanctuary, the Most Holy [Place].
c59170	a holy portion of the land
c59171	It will be ... to be used by the priests who minister in the sanctuary,
c59172	who draw near
c59173	to minister before the LORD.
c59174	It will be a place for their houses, as well as a holy area for the sanctuary.
c59175	[An adjacent area] 25,000 [cubits] long and 10,000 [cubits] wide
c59176	shall belong to the Levites who minister in the temple;
c59177	it will be their possession
c59178	for towns in which to live.
c59179	As the property of the city, you are to set aside [an area] 5,000 [cubits] wide and 25,000 [cubits] long, adjacent to the holy district.
c59180	It will belong to the whole house of Israel.
c59181	And the prince
c59182	will have the area bordering each side of the area formed by the holy district and the property of the city, extending westward from the western side and eastward from the eastern side,
c59183	running lengthwise from the western boundary to the eastern boundary and parallel to one of the [tribal] portions.
c59184	This land will be his
c59185	possession in Israel.
c59186	And My princes will no longer oppress My people,
c59187	but will give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
c59188	For this is what the Lord GOD says:
c59189	‘Enough,
c59190	O princes of Israel!
c59191	Cease your violence and oppression,
c59192	and do what is just and right.
c59193	Stop dispossessing My people,
c59194	declares the Lord GOD.’
c59195	You must use honest scales, a just ephah, and a just bath.
c59196	The ephah and the bath shall be the same quantity
c59197	so that the bath will contain a tenth of a homer,
c59198	and the ephah a tenth of a homer;
c59199	the homer will be the standard measure [for both].
c59200	The shekel will consist of twenty gerahs.
c59201	Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels will equal one mina.
c59202	This is the contribution
c59203	you are to offer:
c59204	a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat,
c59205	and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley.
c59206	The prescribed portion of oil, measured by the bath,
c59207	[is] a tenth of a bath from each cor
c59208	(which is ten baths [or] one homer;
c59209	for ten baths equal one homer).
c59210	And one sheep shall be given from [each] flock of two hundred from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These are for the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings,
c59211	to make atonement for the people,
c59212	declares the Lord GOD.
c59213	All the people of the land must participate in this contribution for the prince in Israel.
c59214	And it shall be the prince's [part] [to provide] the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings for the festivals, New Moons, and Sabbaths— for all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel.
c59215	He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings
c59216	to make atonement for the house of Israel.
c59217	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c59218	‘On the first day of the first month you are to take a young bull without blemish
c59219	and purify the sanctuary.
c59220	And the priest is to take some of the blood from the sin offering
c59221	and put [it] on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the inner court.
c59222	You must do the same thing on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins unintentionally or in ignorance.
c59223	In this way you will make atonement for the temple.
c59224	On the fourteenth day of the first month you are to observe the Passover,
c59225	a feast of seven days,
c59226	during which unleavened bread shall be eaten.
c59227	On that day the prince shall provide a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land.
c59228	during the seven days of the feast, he shall provide seven bulls and seven rams without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD,
c59229	Each day ... along with a male goat for a sin offering.
c59230	He shall also provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull and an ephah for each ram,
c59231	along with a hin of oil of for each ephah.
c59232	During the seven days of the feast that begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he is to make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, and oil.’
c59233	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c59234	‘The gate of the inner court
c59235	that faces east
c59236	must be kept shut during the six days of work,
c59237	but on the Sabbath day ... it shall be opened.
c59238	[and] on the day of the New Moon
c59239	The prince is to enter from the outside through the portico of the gateway
c59240	and stand by the gatepost,
c59241	while the priests sacrifice his burnt offerings and peace offerings.
c59242	He is to bow in worship at the threshold of the gate
c59243	and then depart,
c59244	but the gate must not be shut until evening.
c59245	On the Sabbaths and New Moons the people of the land are also to bow in worship before the LORD at the entrance to that gateway.
c59246	The burnt offering
c59247	that the prince presents to the LORD
c59248	on the Sabbath day [shall] [be] six unblemished male lambs and an unblemished ram.
c59249	The grain offering with the ram [shall] [be] [one] ephah,
c59250	and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able,
c59251	along with a hin of oil per ephah.
c59252	On the day of the New Moon [he shall offer] a young, unblemished bull, six lambs, and a ram without blemish.
c59253	He is to provide a grain offering of an ephah with the bull, an ephah with the ram,
c59254	with the lambs,
c59255	and as much as he is able
c59256	along with a hin of oil per ephah.
c59258	When the prince enters,
c59259	he shall go in through the portico of the gateway,
c59260	and he shall go out the same way.
c59262	When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts,
c59263	whoever enters by the north gate
c59264	to worship
c59265	must go out by the south gate,
c59267	and whoever enters by the south gate
c59268	must go out by the north gate.
c59269	No one is to return through the gate
c59270	by which he entered,
c59271	but each must go out by the opposite gate.
c59272	the prince ... with them,
c59273	When the people enter,
c59274	shall go in
c59276	and when they leave,
c59277	he shall leave.
c59278	At the festivals and appointed feasts, the grain offering shall be an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram,
c59279	and as much as one is able to give with the lambs,
c59280	along with a hin of oil per ephah.
c59281	When the prince makes a freewill offering to the LORD, whether a burnt offering or a peace offering,
c59282	the gate ... must be opened for him.
c59283	facing east
c59284	He is to offer his burnt offering or peace offering
c59285	just as he does on the Sabbath day.
c59286	Then he shall go out,
c59287	and the gate must be closed
c59288	after he goes out.
c59289	And you shall provide an unblemished lamb a year-old as a daily burnt offering to the LORD;
c59290	you are to offer it every morning.
c59291	You are also to provide with it every morning a grain offering of a sixth of an ephah
c59292	with a third of a hin of oil
c59293	to moisten the fine flour—
c59294	a grain offering to the LORD.
c59295	This is a perpetual statute.
c59296	Thus they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil every morning
c59297	as a regular burnt offering.’
c59298	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c59299	‘If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons
c59300	as an inheritance, it
c59301	will belong to his descendants. It will become
c59302	their property by inheritance.
c59303	But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants,
c59304	it will belong to that servant until the year of freedom;
c59305	then it will revert to the prince.
c59306	His inheritance belongs only
c59307	to his sons;
c59308	it shall be theirs.
c59309	The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people
c59310	by evicting them from their property.
c59311	He is to provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property,
c59312	so that none of My people will be displaced
c59313	from his property.’”
c59314	Then [the man] brought me through the entrance
c59315	at the side of the gate
c59316	into the holy chambers ... which belonged to the priests,
c59317	facing north,
c59318	and he showed me
c59319	a place there at the far western end
c59320	and said to me,
c59321	“This is the place
c59322	where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering,
c59323	and where they shall bake the grain offering,
c59324	so that they do not bring them into the outer court
c59325	and transmit holiness to the people.”
c59326	Then he brought me into the outer court
c59327	and led me around to its four corners,
c59328	and I saw
c59329	a separate court in each of its corners.
c59331	In the four corners of the outer court there were enclosed courts,
c59332	each forty [cubits] long
c59333	and thirty [cubits] wide.
c59334	Each of the four corner areas had the same dimensions.
c59335	Around the inside of each of the four [courts] [was] a row of masonry
c59336	with ovens built at the base of the walls on all sides.
c59337	And he said to me,
c59338	“These are the kitchens
c59339	where those who minister at the temple will cook the sacrifices of the people.”
c59340	Then [the man] brought me back to the entrance of the temple,
c59341	and I saw
c59342	water flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east
c59343	(for the temple faced east).
c59344	The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar.
c59345	Next he brought me out through the north gate
c59346	and led me around the outside to the outer gate
c59347	facing east,
c59348	and there I saw
c59349	the water trickling out from the south side.
c59350	As the man went eastward
c59351	with a measuring line in his hand,
c59352	he measured off a thousand cubits
c59353	and led me through ankle-deep water.
c59354	Then he measured off a thousand [cubits]
c59355	and led me through knee-deep water vvv.
c59356	Again he measured a thousand [cubits]
c59357	and led me through waist-deep water.
c59358	Once again he measured off a thousand [cubits],
c59359	but now it was a river
c59360	that I could not
c59361	cross,
c59362	because the water had risen
c59363	[and] was deep enough for swimming—
c59364	a river
c59365	that could not be crossed on foot.
c59366	he asked.
c59367	“Do you see this,
c59368	son of man?”
c59369	Then he led me
c59370	back to the bank of the river.
c59371	When I arrived,
c59372	I saw
c59373	a great number of trees along both banks of the river.
c59374	And he said to me,
c59375	“This water flows out to the eastern region
c59376	and goes down into the Arabah.
c59377	When it empties ... the sea,
c59378	into
c59379	the water there becomes fresh.
c59380	there will be
c59381	of living creatures
c59382	swarms
c59383	Wherever
c59384	the river flows,
c59386	[and]
c59387	a great number of fish,
c59388	because [it] flows there
c59389	and makes the waters fresh;
c59390	everything will flourish.
c59391	so wherever the river flows,
c59393	Fishermen will stand by the shore; from En-gedi to En-eglaim
c59394	they will spread their nets
c59395	[to catch] fish ... kinds,
c59396	of many ... like the fish of the Great Sea.
c59397	But the swamps and marshes
c59398	will not become fresh;
c59399	they will be left for salt.
c59400	Along both banks of the river, fruit trees of all kinds will grow.
c59401	Their leaves will not wither,
c59402	and their fruit will not fail.
c59403	Each month they will bear fruit,
c59404	because the water
c59405	from the sanctuary flows to them.
c59406	Their fruit will be used for food
c59407	and their leaves for healing.
c59408	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c59409	‘These [are] the boundaries
c59410	by which you are to divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel;
c59411	Joseph shall receive two portions.
c59412	You are to divide it
c59413	equally among them.
c59414	Because I swore with an uplifted hand
c59415	to give it to your forefathers,
c59416	this land will fall to you as an inheritance.
c59417	This [shall be] the boundary of the land:
c59418	On the north side it will extend from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon
c59419	through Lebo-hamath to Zedad,
c59420	Berothah, and Sibraim ... of Hamath),
c59421	(which is between the border of Damascus [and]
c59422	as far as Hazer-hatticon,
c59423	which is on the border of Hauran.
c59424	So the border will run from the Sea
c59425	to Hazar-enan,
c59426	border of Damascus,
c59427	along the northern ... to the north.
c59428	with the territory of Hamath
c59429	[This] [will be] the northern boundary.
c59430	On the east side it will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, from the northern border to the Eastern Sea ... as far as Tamar.
c59431	and ... This will be the eastern boundary.
c59432	On the south side it will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh,
c59433	and along the Brook [of Egypt] to the Great Sea.
c59434	This will be the southern boundary.
c59435	And on the west side, the Great Sea will be the boundary up to a point opposite
c59436	Lebo-hamath.
c59437	This will be the western boundary.
c59438	You are to divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
c59439	You are to treat them
c59440	You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners
c59441	who dwell among you
c59442	and who have children.
c59443	as native-born Israelites;
c59444	along with you, they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
c59446	tribe
c59447	In whatever ... the foreigner dwells,
c59448	you are to assign his inheritance there,
c59449	declares the Lord GOD.’
c59450	Now these are the names of the tribes:
c59451	At the northern frontier, ... bordering the road of Hethlon
c59452	to Lebo-hamath
c59453	and running on to Hazar-enan
c59454	on the border of Damascus with Hamath to the north,
c59455	and extending from the east side to the west side.
c59456	Dan will have one portion
c59457	Asher [will have] one portion bordering the territory of Dan from east to west.
c59458	Naphtali will have one portion bordering the territory of Asher from east to west.
c59459	Manasseh will have one portion bordering the territory of Naphtali from east to west.
c59460	Ephraim will have one portion bordering the territory of Manasseh from east to west.
c59461	Reuben will have one portion bordering the territory of Ephraim from east to west.
c59462	Judah will have one portion bordering the territory of Reuben from east to west.
c59463	Bordering the territory of Judah, from east to west, will be the portion ... side
c59464	you are to set apart.
c59465	It will be 25,000 [cubits] wide,
c59466	and the length of one of the tribal portions from the east ... to the west.
c59467	In the center will be the sanctuary.
c59468	The special portion
c59469	you set apart to the LORD
c59470	[shall be] 25,000 [cubits] long
c59471	and 10,000 [cubits] wide.
c59472	This will be the holy portion for the priests. It will be
c59473	25,000cubits long on the north,
c59474	10,000[cubits] wide on the west side,
c59475	10,000[cubits] wide on the east side,
c59476	and 25,000 [cubits] long on the south [side].
c59477	In the center will be the sanctuary of the LORD.
c59478	It will be for the consecrated priests, the descendants of Zadok,
c59479	who kept My charge
c59480	and did not go astray as
c59481	did when the Israelites went astray.
c59482	the Levites
c59483	It will be a special portion for them set apart from the land,
c59484	a Most Holy portion adjacent to the territory of the Levites.
c59485	Bordering the territory of the priests, the Levites
c59486	[shall have an area] 25,000 [cubits] long
c59487	and 10,000 cubits wide.
c59488	The whole length [will be] 25,000 [cubits],
c59489	and the width 10,000[cubits].
c59490	They must not sell ... any of it,
c59491	or exchange ... not
c59492	and they must ... transfer this best [part] of the land,
c59493	for it is holy to the LORD.
c59494	5,000[cubits]
c59495	The remaining area, ... wide and 25,000 [cubits long],
c59496	will be for the common use of the city, for houses and pasturelands.
c59497	The city will be in the center of it
c59498	and will have these measurements:
c59499	4,500[cubits] on the north side,
c59500	4,500[cubits] on the south side,
c59501	on the east side, and 4,500 [cubits]
c59502	on the west side.
c59503	The pastureland of the city will extend
c59504	250[cubits] to the north,
c59505	250[cubits] to the south,
c59506	250[cubits] to the east,
c59507	and 250 [cubits] to the west.
c59509	The remainder of the length bordering the holy portion
c59510	will be 10,000 [cubits] on the east side
c59511	and 10,000 [cubits] on the west side.
c59512	and running adjacent to [it]
c59513	Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city.
c59515	The workers of the city
c59516	who cultivate it will come from all the tribes of Israel.
c59517	The entire portion ... 25,000[cubits] by 25,000 [cubits].
c59518	[will be] a square, ... You are to set apart the holy portion, along with the city property.
c59520	The remaining area
c59521	will belong to the prince.
c59522	on both sides of the holy portion and of the property of the city ... He will own the land adjacent to the [tribal] portions, extending [eastward] from the 25,000 [cubits] of the [holy] district toward the eastern border, [and] westward from the 25,000 [cubits] to the western border.
c59523	And in the center of them will be the holy portion and the sanctuary of the temple.
c59524	So for the Levitical property and the city property [will lie] in the center
c59525	of the area belonging to the prince.
c59526	[The area] between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin will belong to the prince.
c59527	As for the rest of the tribes:
c59528	Benjamin will have one portion extending from the east side to the west side.
c59529	Simeon will have one portion bordering the territory of Benjamin from east to west.
c59530	Issachar will have one portion bordering the territory of Simeon from east to west.
c59531	Zebulun will have one portion bordering the territory of Issachar from east to west.
c59532	[And] Gad will have one portion bordering the territory of Zebulun from east to west.
c59533	The southern ... of Gad
c59534	border ... will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh,
c59535	then along the Brook [of Egypt] and out to the Great Sea.
c59536	This is the land
c59537	you are to allot as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel,
c59538	and these will be their portions,
c59539	declares the Lord GOD.
c59540	These will be the exits of the city:
c59541	Beginning on the north side, which measures 4,500[cubits long],
c59542	the gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel.
c59543	On the north side [there will be] three gates:
c59544	the gate of Reuben,
c59545	the gate of Judah,
c59546	and the gate of Levi.
c59547	On the east side, which will be 4,500 [cubits long],
c59548	there will be three gates:
c59549	the gate of Joseph,
c59550	the gate of Benjamin,
c59551	and the gate of Dan.
c59552	On the south side, which will be 4,500[cubits long],
c59553	there will be three gates:
c59554	the gate of Simeon,
c59555	the gate of Issachar,
c59556	and the gate of Zebulun.
c59557	And on the west side, which will be 4,500 [cubits long],
c59558	there will be three gates:
c59559	the gate of Gad,
c59560	the gate of Asher,
c59561	and the gate of Naphtali.
c59562	The perimeter [of the city will be] 18,000 [cubits],
c59563	and the name of the city from [that] day on will be:
c59564	THE LORD [IS] THERE.”
c59565	[This is] the word of the LORD
c59566	that came to Hosea son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and [of] Jeroboam son of Jehoash, king of Israel.
c59567	first
c59568	When the LORD ... spoke to Hosea,
c59569	He told him,
c59570	“Go,
c59571	take a prostitute as your wife and have children of adultery,
c59572	because this land is flagrantly prostituting itself [by departing] from the LORD.”
c59573	So [Hosea] went
c59574	and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim,
c59575	and she conceived
c59576	and bore him a son.
c59577	Then the LORD said to [Hosea],
c59578	“Name him Jezreel,
c59579	for soon
c59580	I will bring the bloodshed of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu,
c59581	and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel.
c59582	And on that day
c59583	I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”
c59584	[Gomer] again conceived
c59585	and gave birth to a daughter,
c59586	and [the LORD] said to [Hosea],
c59587	“Name her Lo-ruhamah,
c59588	for I will no longer
c59589	have compassion on the house of Israel,
c59590	that I should ever forgive them.
c59591	Yet I will have compassion on the house of Judah,
c59592	and I will deliver them, ... but by the LORD their God.”
c59593	not by bow or sword or war, not by horses and cavalry,
c59594	After she had weaned Lo-ruhamah,
c59595	[Gomer] conceived
c59596	and gave birth to a son.
c59597	And the LORD said,
c59598	“Name him Lo-ammi,
c59599	for you are not My people,
c59600	and I am not your God.
c59601	Yet the number of the Israelites will be like the sand of the sea,
c59602	which cannot be measured
c59603	[or] numbered.
c59604	And
c59605	in the place
c59606	where it was said to them,
c59607	‘You [are] not My people,’
c59608	they will be called
c59609	‘sons of the living God.’
c59610	Then the people of Judah [and] of Israel will be gathered together,
c59611	and they will appoint for themselves one leader,
c59612	and will go up out of the land.
c59613	For great [will be] the day of Jezreel.
c59614	“Say of your brothers,
c59615	‘My people,’
c59616	and of your sisters,
c59617	‘My loved one.’
c59618	Rebuke your mother,
c59619	rebuke her.
c59620	For she is not My wife,
c59621	and I am not her husband.
c59622	Let her remove the adultery from her face
c59623	and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.
c59624	Otherwise, I will strip her naked
c59625	and expose her like the day
c59626	of her birth.
c59627	I will make her like a desert
c59628	and turn her into a parched land,
c59629	and I will let her die of thirst.
c59630	I will have no compassion on her children
c59631	because they are the children of adultery.
c59632	For their mother has played the harlot
c59633	and has conceived them in disgrace.
c59634	For she thought,
c59635	‘I will go after my lovers, who give me bread and water, wool and linen, oil and drink.’
c59636	Therefore,
c59637	behold, I will hedge up her path with thorns;
c59638	I will enclose her with a wall,
c59639	so she cannot find her way.
c59640	She will pursue her lovers
c59641	but not catch them;
c59642	she will seek them
c59643	but not find them.
c59644	Then she will say,
c59646	‘I will return to my first husband,
c59647	for then I was better off than now.’
c59648	For she does not acknowledge
c59649	that it was I who gave her grain, new wine and oil,
c59650	who lavished her with silver
c59651	and gold— which was crafted for Baal.
c59652	Therefore I will take back
c59653	My grain in its time
c59654	and My new wine in its season;
c59655	I will take away My wool and linen,
c59656	which were [given] to cover her nakedness.
c59657	And then
c59658	I will expose her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
c59659	and no one will deliver her out of My hands.
c59660	I will put an end to all her exultation: her feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths— all her appointed feasts.
c59661	I will destroy her vines and fig trees,
c59662	which she thinks
c59663	are the wages
c59664	paid by her lovers.
c59665	So I will make them into a thicket,
c59666	and the beasts of the field will devour them.
c59667	I will punish her for the days of the Baals
c59668	when she burned incense to them,
c59669	when she decked herself with rings and jewelry,
c59670	and went after her lovers.
c59671	But Me she forgot,”
c59672	declares the LORD.
c59673	“Therefore,
c59674	behold, I will allure her
c59675	and lead her to the wilderness,
c59676	and speak to her tenderly.
c59677	There I will give back her vineyards
c59678	and make the Valley of Achor into a gateway of hope.
c59679	There she will respond as she did in the days of her youth, as in the day
c59680	she came up out of Egypt.
c59682	In that day,”
c59683	declares the LORD,
c59684	“you will call Me
c59685	‘my husband,’
c59686	and no longer call Me
c59687	‘my Master.’
c59688	For I will remove from her lips the names of the Baals;
c59689	no longer will their names be invoked.
c59690	On that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field [and] the birds of the air and the creatures that crawl on the ground.
c59691	And I will abolish bow and sword and weapons of war in the land,
c59692	and will make them lie down in safety.
c59693	So I will betroth you to Me forever;
c59694	I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in loving devotion and compassion.
c59695	And I will betroth you in faithfulness,
c59696	and you will know the LORD.”
c59698	“On that day I will respond—”
c59699	declares the LORD—
c59700	“I will respond to the heavens,
c59701	and they will respond to the earth.
c59702	And the earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine and oil,
c59703	and they will respond to Jezreel.
c59704	And I will sow her for Myself in the land,
c59705	and I will have compassion on ‘No Compassion.’
c59706	I will say to those [called] ... ‘Not are My people,’
c59707	My People,’ ‘You
c59708	and they will say,
c59709	‘You are my God.’”
c59710	Then the LORD said to me,
c59711	“Go ... again,
c59712	show love to your wife
c59713	though she is loved by another
c59714	and is an adulteress.
c59715	[Love her] as the LORD ... the Israelites,
c59716	though they turn to other gods
c59717	loves ... [and offer] cakes of raisin.”
c59718	So I bought her for fifteen [shekels] of silver and a homer and a lethek of barley.
c59719	Then I said to her,
c59720	“You must live with me for many days;
c59721	you must not be promiscuous
c59722	or belong to another,
c59723	and I will do the same for you.”
c59724	For the Israelites must live many days
c59725	without king
c59726	or prince, without
c59727	sacrifice ... and without
c59728	or sacred pillar,
c59729	ephod or idol.
c59730	Afterward, the people of Israel will return
c59731	and seek the LORD their God and David their king.
c59732	They will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days.
c59733	Hear the word of the LORD,
c59734	O children of Israel,
c59735	for the LORD has a case against the inhabitants of the land:
c59736	There is no truth,
c59737	no loving devotion,
c59738	and no knowledge of God in the land!
c59739	Cursing
c59740	and lying,
c59741	murder
c59742	and stealing,
c59743	and adultery
c59744	are rampant;
c59745	one act of bloodshed follows another.
c59746	Therefore the land mourns,
c59747	and all ... will waste away
c59748	who dwell in it
c59749	with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air;
c59750	even the fish of the sea disappear.
c59751	But let no man contend;
c59752	let no man offer reproof;
c59753	for your people [are] like those who contend against a priest.
c59754	You will stumble by day,
c59755	and the prophet will stumble with you by night.
c59756	So I will destroy your mother—
c59757	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
c59758	Because you have rejected knowledge,
c59759	I will also reject you
c59760	as My priests.
c59761	Since you have forgotten the law of your God,
c59762	I will also forget your children.
c59763	The more they multiplied,
c59764	the more they sinned against Me;
c59765	they exchanged their Glory for a thing of disgrace.
c59766	They feed on the sin of My people
c59767	and set their heart on iniquity.
c59768	And it shall be like people, like priest.
c59769	I will punish both of them for their ways
c59770	and repay them for their deeds.
c59771	They will eat
c59772	but not be satisfied;
c59773	they will be promiscuous
c59774	but not multiply.
c59775	For they have stopped ... the LORD.
c59776	obeying
c59777	Promiscuity, wine, and new wine take away understanding.
c59778	My people consult their wooden idols,
c59779	and their divining rods inform them.
c59780	For a spirit of prostitution leads them astray
c59781	and they have played the harlot against their God.
c59782	They sacrifice on the mountaintops
c59783	and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth,
c59784	because their shade is pleasant.
c59785	And so your daughters turn to prostitution
c59786	and your daughters-in-law to adultery.
c59787	I will not punish your daughters
c59788	when they prostitute themselves
c59789	[or] your daughters-in-law
c59790	when they commit adultery,
c59791	because the men themselves go off with prostitutes
c59792	and make sacrifices with cult prostitutes.
c59793	So a people
c59794	without understanding
c59795	will come to ruin.
c59796	Though you prostitute yourself,
c59797	O Israel,
c59798	may Judah avoid such guilt!
c59799	Do not go to Gilgal,
c59800	do not go up to Beth-aven, and do not
c59801	swear on oath,
c59802	‘As surely as the LORD lives!’
c59803	For Israel is as obstinate as a stubborn heifer.
c59804	Can the LORD now shepherd them like lambs in an open meadow?
c59805	Ephraim is joined to idols;
c59806	leave him alone!
c59807	When their liquor is gone,
c59808	they turn to prostitution;
c59809	love
c59810	dearly ... disgrace.
c59811	their rulers
c59812	The wind has wrapped them in its wings
c59813	and their sacrifices will bring them shame.
c59814	Hear this,
c59815	O priests!
c59816	Take heed,
c59817	O house of Israel!
c59818	O royal house!
c59819	Give ear,
c59820	For the judgment is against you
c59821	because you have been a snare at Mizpah
c59822	and a net
c59823	spread out on Tabor.
c59824	The rebels are deep in slaughter;
c59825	but I will chastise all of them.
c59826	I know Ephraim,
c59827	and Israel is not hidden from Me.
c59828	For now, ... you have turned to prostitution;
c59829	O Ephraim,
c59830	Israel is defiled.
c59831	Their deeds do not permit them
c59832	to return to their God,
c59833	for a spirit of prostitution is within them,
c59834	and they do not know the LORD.
c59835	Israel’s arrogance testifies against them;
c59836	both Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity;
c59837	even Judah stumbles with them.
c59838	They go with their flocks and herds
c59839	to seek the LORD,
c59840	but they do not find Him;
c59841	He has withdrawn Himself from them.
c59842	They have been unfaithful to the LORD;
c59843	for they have borne illegitimate children.
c59844	Now the New Moon will devour them along with their land.
c59845	Blow the horn in Gibeah,
c59846	the trumpet in Ramah;
c59847	raise the battle cry in Beth-aven:
c59848	Lead on,
c59849	O Benjamin!
c59850	Ephraim will be laid waste on the day of rebuke;
c59851	among the tribes of Israel I declare
c59852	what is certain.
c59853	The princes of Judah are like those who move boundary stones;
c59854	I will pour out My fury upon them like water.
c59855	Ephraim is oppressed,
c59856	crushed in judgment,
c59857	for he is determined
c59858	to follow what is worthless.
c59859	So I am like a moth to Ephraim,
c59860	and like decay to the house of Judah.
c59861	When Ephraim saw his sickness
c59862	and Judah his wound,
c59863	then Ephraim turned to Assyria
c59864	and sent to the great king.
c59865	But he cannot
c59866	cure you
c59867	[or] heal your wound.
c59868	For I am like a lion to Ephraim
c59869	and like a young lion to the house of Judah.
c59870	I, [even] I, will tear them to pieces
c59871	and go away.
c59872	I will carry them off
c59873	[where] no one can rescue them.
c59874	Then I will return
c59875	to My place
c59876	until they admit their guilt
c59877	and seek My face;
c59878	in their affliction they will earnestly seek Me.”
c59879	Come,
c59880	let us return to the LORD.
c59881	For He has torn us to pieces,
c59882	but He will heal us;
c59883	He has wounded us,
c59884	but He will bind us up.
c59885	After two days He will revive us;
c59886	on the third day He will raise us up,
c59887	that we may live in His presence.
c59888	So let us know—
c59889	let us press
c59890	on to know the LORD.
c59891	As surely as the sun rises, He will appear;
c59892	He will come to us like the rain,
c59893	like the spring showers that water the earth.
c59894	What shall I do with you,
c59895	O Ephraim?
c59896	What shall I do with you,
c59897	O Judah?
c59898	For your loyalty is like a morning mist, ... dew
c59899	like the early
c59900	that vanishes.
c59901	Therefore I have hewn [them] by the prophets;
c59902	I have slain them by the words of My mouth,
c59903	and My judgments go forth like lightning.
c59904	For I desire mercy,
c59905	not sacrifice,
c59906	and the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
c59907	But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant;
c59908	there they were unfaithful to Me.
c59909	Gilead is a city of evildoers,
c59910	tracked with footprints of blood.
c59911	Like raiders who lie in ambush, [so does] a band of priests;
c59912	they murder on the way to Shechem;
c59913	surely they have committed atrocities.
c59914	In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing:
c59915	There Ephraim practices prostitution
c59916	[and] Israel is defiled.
c59917	Also ... O Judah,
c59918	for you, ... a harvest is appointed,
c59919	when I will restore My people from captivity.
c59920	When I would heal Israel,
c59921	the iniquity of Ephraim is exposed, with the crimes of Samaria.
c59922	For they practice deceit
c59923	and thieves break in;
c59924	bandits rob [in the streets].
c59925	But they fail to consider in their hearts
c59926	that I remember all their evil.
c59927	Now their deeds are all around them;
c59928	they are before My face.
c59929	They delight the king with their evil,
c59930	the princes with their lies.
c59931	They are all adulterers,
c59932	like an oven
c59933	heated by a baker
c59934	who needs not
c59935	stoke the fire
c59936	from the kneading ... of the dough.
c59937	to the rising
c59938	The princes are inflamed with wine on the day of our king;
c59939	so he joins hands with those who mock him.
c59940	For they prepare their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait;
c59941	all night their anger smolders;
c59942	in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
c59943	All of them are as hot as an oven,
c59944	and they consume their rulers.
c59945	All their kings fall;
c59946	not one of them calls upon Me.
c59947	Ephraim
c59948	mixes with the nations;
c59949	Ephraim is ... cake.
c59950	an unturned
c59951	Foreigners consume his strength,
c59952	but he does not notice.
c59953	Even his hair is streaked with gray,
c59954	but he does not realize.
c59955	Israel’s arrogance testifies against them,
c59956	yet they do not return to the LORD their God;
c59957	despite all this, they do not seek Him.
c59958	So Ephraim has become like a silly, ... dove—
c59959	senseless
c59960	calling out to Egypt,
c59961	then turning to Assyria.
c59962	As they go,
c59963	I will spread My net over them;
c59964	I will bring them down like birds of the air.
c59965	I will chastise them when I hear them flocking together.
c59966	Woe to them,
c59967	for they have strayed from Me!
c59968	Destruction to them,
c59969	for they have rebelled against Me!
c59970	Though I would redeem them,
c59971	they speak lies against Me.
c59972	They do not cry out to Me from their hearts
c59973	when they wail upon their beds.
c59974	They slash themselves for grain and new wine,
c59975	but turn away from Me.
c59976	Although I trained
c59977	and strengthened their arms,
c59978	they plot evil against Me.
c59979	They turn,
c59980	but not to the Most High;
c59981	they are like a faulty bow.
c59982	Their leaders will fall by the sword for the cursing of their tongue;
c59983	for this they will be ridiculed in the land of Egypt.
c59984	[Put] the trumpet to your lips!
c59985	An eagle comes against the house of the LORD,
c59986	because they have transgressed My covenant
c59987	and rebelled against My law.
c59988	cries out to Me,
c59989	“O our God,
c59990	we know You!”
c59991	Israel
c59992	[But] Israel has rejected good;
c59993	an enemy will pursue him.
c59994	They set up kings,
c59995	but not by Me.
c59996	They make princes,
c59997	but without My approval.
c59998	With their silver and gold they make themselves idols,
c59999	to their own destruction.
c60000	He has rejected your calf,
c60001	O Samaria.
c60002	My anger burns against them.
c60003	How long will they be incapable of innocence?
c60004	For ... is from Israel—
c60005	this thing
c60006	a craftsman made it,
c60007	and it is not God.
c60008	It will be broken to pieces, that calf of Samaria.
c60009	Indeed, they sow the wind
c60010	and reap the whirlwind.
c60011	There is no standing grain;
c60012	what sprouts fails to yield flour.
c60013	Even if it should produce,
c60014	the foreigners would swallow it up.
c60015	Israel is swallowed up!
c60016	Now they are among the nations ... vessel.
c60017	like a worthless
c60018	For they have gone up to Assyria
c60019	like a wild donkey
c60020	on its own
c60021	Ephraim has hired lovers.
c60022	Though they hire allies among the nations,
c60023	I will now round them up,
c60024	and they will begin to diminish under the oppression of the king of princes.
c60025	Though Ephraim multiplied the altars
c60026	for sin,
c60027	they became his altars
c60028	for sinning.
c60029	Though I wrote for them the great things of My law,
c60030	they regarded them as something strange.
c60031	sacrifices given to Me
c60032	Though they offer ... the meat,
c60033	and eat
c60034	the LORD does not accept them.
c60035	Now He will remember their iniquity
c60036	and punish their sins:
c60037	They will return to Egypt.
c60038	Israel has forgotten his Maker
c60039	and built palaces;
c60040	Judah has multiplied its fortified cities.
c60041	But I will send fire upon their cities,
c60042	and it will consume their citadels.
c60043	Do not rejoice,
c60044	O Israel,
c60045	with exultation like the nations,
c60046	for you have played the harlot against your God;
c60047	you have made love [for] hire on every threshing floor.
c60048	The threshing floor and winepress will not feed them,
c60049	and the new wine will fail them.
c60050	They will not remain in the land of the LORD;
c60051	Ephraim will return to Egypt
c60052	and eat unclean food in Assyria.
c60053	They will not pour out wine [offerings] to the LORD,
c60054	will not please Him,
c60055	and their sacrifices ... [but will be] to them like the bread of mourners;
c60056	all who eat it will be defiled.
c60057	For their bread will be for themselves;
c60058	it will not enter the house of the LORD.
c60059	What will you do on the appointed day,
c60060	on the Day of the LORD’s feast?
c60061	For even if
c60062	they flee destruction,
c60063	Egypt will gather them
c60064	and Memphis will bury them.
c60065	Their precious silver
c60066	will be taken over by thistles,
c60067	[and] thorns [will overrun] their tents.
c60068	The days of punishment have come;
c60069	the days of retribution have arrived—
c60070	let Israel know it.
c60071	The prophet is [called] a fool,
c60072	and the inspired man insane,
c60073	because of the greatness of your iniquity
c60074	and hostility.
c60075	is Ephraim’s watchman, along with my God,
c60076	The prophet
c60077	[yet] the snare of the fowler [lies] on all his paths.
c60078	Hostility is in the house of his God!
c60079	They have deeply
c60080	corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah;
c60081	He will remember their guilt;
c60082	He will punish their sins.
c60083	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.
c60084	I saw your fathers as the firstfruits of the fig tree in its first season.
c60085	But they went to Baal-peor,
c60086	and consecrated themselves to Shame;
c60087	so they became as detestable as the thing they loved.
c60088	Ephraim’s
c60089	glory will fly away like a bird,
c60090	with no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception.
c60091	Even if they raise their children,
c60092	I will bereave them of each one.
c60093	Yes, woe [be] to them
c60094	when I turn away from them!
c60095	Ephraim,
c60096	I have seen ... like
c60097	Tyre,
c60098	planted in a meadow.
c60099	But Ephraim
c60100	will bring out his children for slaughter.
c60101	Give them,
c60102	O LORD—
c60103	what will You give?
c60104	Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that dry up!
c60105	All their evil appears at Gilgal,
c60106	for there I hated them.
c60107	I will drive them from My house for the wickedness of their deeds.
c60108	I will no longer
c60109	love them;
c60110	all their leaders are rebellious.
c60111	Ephraim is struck down;
c60112	their root is withered;
c60113	they cannot bear fruit.
c60114	Even if they bear children,
c60115	I will slay the darlings of their wombs.
c60116	My God will reject them
c60117	because they have not obeyed Him;
c60118	and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
c60119	Israel was a luxuriant vine,
c60120	yielding fruit for himself.
c60121	The more his fruit increased, the more he increased the altars.
c60122	The better his land produced,
c60123	the better he made the sacred pillars.
c60124	Their hearts are devious;
c60125	now they must bear their guilt.
c60126	The LORD will break down their altars
c60127	and demolish their sacred pillars.
c60128	Surely now they will say,
c60129	“We have no king,
c60130	for we do not revere the LORD.
c60131	can a king
c60132	What ... do for us?”
c60133	They speak mere words;
c60134	with false oaths
c60135	they make covenants.
c60136	So judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.
c60137	The people of Samaria will fear for the calf of Beth-aven.
c60138	Indeed, its people will mourn for it with its idolatrous priests—
c60139	those who rejoiced in
c60140	its glory—
c60141	for it has been taken from them into exile.
c60142	Yes, it will be carried to Assyria
c60143	as tribute to the great king.
c60144	Ephraim will be seized with shame
c60145	and Israel ashamed of its wooden idols.
c60146	Samaria will be carried off
c60147	[with] her king like a twig on the surface of the water.
c60148	The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed;
c60149	thorns and thistles will grow over their altars.
c60150	Then they will say to the mountains,
c60151	“Cover us!”
c60152	and to the hills,
c60153	“Fall on us!”
c60154	Since the days of Gibeah you have sinned,
c60155	O Israel,
c60156	and there you have remained.
c60157	Did not the battle in Gibeah overtake the sons of iniquity?
c60158	when I please;
c60159	I will chasten them
c60160	nations will be gathered against them
c60161	to put them in bondage for their double transgression.
c60162	Ephraim is a well-trained heifer
c60163	that loves
c60164	to thresh;
c60165	but I will place a yoke on her fair neck.
c60166	I will harness Ephraim,
c60167	Judah will plow,
c60168	[and] Jacob will break the hard ground.
c60169	Sow for yourselves righteousness
c60170	and reap the fruit of loving devotion;
c60171	break up your unplowed ground.
c60172	For [it is] time
c60173	to seek the LORD
c60174	until He comes
c60175	and sends righteousness upon you like rain.
c60176	You have plowed wickedness
c60177	and reaped injustice;
c60178	you have eaten the fruit of lies.
c60179	Because you have trusted in your own way and in the multitude of your mighty men,
c60180	the roar of battle will rise against your people,
c60181	so that all your fortresses will be demolished
c60182	as Shalman devastated Beth-arbel in the day of battle,
c60183	when mothers were dashed to pieces along with their children.
c60184	Thus it will be done to you,
c60185	O Bethel,
c60186	because of your great wickedness.
c60187	When the day dawns, the king of Israel will be utterly cut off.
c60188	When Israel was a child,
c60189	I loved him,
c60190	and out of Egypt I called My son.
c60191	But the more I called them,
c60192	the farther they departed from Me.
c60193	They sacrificed to the Baals
c60194	and burned incense to carved images.
c60195	It was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
c60196	taking them in My arms,
c60197	but they never realized
c60198	that it was I who healed them.
c60199	I led with cords of kindness,
c60200	with ropes of love;
c60201	I lifted the yoke from their neck
c60202	and bent down
c60203	to feed them.
c60204	Will they not return to the land of Egypt
c60205	by Assyria
c60206	and be ruled
c60207	because they refused
c60208	to repent?
c60209	A sword will whirl through their cities;
c60210	it will destroy the bars of their gates
c60211	and consume [them] in their own plans.
c60212	My people are bent on turning from Me.
c60213	Though they call to the Most High,
c60214	He will by no means exalt them.
c60215	How can I give you up,
c60216	O Ephraim?
c60217	How can I surrender you,
c60218	O Israel?
c60219	How can I make you like Admah?
c60220	How can I treat you like Zeboiim?
c60221	My heart is turned within Me;
c60222	My compassion is stirred!
c60223	I will not execute the full fury of My anger;
c60224	I will not turn back
c60225	to destroy Ephraim.
c60226	For I am God
c60227	and not man—
c60228	the Holy One among you—
c60229	and I will not come in wrath.
c60230	They will walk after the LORD;
c60231	He will roar like a lion.
c60232	When He roars,
c60233	His children will come trembling from the west.
c60234	They will come trembling like birds from Egypt
c60235	and like doves from the land of Assyria.
c60236	Then I will settle them in their homes,
c60237	declares the LORD.
c60238	Ephraim surrounds me with lies,
c60239	the house of Israel with deceit;
c60240	but Judah still walks with God
c60241	[and is] faithful to the Holy One.
c60242	Ephraim chases the wind
c60243	and pursues the east wind all day long;
c60244	he multiplies lies and violence;
c60245	he makes a covenant with Assyria
c60246	and sends olive oil to Egypt.
c60247	The LORD also [brings] a charge against Judah.
c60248	He will punish Jacob according to his ways
c60249	and repay him according to his deeds.
c60250	In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel,
c60251	and in his vigor he wrestled with God.
c60252	Yes, he struggled with the Angel
c60253	and prevailed;
c60254	he wept
c60255	and sought His favor;
c60256	he found Him at Bethel,
c60257	and there He spoke with us—
c60258	the LORD is the God of Hosts—
c60259	the LORD is His name of renown.
c60260	But you
c60261	must return to your God,
c60262	maintaining love and justice,
c60263	and always waiting on your God.
c60264	A merchant
c60265	with dishonest scales in his hands.
c60266	to defraud
c60267	loves
c60268	And Ephraim boasts:
c60269	“How rich I have become;
c60270	I have found wealth for myself.
c60271	In all my labors,
c60272	they can find in me no iniquity
c60273	that [is] sin.”
c60274	But I [am] the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt.
c60275	I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast.
c60276	I spoke through the prophets
c60277	and multiplied their visions;
c60278	I gave parables through the prophets.
c60279	Is there iniquity [in] Gilead?
c60280	They will surely come to nothing.
c60281	Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal?
c60282	Indeed, their altars [will be] heaps of stones in the furrows of the field.
c60283	Jacob fled to the land of Aram,
c60284	and Israel worked for a wife;
c60285	for a wife he tended [sheep].
c60286	But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt,
c60287	and by a prophet he was preserved.
c60288	Ephraim has provoked bitter anger,
c60289	will leave his bloodguilt upon him
c60290	so his Lord ... and repay him for his contempt.
c60291	When Ephraim spoke,
c60292	there was trembling;
c60293	he was exalted in Israel.
c60294	But he incurred guilt through Baal,
c60295	and he died.
c60296	Now ... more and more
c60297	they sin
c60298	and make for themselves cast images,
c60299	idols skillfully made from their silver,
c60300	all ... the work of craftsmen.
c60301	of them ... People say of them,
c60302	“Let the men who offer human sacrifice
c60303	kiss the calves!”
c60304	Therefore they will be like the morning mist, ... dew
c60305	like the early
c60306	that vanishes,
c60307	like chaff
c60308	blown from a threshing floor,
c60309	and like smoke through an open window.
c60310	Yet I [am] the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt;
c60311	you know no God but Me,
c60312	for [there is] no Savior besides Me.
c60313	I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of drought.
c60314	When they had pasture,
c60315	they became satisfied;
c60316	when they were satisfied,
c60317	their hearts became proud.
c60318	As a result, they forgot Me.
c60319	So I will pounce on them like a lion;
c60320	like a leopard on the path I will lurk.
c60321	Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will attack them,
c60322	and I will tear open their chests.
c60323	There I will devour them like a lion,
c60324	like a wild beast would tear them apart.
c60325	[It is] your destruction,
c60326	O Israel,
c60327	because you are against Me, your helper.
c60328	Where is your king now
c60329	to save you in all your cities,
c60330	and the rulers
c60331	to whom you said,
c60332	“Give me a king and princes”?
c60333	So in My anger I gave you a king,
c60334	and in My wrath I took [him] away.
c60335	The iniquity of Ephraim [is] bound up;
c60336	his sin [is] stored up.
c60337	Labor pains come upon him,
c60338	but he is ... son.
c60339	an unwise
c60340	When the time has arrived,
c60341	he does not present himself at the opening of the womb.
c60342	I will ransom them from the power of Sheol;
c60343	I will redeem them from Death.
c60344	Where, ... are your plagues?
c60345	O Death,
c60346	Where, ... is your sting?
c60347	O Sheol,
c60348	Compassion is hidden from My eyes.
c60349	Although he flourishes among his brothers,
c60350	an east wind will come,
c60351	a wind from the LORD rising up from the desert.
c60352	His fountain will fail,
c60353	and his spring will run dry.
c60354	The wind will plunder his treasury of every precious article.
c60355	Samaria will bear her guilt
c60356	because she has rebelled against her God.
c60357	They will fall by the sword;
c60358	their little ones will be dashed to pieces,
c60359	and their pregnant women ripped open.
c60360	Return,
c60361	O Israel,
c60362	to the LORD your God,
c60363	for you have stumbled by your iniquity.
c60364	Bring your confessions
c60365	and return to the LORD.
c60366	Say to Him:
c60367	“Take away all our iniquity
c60368	and receive [us] graciously,
c60369	that we may present the fruit of our lips.
c60370	Assyria will not save us,
c60371	nor will we ride on horses.
c60372	We will never again say,
c60373	‘Our gods!’
c60374	to the work of our own hands.
c60375	For in You the orphan finds compassion.”
c60376	I will heal their apostasy;
c60377	I will freely love them,
c60378	for My anger has turned away from them.
c60379	I will be like the dew to Israel;
c60380	he will blossom like the lily
c60381	and take root like the cedars of Lebanon.
c60382	His shoots will sprout,
c60383	and his splendor will be like the olive tree,
c60384	his fragrance like [the cedars of] Lebanon.
c60385	They will return
c60386	and dwell in his shade;
c60387	they will grow grain
c60388	and blossom like the vine.
c60389	His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.
c60390	O Ephraim,
c60391	what have I to do anymore with idols?
c60392	It is I who answer
c60393	and watch over him.
c60394	I [am] like a green cypress tree;
c60395	your fruit comes from Me.
c60396	Whoever is wise,
c60397	let him understand these things;
c60398	[whoever] is discerning,
c60399	let him know them.
c60400	For the ways of the LORD are right,
c60401	and the righteous walk in them,
c60402	but the rebellious stumble in them.
c60403	[This is] the word of the LORD
c60404	that came to Joel son of Pethuel:
c60405	Hear this,
c60406	O elders;
c60407	and give ear,
c60408	all who dwell in the land.
c60409	Has anything like this ever happened in your days
c60410	or in the days of your forefathers?
c60411	Tell your children about it,
c60412	and let your children tell their children—
c60413	and their children, the next generation.
c60414	What the devouring locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten;
c60415	what the swarming locust has left, the young locust has eaten;
c60416	and what the young locust has left, the destroying locust has eaten.
c60417	Wake up,
c60418	you drunkards,
c60419	and weep;
c60420	wail,
c60421	all you drinkers of wine,
c60422	because of the sweet wine,
c60423	for it has been cut off from your mouth.
c60424	For a nation has invaded My land,
c60425	powerful
c60426	and without number;
c60427	its teeth are [those] of a lion,
c60428	and its fangs [are those] of a lioness.
c60429	It has laid waste My grapevine
c60430	and splintered My fig tree.
c60431	It has stripped off the bark
c60432	and thrown it away;
c60433	the branches have turned white.
c60434	Wail like a virgin dressed in sackcloth, grieving for the husband of her youth.
c60435	Grain and drink offerings have been cut off from the house of the LORD;
c60436	the priests are in mourning, those who minister before the LORD.
c60437	The field is ruined;
c60438	the land mourns;
c60439	indeed, the grain is destroyed;
c60440	the new wine is dried up,
c60441	the oil fails.
c60442	Be dismayed, O farmers,
c60443	wail, O vinedressers, over the wheat and barley,
c60444	because the harvest of the field has perished.
c60445	The grapevine is dried up,
c60446	and the fig tree is withered;
c60447	the pomegranate, palm, and apple— all the trees of the orchard— are withered.
c60448	Surely the joy of mankind has dried up.
c60449	Put on [sackcloth]
c60450	and lament,
c60451	O priests;
c60452	wail,
c60453	O ministers of the altar.
c60454	Come,
c60455	spend the night in sackcloth,
c60456	O ministers of my God,
c60457	because the grain and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.
c60458	Consecrate a fast;
c60459	proclaim a solemn assembly!
c60460	Gather the elders and all the residents of the land to the house of the LORD your God,
c60461	and cry out to the LORD.
c60462	Alas for the day!
c60463	For the Day of the LORD is near,
c60464	and it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
c60465	Has not the food been cut off before our very eyes—
c60466	joy and gladness from the house of our God?
c60467	The seeds lie shriveled beneath the clods;
c60468	the storehouses are in ruins;
c60469	the granaries are broken down,
c60470	for the grain has withered away.
c60471	How the cattle groan!
c60472	The herds wander in confusion
c60473	because they have no pasture.
c60474	Even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
c60475	To You,
c60476	O LORD,
c60477	I call,
c60478	for fire has consumed the open pastures
c60479	and flames have scorched all the trees of the field.
c60480	Even the beasts of the field pant for You,
c60481	for the streams of water have dried up,
c60482	and fire has consumed the open pastures.
c60483	Blow the trumpet in Zion;
c60484	sound the alarm on My holy mountain!
c60485	Let all who dwell in the land tremble,
c60486	for the Day of the LORD is coming;
c60487	in fact, it is at hand—
c60488	a day of darkness and gloom,
c60489	a day of clouds and blackness.
c60490	Like the dawn
c60491	overspreading the mountains
c60492	a great and strong people appears,
c60493	such as never was of old,
c60494	nor will ever be in ages to come.
c60495	Before them a fire devours,
c60496	and behind them a flame scorches.
c60497	The land before them is like the Garden of Eden,
c60498	but behind them, it is like a desert wasteland—
c60499	surely nothing will escape them.
c60500	Their appearance is like that of horses,
c60501	and they gallop like swift steeds.
c60502	With a sound like that of chariots they bound over the mountaintops,
c60503	like the crackling of fire
c60504	consuming stubble,
c60505	like a mighty army
c60506	deployed for battle.
c60507	Nations writhe in horror before them;
c60508	every face turns pale.
c60509	They charge like mighty men;
c60510	they scale walls like men of war.
c60512	Each one ... in formation,
c60513	marches
c60514	not swerving from the course.
c60516	one another;
c60517	They do not jostle
c60518	each man proceeds in his column,
c60519	as they burst through the defenses,
c60520	never breaking ranks.
c60521	They storm the city;
c60522	they run along the wall;
c60523	they climb into houses,
c60524	entering through windows like thieves.
c60525	Before them the earth quakes;
c60526	the heavens tremble.
c60527	The sun and moon grow dark,
c60528	and the stars lose their brightness.
c60529	The LORD raises His voice in the presence of His army.
c60530	Indeed, His camp is very large,
c60531	for mighty [are] those who obey His command.
c60532	For the day of the LORD [is] great
c60533	and very dreadful.
c60534	Who can endure it?
c60535	Yet even now,
c60536	declares the LORD,
c60537	return to Me with all your heart,
c60538	with fasting, weeping, and mourning.
c60539	So rend your hearts
c60540	and not your garments,
c60541	and return to the LORD your God.
c60542	For He is gracious and compassionate,
c60543	slow to anger, and abounding in loving devotion.
c60544	And He relents from sending disaster.
c60545	Who knows?
c60546	He may turn
c60547	and relent
c60548	and leave a blessing behind Him— grain and drink offerings to the LORD your God.
c60549	Blow the trumpet in Zion,
c60550	consecrate a fast,
c60551	proclaim a sacred assembly.
c60552	Gather the people,
c60553	sanctify the congregation,
c60554	assemble the aged,
c60555	gather the children, even those nursing at the breast.
c60556	Let the bridegroom leave his room,
c60557	and the bride her chamber.
c60558	Let the priests who minister before the LORD weep between the porch and the altar,
c60559	saying,
c60560	“Spare
c60561	O LORD,
c60562	Your people,
c60563	and do not make Your heritage a reproach,
c60564	an object of scorn among the nations.
c60565	Why should they say among the peoples,
c60566	‘Where is their God?’”
c60567	Then the LORD became jealous for His land
c60568	and spared His people.
c60569	And the LORD answered
c60570	His people:
c60571	“Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and oil.
c60572	And by them you will be satisfied
c60573	and I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.
c60574	But the northern [army] I will remove far from you,
c60575	banishing it to a barren and desolate land,
c60576	its front ranks into the eastern sea,
c60577	and its rear guard into the western sea.
c60578	And its stench will rise;
c60579	its foul odor will go up.
c60580	For ... great things.
c60581	He has done
c60582	Do not be afraid,
c60583	O land;
c60584	rejoice
c60585	and be glad,
c60586	for the LORD ... great things.
c60587	has done
c60588	Do not be afraid,
c60589	O beasts of the field,
c60590	for the open pastures have turned green,
c60591	the trees bear their fruit,
c60592	and the fig tree and vine yield to their fullest.
c60594	O children of Zion,
c60595	Be glad,
c60596	and rejoice in the LORD your God,
c60597	for He has given you the autumn rains for your vindication.
c60598	He sends you showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before.
c60599	The threshing floors will be full of grain,
c60600	and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
c60601	I will repay you for the years
c60602	that the swarming locusts have eaten— the young locust, the destroying locust, and the devouring locust— My great army
c60603	that I sent against you.
c60604	You will have plenty to eat,
c60606	until you are satisfied.
c60607	You will praise the name of the LORD your God,
c60608	who has worked ... for you.
c60609	wonders
c60610	My people will never again be put to shame.
c60611	Then you will know
c60612	that I am present in Israel
c60613	and that I am the LORD your God,
c60614	and there is no other.
c60615	My people will never again be put to shame.
c60616	And afterward,
c60617	I will pour out My Spirit on all people.
c60618	Your sons and daughters will prophesy,
c60619	your old men will dream dreams,
c60620	your young men will see visions.
c60621	Even on [My] menservants and maidservants, I will pour out My Spirit in those days.
c60622	I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth,
c60623	blood and fire and columns of smoke.
c60624	The sun will be turned to darkness
c60625	and the moon to blood
c60626	before the coming of the great and awesome day of the LORD.
c60627	And
c60628	everyone
c60629	who calls on the name of the LORD
c60630	will be saved,
c60631	for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance,
c60632	as the LORD promised,
c60633	among the remnant
c60634	called by the LORD.
c60635	Yes, in those days and at that time,
c60636	when I restore from captivity Judah and Jerusalem,
c60637	I will gather all the nations
c60638	and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.
c60639	There I will enter into judgment against them concerning My people, My inheritance, Israel,
c60640	whom they have scattered among the nations
c60641	as they divided up My land.
c60642	They cast lots for My people;
c60643	they bartered a boy for a prostitute
c60644	and sold a girl for wine
c60645	to drink.
c60646	Now what have you against Me,
c60647	O Tyre, Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia—
c60648	are you rendering Me a recompense?
c60649	But if you retaliate against Me,
c60650	I will swiftly and speedily return retribution on your heads.
c60651	For you took My silver and gold
c60652	and carried off My finest treasures to your temples.
c60653	You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks,
c60654	to send them far from their homeland.
c60655	Behold, I will rouse them from the places
c60656	to which you sold them;
c60657	I will return retribution on your heads.
c60658	I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the people of Judah,
c60659	and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a distant nation.”
c60660	Indeed, the LORD has spoken.
c60661	Proclaim this among the nations:
c60662	“Prepare for war;
c60663	rouse the mighty men;
c60664	advance
c60665	let all the men of war ... and attack!
c60666	Beat your plowshares into swords
c60667	and your pruning hooks into spears.
c60668	Let the weak say,
c60669	‘I [am] strong!’
c60670	quickly,
c60671	Come
c60672	all you nations on every side
c60673	and gather yourselves.
c60674	Bring down
c60675	O LORD.
c60676	Your mighty ones,
c60677	be roused
c60678	Let the nations ... and advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
c60679	for there I will sit down
c60680	to judge all the nations on every side.
c60681	Swing the sickle,
c60682	for the harvest is ripe.
c60683	Come,
c60684	trample the grapes,
c60685	for the winepress is full;
c60686	the wine vats overflow
c60687	because their wickedness is great.
c60688	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!
c60689	For the Day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
c60690	The sun and moon grow dark,
c60691	and the stars no longer shine.
c60692	The LORD will roar from Zion
c60693	and raise His voice from Jerusalem;
c60694	heaven and earth will tremble.
c60695	But the LORD will be a refuge for His people,
c60696	a stronghold for the people of Israel.
c60697	Then you will know
c60698	that I am the LORD your God,
c60699	who dwells in Zion, My holy mountain.
c60700	Jerusalem will be holy,
c60701	never again to be overrun by foreigners.
c60702	And in that day
c60703	the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
c60704	and the hills will flow with milk.
c60705	All the streams of Judah will run with water,
c60706	and a spring will flow from the house of the LORD
c60707	to water the Valley of Acacias.
c60708	Egypt will become desolate,
c60709	and Edom a desert wasteland,
c60710	because of the violence done to the people of Judah,
c60711	in whose land they shed innocent blood.
c60712	But Judah will be inhabited forever,
c60713	and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
c60714	For I will acquit their bloodguilt
c60715	which I have not yet acquitted.”
c60716	For the LORD dwells in Zion.
c60717	[These are] the words of Amos,
c60718	who was among the sheepherders of Tekoa—
c60719	what he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, in the days [when] Uzziah [was] king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash [was] king of Israel.
c60720	He said:
c60721	“The LORD roars from Zion
c60722	and raises His voice from Jerusalem;
c60723	the pastures of the shepherds mourn,
c60724	and the summit of Carmel withers.”
c60725	This is what the LORD says:
c60726	“For three transgressions of Damascus, even four, I will not revoke [My judgment],
c60727	because they threshed Gilead with sledges of iron.
c60728	So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael
c60729	to consume the citadels of Ben-hadad.
c60730	I will break down the gates of Damascus
c60731	and cut off the ruler of the Valley of Aven
c60732	and him who wields the scepter from Beth-eden.
c60733	The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir,”
c60734	says the LORD.
c60735	This is what the LORD says:
c60736	“For three transgressions of Gaza, even four, I will not revoke [My judgment],
c60737	because they exiled a whole population
c60738	to deliver [them] up to Edom.
c60739	So I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza,
c60740	to consume its citadels.
c60741	I will cut off the ruler from Ashdod
c60742	and him who wields the scepter from Ashkelon.
c60743	And I will turn My hand against Ekron,
c60744	and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,”
c60745	says the Lord GOD.
c60746	This is what the LORD says:
c60747	“For three transgressions of Tyre, even four, I will not revoke [My judgment],
c60748	because they delivered up a whole congregation of exiles to Edom
c60749	and broke a covenant of brotherhood.
c60750	So I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre,
c60751	to consume its citadels.”
c60752	This is what the LORD says:
c60753	“For three transgressions of Edom, even four, I will not revoke [My judgment],
c60754	because he pursued his brother with the sword
c60755	and stifled all compassion;
c60756	his anger raged continually,
c60757	and his fury
c60758	flamed incessantly.
c60759	So I will send fire upon Teman
c60760	to consume the citadels of Bozrah.”
c60761	This is what the LORD says:
c60762	“For three transgressions of the Ammonites, even four, I will not revoke [My judgment],
c60763	because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead
c60764	in order to enlarge their territory.
c60765	So I will kindle a fire in the walls of Rabbah
c60766	to consume its citadels
c60767	amid war cries on the day of battle
c60768	and a violent wind on the day of tempest.
c60769	Their king will go into exile—
c60770	he and his princes together,”
c60771	says the LORD.
c60772	This is what the LORD says:
c60773	“For three transgressions of Moab, even four, I will not revoke [My judgment],
c60774	because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.
c60775	So I will send fire against Moab
c60776	to consume the citadels of Kerioth.
c60777	Moab will die in tumult, amid war cries and the blast of the trumpet.
c60778	I will cut off the ruler from its midst
c60779	and kill all the officials with him,”
c60780	says the LORD.
c60781	This is what the LORD says:
c60782	“For three transgressions of Judah, even four, I will not revoke [My judgment],
c60783	because they have rejected the law of the LORD
c60784	and have not kept His statutes;
c60785	they have been led astray by the lies
c60786	in which their forefathers walked.
c60787	So I will send fire upon Judah
c60788	to consume the citadels of Jerusalem.”
c60789	This is what the LORD says:
c60790	“For three transgressions of Israel, even four, I will not revoke [My judgment],
c60791	because they sell the righteous for silver
c60792	and the needy for a pair of sandals.
c60793	They trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the earth;
c60794	they push the needy out of their way.
c60795	A man and his father resort to the same girl
c60796	and so profane My holy name.
c60797	They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge,
c60798	and in the house of their God, they drink the wine of the sanctioned.
c60799	Yet [it was] I who destroyed the Amorite before them,
c60800	though his height was like that of the cedars,
c60801	and he was as strong as the oaks;
c60802	yet I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below.
c60803	And I brought you up from the land of Egypt
c60804	and led you forty years in the wilderness,
c60805	that you might take possession of the land of the Amorite.
c60806	I raised up prophets from your sons
c60807	and Nazirites from your young men.
c60808	Is this not true,
c60809	O children of Israel?”
c60810	declares the LORD.
c60811	“But you made the Nazirites drink wine
c60812	and commanded the prophets
c60814	not to prophesy.
c60815	Behold, I am about to crush you in your place
c60816	as a wagonload ... crushes grain.
c60817	of sheaves
c60818	Escape will fail the swift,
c60819	the strong will not prevail by his strength,
c60820	and the mighty will not save his life.
c60821	The archer will not stand his ground,
c60822	the fleet of foot will not escape,
c60823	and the horseman will not save his life.
c60824	Even the bravest of mighty men will flee naked on that day,”
c60825	declares the LORD.
c60826	Hear this word
c60827	that the LORD has spoken against you,
c60828	O children of Israel,
c60829	against the entire clan
c60830	that I brought up out of Egypt:
c60832	“You only have I known from all the clans of the earth;
c60833	therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
c60834	Can two walk together
c60835	without an appointment to meet?
c60836	Does a lion roar in the forest
c60837	when he has no prey?
c60838	Does a young lion growl in his den
c60839	if he has caught nothing?
c60840	Does a bird land in a snare
c60841	where no bait [has been set]?
c60842	Does a trap spring from the ground
c60843	when it has nothing to catch?
c60844	If a trumpet sounds in a city,
c60845	will the people not tremble?
c60846	If calamity comes to a city,
c60847	has not the LORD caused it?
c60848	Surely the Lord GOD does nothing
c60849	without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.
c60850	The lion has roared—
c60851	who will not fear?
c60852	The Lord GOD has spoken—
c60853	who will not prophesy?
c60854	Proclaim to the citadels of Ashdod
c60855	as well as the citadels of Egypt:
c60857	‘Assemble on the mountains of Samaria;
c60858	see the great unrest in the city
c60859	and the acts of oppression in her midst.
c60860	For they know not
c60861	how to do right—
c60862	declares the LORD—
c60863	those who store up violence and destruction in their citadels.’”
c60864	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
c60865	“An enemy
c60866	will surround the land;
c60867	he will pull down your strongholds
c60868	and plunder your citadels.”
c60869	This is what the LORD says:
c60870	“As the shepherd snatches from the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear,
c60871	so the Israelites ... will be snatched away
c60872	dwelling in Samaria ... with the corner of a bed or the cushion of a couch.
c60873	Hear
c60874	and testify against the house of Jacob,
c60875	declares the Lord GOD, the God of Hosts.
c60876	On the day
c60877	I punish Israel for their transgressions,
c60878	I will visit [destruction] on the altars of Bethel;
c60879	the horns of the altar will be cut off,
c60880	and they will fall to the ground.
c60881	I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house;
c60882	the houses of ivory will also perish,
c60883	and the mansions will come to an end,”
c60884	declares the LORD.
c60885	Hear this word,
c60886	you cows of Bashan
c60887	on Mount Samaria,
c60888	you women who oppress the poor
c60889	and crush the needy,
c60890	who say to your husbands,
c60891	“Bring us
c60892	more to drink.”
c60893	The Lord GOD has sworn by His holiness:
c60894	“Behold, the days are coming
c60895	when you will be taken away with hooks,
c60896	and your posterity with fishhooks.
c60897	You will go out [through] broken [walls],
c60898	each one straight ahead of her,
c60899	and you will be cast out toward Harmon,”
c60900	declares the LORD.
c60901	“Go to Bethel
c60902	and transgress; ... at Gilgal!
c60903	even more
c60904	rebel
c60905	Bring your sacrifices every morning,
c60906	your tithes every three days.
c60907	Offer leavened bread as a thank offering,
c60908	and loudly ... your freewill offerings,
c60909	proclaim
c60910	for that is what ... love to do!”
c60911	[you] children of Israel
c60912	declares the LORD GOD.
c60913	“I beset all your cities with cleanness of teeth
c60914	and all your towns with lack of bread,
c60915	yet you did not return to Me.”
c60916	declares the LORD.
c60917	“I also withheld the rain from you when the harvest was three months away.
c60918	I sent rain on one city
c60919	but withheld [it] from another.
c60920	One field received rain
c60921	while [one]
c60922	without rain
c60923	withered.
c60924	People staggered from city to city
c60925	for water to drink,
c60926	but they were not satisfied;
c60927	yet you have not returned to Me,”
c60928	declares the LORD.
c60929	“I struck you with blight and mildew
c60930	in your growing gardens and vineyards;
c60931	the locust devoured your fig and olive trees,
c60932	yet you did not return to Me,”
c60933	declares the LORD.
c60934	“I sent plagues among you like those of Egypt;
c60935	I killed your young men with the sword,
c60936	along with your captured horses.
c60937	I filled ... with the stench of your camp,
c60938	your nostrils
c60939	yet you did not return to Me,”
c60940	declares the LORD.
c60941	“Some of you I overthrew as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,
c60942	and you were like a firebrand
c60943	snatched from a blaze,
c60944	yet you did not return to Me,”
c60945	declares the LORD.
c60946	“Therefore,
c60947	that is what I will do to you,
c60948	O Israel,
c60949	and since I will do this to you,
c60950	prepare
c60951	to meet your God,
c60952	O Israel!
c60953	For behold,
c60954	He who forms the mountains,
c60955	who creates the wind,
c60956	and reveals ... to man,
c60957	His thoughts
c60958	the One who turns the dawn to darkness
c60959	and strides on the heights of the earth,
c60960	the LORD, the God of Hosts, is His name.”
c60961	Hear this word,
c60962	this ... I take up against you:
c60963	lamentation
c60964	O house of Israel,
c60965	“Fallen is
c60966	never ... again.
c60967	to rise
c60968	Virgin Israel,
c60969	She lies abandoned on her land,
c60970	with no one to raise her up.”
c60971	This is what the Lord GOD says:
c60972	“The city
c60973	that marches out a thousand strong
c60974	will only see a hundred return,
c60976	and the one that marches out a hundred strong
c60977	will have but ten left in the house of Israel.”
c60978	For this is what the LORD says to the house of Israel:
c60979	“Seek
c60980	Me and live!
c60981	Do not seek Bethel
c60982	or go to Gilgal; do not
c60983	journey to Beersheba,
c60984	for Gilgal will surely go into exile,
c60985	and Bethel will come to nothing.
c60986	Seek the LORD
c60987	and live,
c60988	or He will spread like fire through the house of Joseph;
c60989	it will devour everything,
c60990	with no one at Bethel to extinguish it.
c60991	You who turn justice into wormwood
c60992	and cast righteousness to the ground—
c60993	He who made the Pleiades and Orion,
c60994	who turns darkness into dawn
c60995	and darkens day into night,
c60996	who summons the waters of the sea
c60997	and pours them over the face of the earth,
c60998	the LORD is His name.
c60999	He flashes destruction on the strong,
c61000	so that fury comes upon the stronghold—
c61001	you hate
c61002	the one who reproves in the gate
c61004	him who speaks with integrity.
c61005	and despise
c61006	Therefore,
c61007	because you trample on the poor
c61008	and exact from him a tax of grain,
c61009	in the stone houses you have built;
c61010	you will never live
c61011	from the lush vineyards you have planted.
c61012	you will never drink the wine
c61013	For I know
c61014	your transgressions are many
c61015	and your sins are innumerable.
c61016	You oppress the righteous,
c61017	taking bribes,
c61018	and depriving the poor of justice at the gates.
c61019	Therefore, the prudent keep silent in such times,
c61020	for the days are evil.
c61021	Seek good,
c61022	not evil
c61023	so that you may live,
c61024	and the LORD, the God of Hosts, will be with you,
c61025	as you have claimed.
c61026	Hate evil
c61027	and love good;
c61028	establish justice in the gate.
c61029	Perhaps the LORD, the God of Hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.”
c61030	Therefore
c61031	this is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the Lord, says:
c61032	“There will be wailing in all the public squares
c61033	and cries of ... in all the streets.
c61034	‘Alas, alas’
c61035	The farmer will be summoned to mourn,
c61036	and the mourners to wail.
c61037	There will be wailing in all the vineyards,
c61038	for I will pass through your midst,”
c61039	says the LORD.
c61040	Woe
c61041	to you who long for the Day of the LORD!
c61042	What will the Day of the LORD be for you?
c61043	It [will be] darkness
c61044	and not light.
c61045	It will be like a man who flees from a lion
c61046	only to encounter a bear,
c61047	or who enters his house
c61048	and rests his hand against the wall,
c61049	only to have a serpent bite him.
c61050	Will not the Day of the LORD be darkness
c61051	and not light,
c61052	even gloom
c61053	with no brightness in it?
c61054	I hate,
c61055	I despise your feasts!
c61056	I cannot stand the stench of your solemn assemblies.
c61057	Even
c61058	though you offer Me burnt offerings and grain offerings,
c61059	I will not accept them;
c61060	for your peace offerings of fattened cattle, I will have no regard.
c61061	Take away from Me the noise of your songs!
c61062	I will not listen to the music of your harps.
c61063	But let justice roll on like a river,
c61064	and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
c61065	Did you bring Me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness,
c61066	O house of Israel?
c61067	You have lifted up Sakkuth your king and Kaiwan your star god, the idols
c61068	you made for yourselves.
c61069	Therefore , I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,”
c61070	says the LORD,
c61071	whose name [is] the God of Hosts.
c61072	Woe
c61073	to those at ease in Zion
c61074	and those secure on Mount Samaria,
c61075	the distinguished ones of the foremost nation,
c61076	to whom the house of Israel comes.
c61077	Cross over to Calneh
c61078	and see;
c61079	go from there to great Hamath;
c61080	then go down to Gath of the Philistines.
c61081	Are you better than these kingdoms?
c61082	Is their territory larger than yours?
c61083	You dismiss the day of calamity
c61084	and bring near a reign of violence.
c61085	You lie on beds inlaid with ivory,
c61086	and lounge upon your couches;
c61087	You dine on lambs from the flock and calves from the stall.
c61088	You improvise songs on the harp
c61089	like David and invent your own musical instruments.
c61090	You drink wine by the bowlful
c61091	and anoint yourselves with the finest oils,
c61092	but you fail to grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
c61093	Therefore,
c61094	you will now go into exile as the first of the captives,
c61095	and your feasting and lounging will come to an end.
c61096	The Lord GOD has sworn by Himself—
c61097	the LORD, the God of Hosts, has declared:
c61098	“I abhor Jacob’s pride
c61099	and detest his citadels,
c61100	so I will deliver up the city and everything in it.”
c61101	there are
c61102	And if ... ten men left in one house,
c61103	they too will die.
c61104	And when the relative ... picks them up
c61105	who is to burn [the bodies]
c61106	to remove them from the house,
c61107	he will call
c61108	to one inside of the house,
c61109	“Is anyone else with you?”
c61110	that person will answer.
c61111	“None,”
c61112	[the relative] will reply,
c61113	“Silence,”
c61114	“for ... must not
c61115	the name of the LORD ... be invoked.”
c61116	For
c61117	the LORD gives a command:
c61118	“The great house will be smashed to pieces,
c61119	and the small house to rubble.”
c61120	“Do horses gallop on the cliffs?
c61121	Does one plow [the sea] with oxen?
c61122	But you have turned justice into poison
c61123	and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood—
c61124	you who rejoice ‘Did we not over Lo-debar
c61125	and say,
c61126	take Karnaim by our own strength?’
c61127	For behold, I will raise up ... against you,
c61128	O house of Israel,”
c61129	declares the LORD, the God of Hosts,
c61130	a nation
c61131	“and they will oppress you
c61132	from Lebo-hamath
c61133	to the Brook of the Arabah.”
c61134	This is what the Lord GOD showed me:
c61135	He was preparing swarms of locusts ... was coming up.
c61136	as the late spring crop
c61137	just after the king's harvest,
c61138	And
c61139	when the locusts had
c61140	eaten every green plant in the land,
c61141	I said,
c61142	“Lord GOD,
c61143	please forgive!
c61144	How will Jacob survive,
c61145	since he is so small?”
c61146	So the LORD relented from this [plan].
c61147	“It will not happen,”
c61148	[He] said.
c61149	This is what the Lord GOD showed me:
c61150	was calling
c61151	for judgment by fire.
c61152	The Lord GOD
c61153	It consumed the great deep
c61154	and devoured the land.
c61155	Then I said,
c61156	“Lord GOD,
c61157	please stop!
c61158	How will Jacob survive,
c61159	since he is so small?”
c61160	So the LORD relented from this [plan].
c61161	“It will not happen either,”
c61162	said the Lord GOD.
c61163	This is what He showed me:
c61164	Behold, the Lord was standing by a wall true to plumb,
c61165	with a plumb line in His hand.
c61166	asked the LORD.
c61167	what do you see?”
c61168	“Amos,
c61169	I replied.
c61170	“A plumb line,”
c61171	said the Lord,
c61172	“Behold,” ... “I am setting a plumb line among My people Israel;
c61173	I will no longer
c61174	spare them:
c61175	The high places of Isaac will be deserted,
c61176	and the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste;
c61177	and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with My sword.”
c61178	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel,
c61179	saying,
c61180	“Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel.
c61181	The land cannot
c61182	bear all his words,
c61183	for this is what Amos has said:
c61184	‘Jeroboam will die by the sword,
c61185	and Israel will surely go into exile, away from her homeland.’”
c61186	And Amaziah said to Amos,
c61187	you seer!
c61188	“Go away,
c61189	Flee to the land of Judah;
c61190	earn your bread ... there,
c61191	there and do your prophesying
c61192	but never ... at Bethel again,
c61193	prophesy
c61194	because it [is] the sanctuary of the king
c61195	and the temple of the kingdom.”
c61196	Amos replied,
c61198	“I was not a prophet,”
c61199	“[nor was I] the son of a prophet; ... I
c61200	rather, ... was a herdsman [and] a tender of sycamore-fig trees.
c61201	But the LORD took me from following the flock
c61202	and said to me,
c61203	‘Go,
c61204	prophesy to My people Israel.’
c61205	Now, therefore,
c61206	hear the word of the LORD.
c61207	You say:
c61208	‘Do not prophesy against Israel;
c61209	do not preach against the house of Isaac.’
c61210	Therefore, this is what the LORD says:
c61211	‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city,
c61212	and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword.
c61213	Your land will be divided by a measuring line,
c61214	and you yourself will die on pagan soil.
c61215	And Israel will surely go into exile, away from her homeland.’”
c61216	This is what the Lord GOD showed me:
c61217	I saw a basket of summer fruit.
c61218	He asked.
c61219	what do you see?”
c61220	“Amos,
c61221	I replied.
c61222	“A basket of summer fruit,”
c61223	So the LORD said to me,
c61224	“The end has come for My people Israel;
c61225	I will no longer
c61226	spare them.”
c61227	“In that day,” ... “the songs of the temple will turn to wailing.
c61228	declares the Lord GOD,
c61229	Many [will be] the corpses,
c61230	strewn ... everywhere!”
c61231	in silence
c61232	Hear this,
c61233	you who trample on the needy,
c61234	who do away with the poor of the land,
c61235	asking,
c61236	“When will the New Moon be over
c61237	that we may sell grain?
c61238	When will the Sabbath [end],
c61239	that we may market wheat?
c61240	Let us reduce the ephah
c61241	and increase the shekel;
c61242	let us cheat with dishonest scales.
c61243	Let us buy the poor with silver
c61244	and the needy for a pair of sandals,
c61245	selling even the chaff with the wheat!”
c61246	The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob:
c61247	“I will never forget any of their deeds.
c61248	Will not the land quake for this
c61249	and all ... mourn?
c61250	its dwellers
c61251	All of it will swell like the Nile;
c61252	it will surge
c61253	and then subside like the Nile in Egypt.”
c61254	“And in that day,”
c61255	declares the Lord GOD,
c61256	“I will make the sun go down at noon;
c61257	and I will darken the earth in the daytime.
c61258	I will turn your feasts into mourning
c61259	and all your songs into lamentation.
c61260	I will cause everyone to wear sackcloth
c61261	and every head to be shaved.
c61262	I will make it like a time of mourning for an only son,
c61263	and its outcome like a bitter day.
c61264	Behold! The days are coming,”
c61265	declares the Lord GOD,
c61266	“when I will send a famine on the land—
c61267	not a famine of bread
c61268	or a thirst for water,
c61269	but [a famine] of hearing the words of the LORD.
c61270	People will stagger from sea to sea
c61271	and roam from north to east,
c61272	seeking the word of the LORD,
c61273	but they will not find it.
c61274	In that day the lovely young women, the young men as well, will faint from thirst.
c61275	Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria
c61276	and say,
c61277	‘As surely as your god lives,
c61278	O Dan,’
c61279	or, ‘As surely as the Way of Beersheba lives’—
c61280	they will fall,
c61281	never to rise again.”
c61282	I saw the Lord
c61283	standing beside the altar,
c61284	and He said:
c61285	“Strike the tops of the pillars
c61286	so that the thresholds shake.
c61287	Topple them on the heads of all the people,
c61288	and I will kill the rest with the sword.
c61289	None of those who flee will get away;
c61290	none of the fugitives will escape.
c61291	Though they dig down to Sheol,
c61292	from there My hand will take them;
c61293	and though they climb up to heaven,
c61294	from there I will pull them down.
c61295	Though they hide themselves atop Carmel,
c61296	there I will track them
c61297	and seize them;
c61298	and though they hide from Me at the bottom of the sea,
c61299	there I will command the serpent
c61300	to bite them.
c61301	Though they are driven by their enemies into captivity,
c61302	there I will command the sword
c61303	to slay them.
c61304	I will fix My eyes upon them for harm
c61305	and not for good.”
c61306	The Lord, the GOD of Hosts,
c61307	He who touches the earth
c61308	and melts it,
c61309	and all ... mourn—
c61310	its dwellers
c61311	all [the land] rises like the Nile,
c61312	then sinks like the river of Egypt—
c61313	He builds His upper rooms in the heavens
c61314	and founds His vault upon the earth.
c61315	He summons the waters of the sea
c61316	and pours them over the face of the earth.
c61317	The LORD is His name.
c61318	“Are you not like the Cushites to Me,
c61319	O children of Israel?”
c61320	declares the LORD.
c61321	“Did I not bring Israel up from the land of Egypt,
c61322	the Philistines from Caphtor,
c61323	and the Arameans from Kir?
c61324	Surely the eyes of the Lord GOD are on the sinful kingdom,
c61325	and I will destroy it from the face of the earth.
c61326	Yet I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,”
c61327	declares the LORD.
c61328	“For surely I will give the command,
c61329	and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations,
c61330	as [grain] is sifted in a sieve,
c61331	but not a pebble will reach the ground.
c61332	All the sinners among My people will die by the sword,
c61333	all those who say,
c61334	will never draw near
c61335	‘Disaster ... or confront us.’
c61336	“In that day I will restore ... tent of David.
c61337	the fallen
c61338	I will repair its gaps,
c61339	restore its ruins,
c61340	and rebuild it as in the days of old,
c61341	so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations
c61342	that bear My name,”
c61343	declares the LORD,
c61344	who will do this.
c61345	“Behold, the days are coming,
c61346	declares the LORD,
c61347	when the plowman will overtake the reaper
c61348	and the treader of grapes, the sower of seed.
c61349	The mountains will drip with sweet wine,
c61350	with which all the hills will flow.
c61351	I will restore from captivity My people Israel;
c61352	they will rebuild ... the ruined cities;
c61353	and inhabit
c61354	they will plant vineyards
c61355	and drink their wine;
c61356	they will make gardens
c61357	and eat their fruit.
c61358	I will firmly plant them on their own land,
c61359	and they will never again be uprooted from the land
c61360	I have given them,”
c61361	says the LORD your God.
c61362	[This is] the vision of Obadiah:
c61363	This is what the Lord ... says about Edom— ... from the LORD;
c61364	GOD ... We have heard a message
c61365	an envoy has been sent among the nations
c61366	[to say,] “Rise up,
c61367	and let us go to battle against her!”
c61368	“Behold, I will make you small among the nations;
c61369	you will be deeply despised.
c61370	The pride of your heart has deceived you—
c61371	O dwellers in the clefts of the rocks
c61372	whose habitation is the heights,
c61373	who say in your heart,
c61374	‘Who can bring me down to the ground?’
c61375	Though you soar like the eagle
c61376	and make your nest among the stars,
c61377	even from there I will bring you down,”
c61378	declares the LORD.
c61379	“If thieves came to you,
c61380	if robbers by night—
c61381	oh, how you will be ruined—
c61382	would they not steal [only] what they wanted?
c61383	If grape pickers came to you,
c61384	would they not leave [some] gleanings?
c61385	But how Esau will be pillaged,
c61386	his hidden treasures sought out!
c61387	All the men allied with you will drive you to the border;
c61388	will deceive
c61389	those at peace with you ... and overpower you. Those who eat
c61390	your bread will set a trap for you,
c61391	without your awareness of it.
c61392	In that day, ... will I not
c61393	declares the LORD,
c61394	destroy the wise [men] of Edom
c61395	and the men of understanding in the mountains of Esau?
c61396	Then your mighty men, ... will be terrified,
c61397	O Teman,
c61398	so that everyone in the mountains of Esau will be cut down in the slaughter.
c61399	Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame
c61400	and cut off forever.
c61401	On the day
c61402	you stood aloof
c61403	while
c61404	strangers carried off his wealth
c61405	and foreigners entered his gate
c61406	and cast lots for Jerusalem,
c61407	you were just like one of them.
c61408	But you should not gloat in that day, your brother's day of misfortune,
c61409	nor rejoice over the people of Judah in the day
c61410	of their destruction,
c61411	nor boast proudly in the day of their distress.
c61412	You should not enter the gate of My people in the day of their disaster,
c61413	nor gloat over their affliction in the day of their disaster,
c61414	nor loot their wealth in the day of their disaster.
c61415	Nor should you stand at the crossroads
c61416	to cut off their fugitives,
c61417	nor deliver up their survivors in the day of their distress.
c61418	For the Day of the LORD is near for all the nations.
c61419	As you have done,
c61420	it will be done to you;
c61421	your recompense will return upon your own head.
c61422	For
c61423	as you have drunk on My holy hill,
c61424	so all the nations will drink continually.
c61425	They will drink
c61426	and gulp down,
c61427	and be
c61428	as if they had never been.
c61429	But on Mount Zion there will be deliverance,
c61430	and it will be holy,
c61431	and the house of Jacob will reclaim their possession.
c61432	Then the house of Jacob will be a blazing fire,
c61433	and the house of Joseph a burning flame;
c61434	but the house of Esau will be stubble—
c61435	Jacob will set it ablaze
c61436	and consume it.
c61437	Therefore no survivor will remain from the house of Esau.”
c61438	For the LORD has spoken.
c61439	Those from the Negev will possess the mountains of Esau;
c61440	those from the foothills [will possess the land] of the Philistines.
c61441	They will occupy the fields of Ephraim and Samaria,
c61442	and Benjamin [will possess] Gilead.
c61443	And the exiles of this host of the Israelites
c61444	[will possess the land] of the Canaanites
c61445	as far as Zarephath;
c61446	and the exiles from Jerusalem
c61447	who are in Sepharad
c61448	will possess the cities of the Negev.
c61449	The deliverers will ascend Mount Zion
c61450	to rule over the mountains of Esau.
c61451	And the kingdom will belong to the LORD.
c61452	Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai,
c61453	saying,
c61454	“Arise!
c61455	Go to the great city of Nineveh
c61456	and preach against it,
c61457	because its wickedness has come up before Me.”
c61458	Jonah, however, got up
c61459	and fled to Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD.
c61460	He went down to Joppa
c61461	and found a ship
c61462	bound for Tarshish.
c61463	So he paid the fare
c61464	and went aboard
c61465	to sail for Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD.
c61466	Then the LORD hurled a violent wind upon the sea,
c61467	and such a violent storm arose
c61468	that the ship was in danger
c61469	of breaking apart.
c61470	The sailors were afraid,
c61471	cried out
c61472	and each ... to his own god.
c61473	And they threw ... cargo
c61474	the ship’s
c61475	into the sea
c61476	to lighten the load.
c61477	But Jonah had gone down to the lowest part of the vessel,
c61478	where he lay down
c61479	and fell into a deep sleep.
c61480	The captain approached
c61481	him and said,
c61482	“How can you
c61483	sleep?
c61484	Get up
c61485	[and] call upon your God.
c61486	Perhaps this God will consider us,
c61487	so that we may not perish.”
c61488	said the sailors
c61489	to one another.
c61490	“Come!”
c61491	“Let us cast lots
c61492	to find out
c61493	who is responsible for this calamity that is upon us.”
c61494	So they cast lots,
c61495	and the lot fell on Jonah.
c61496	they demanded,
c61497	“Tell us now,”
c61498	“who is to blame for this calamity that is upon us?
c61499	What [is] your occupation,
c61500	and from where have you come?
c61501	What is your country,
c61502	and who are your people?”
c61503	replied Jonah.
c61504	“I am a Hebrew,”
c61505	“I worship the LORD, the God of the heavens,
c61506	who made the sea and the dry land.”
c61507	Then the men were even more afraid
c61508	and said to him,
c61509	“What have you done?”
c61510	The men knew ... because
c61511	that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD,
c61512	he had told them.
c61513	so they said to [Jonah],
c61514	“What must we do to you
c61515	to calm this sea for us?”
c61516	Now the sea was growing worse
c61517	and worse,
c61518	he answered,
c61519	“Pick me up,”
c61520	“and cast me into the sea,
c61521	so it may quiet down for you.
c61522	For I know
c61523	that I am to blame for this violent storm that has come upon you.”
c61524	Nevertheless, the men rowed hard
c61525	to get back to dry land,
c61526	but they could not,
c61527	for the sea ... them more and more.
c61528	was raging against
c61529	So they cried out to the LORD:
c61531	“Please, O LORD,
c61532	do not let us perish on account of this man's life!
c61533	Do not charge us with innocent blood!
c61534	For You,
c61535	O LORD,
c61536	as You pleased.”
c61537	have done
c61538	At this, they picked up Jonah
c61539	and threw him into the sea,
c61540	and the raging sea grew calm.
c61541	Then the men feared the LORD greatly,
c61542	and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD
c61543	and made vows [to Him].
c61544	Now the LORD had appointed a great fish
c61545	to swallow Jonah,
c61546	and Jonah spent three days and three nights in the stomach of the fish.
c61547	From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God,
c61548	saying:
c61549	“In my distress I called to the LORD
c61550	and He answered me.
c61551	From the belly of Sheol I called for help,
c61552	[and] You heard my voice.
c61553	For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas,
c61554	and the current swirled about me.
c61555	All Your breakers and waves swept over me.
c61556	At this, I said,
c61557	‘I have been banished from Your sight;
c61558	yet ... once more
c61559	I will look ... toward Your holy temple.’
c61560	The waters engulfed me up to the neck;
c61561	the watery depths overcame me;
c61562	the seaweed wrapped around my head.
c61563	To the roots of the mountains I descended;
c61564	the earth
c61565	beneath me barred me in forever!
c61566	But You raised my life from the pit,
c61567	O LORD my God!
c61568	As my life was fading away,
c61569	I remembered the LORD.
c61570	My prayer went up to You, to Your holy temple.
c61571	Those who cling to worthless idols
c61572	forsake [His] loving devotion.
c61573	But I,
c61574	with the voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You.
c61575	what I have vowed.
c61576	I will fulfill
c61577	Salvation is from the LORD!”
c61578	And the LORD commanded the fish,
c61579	and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
c61580	Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time:
c61582	“Arise!
c61583	Go to the great city of Nineveh
c61584	and proclaim the message
c61585	that I will give you.”
c61586	This time Jonah got up
c61587	and went to Nineveh in accordance with the word of the LORD.
c61588	Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city,
c61589	a three-day journey [to cross].
c61590	Jonah set out
c61591	On the first day of his walk, ... into the city
c61592	and proclaimed,
c61594	“Forty more days
c61595	and Nineveh will be overturned!”
c61596	vvv And the Ninevites believed God.
c61597	They proclaimed a fast
c61598	and dressed in sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least.
c61599	When word reached the king of Nineveh,
c61600	he got up from his throne,
c61601	took off his royal robe, ... in
c61602	covered [himself] with sackcloth,
c61603	and sat ... ashes.
c61604	Then he issued a proclamation
c61606	in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles:
c61608	Let no man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything at all.
c61609	They must not eat
c61610	or drink.
c61611	Furthermore, let both man and beast be covered with sackcloth,
c61612	and have everyone call out earnestly to God.
c61613	turn
c61614	Let each one ... from his evil ways and from the violence
c61615	in his hands.
c61616	Who knows?
c61617	may turn
c61618	God ... and relent;
c61619	He may turn from His fierce anger,
c61620	so that we will not perish.”
c61621	When God saw their actions—
c61622	that they had turned from their evil ways—
c61623	[He] relented from the disaster
c61624	He had threatened
c61625	to bring upon them.
c61627	Jonah, however, was greatly displeased,
c61628	and became angry.
c61629	So he prayed to the LORD,
c61630	saying,
c61631	“O LORD,
c61632	is this not what I said
c61633	while I was still in my own country?
c61634	This is why I was so quick
c61635	to flee toward Tarshish.
c61636	I knew that
c61637	You [are] a gracious and compassionate God,
c61638	slow to anger,
c61639	abounding in loving devotion—
c61640	One who relents from sending disaster.
c61641	And now, O LORD,
c61642	please take my life from me,
c61643	for it is better for me to die than to live.”
c61644	But the LORD replied,
c61645	any right
c61646	“Have you ... to be angry?”
c61647	Then Jonah left the city
c61648	and sat down east of it,
c61649	[where] he made himself a shelter
c61650	and sat in its shade
c61651	to see
c61652	what would happen to the city.
c61653	So the LORD God appointed a vine,
c61654	and it grew up ... over Jonah’s
c61655	to provide shade ... head ... with
c61656	to ease his discomfort,
c61657	and Jonah was greatly pleased ... the plant.
c61658	God appointed a worm
c61659	When dawn came the next day,
c61660	that attacked the plant
c61661	so that it withered.
c61663	As the sun was rising,
c61664	God appointed a scorching east wind,
c61665	and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head
c61666	so that he grew faint
c61667	and wished
c61668	to die,
c61669	saying,
c61670	“It is better for me to die than to live.”
c61671	Then God asked Jonah,
c61672	any right
c61673	“Have you ... to be angry about the plant?”
c61674	he replied.
c61675	“I do,”
c61676	“I am angry enough to die!”
c61677	But the LORD said,
c61678	“You cared about the plant,
c61679	which you neither tended
c61680	nor made grow.
c61681	It sprang up in a night
c61682	and perished in a night.
c61683	So should I
c61684	not care about the great city of Nineveh,
c61685	which has
c61686	more than 120,000 people
c61687	who cannot tell their right hand from their left,
c61688	and many cattle as well?”
c61689	[This is] the word of the LORD
c61690	that came to Micah the Moreshite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—
c61691	what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem:
c61692	Hear,
c61693	O peoples, all of you;
c61694	listen,
c61695	O earth, and everyone in it!
c61696	The Lord GOD will witness against you,
c61697	the Lord from His holy temple.
c61698	For behold, the LORD comes forth out of His dwelling place;
c61699	He will come down
c61700	and tread on the high places of the earth.
c61701	The mountains will melt beneath Him,
c61702	and the valleys will split apart,
c61703	like wax before the fire,
c61704	like water cascading down a slope.
c61705	All this [is] for the transgression of Jacob
c61706	and the sins of the house of Israel.
c61707	What [is] the transgression of Jacob?
c61708	Is it not Samaria?
c61709	And what is the high place of Judah?
c61710	Is it not Jerusalem?
c61711	Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble in the open field, a planting area for a vineyard.
c61712	I will pour her stones into the valley
c61713	and expose her foundations.
c61714	All her carved images will be smashed to pieces;
c61715	all her wages will be burned in the fire,
c61716	and I will destroy all her idols.
c61717	Since she collected the wages of a prostitute,
c61718	they will be used again on a prostitute.
c61719	Because of this I will lament
c61720	and wail;
c61721	I will walk barefoot and naked.
c61722	I will howl like a jackal
c61723	and mourn like an ostrich.
c61724	For her wound is incurable;
c61725	it has reached even Judah;
c61726	it has approached the gate of my people, as far as Jerusalem itself.
c61727	Do not tell it in Gath;
c61728	do not weep at all.
c61729	Roll in the dust in Beth-leaphrah.
c61730	Depart
c61731	O residents of Shaphir.
c61732	in shameful nakedness,
c61733	The inhabitants of Zaanan will not come out.
c61734	Beth-ezel is in mourning;
c61735	its support is taken from you.
c61736	For the residents of Maroth pined for good,
c61737	but calamity came down from the LORD, even to the gate of Jerusalem.
c61738	Harness the horses to the chariot,
c61739	O inhabitant of Lachish.
c61740	You were the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion,
c61741	for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
c61742	Therefore, send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath;
c61743	the houses of Achzib [will] prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.
c61744	I will again bring a conqueror against you,
c61745	O inhabitant of Mareshah.
c61746	The glory of Israel will come to Adullam.
c61747	Shave yourselves bald
c61748	and cut off your hair in morning for your precious children;
c61749	make yourselves as bald as an eagle,
c61750	for they will go from you into exile.
c61751	Woe
c61752	to those who devise iniquity
c61753	and plot evil on their beds!
c61754	At morning's light they accomplish it
c61755	because the power is in their hands.
c61756	They covet fields
c61757	and seize them,
c61758	houses.
c61759	and they take away
c61760	They deprive a man of his home, a fellow man of his inheritance.
c61761	Therefore,
c61762	this is what the LORD says:
c61763	“I am planning against this nation a disaster
c61764	from which you cannot free your necks.
c61765	Then you will not walk so proudly,
c61766	for it will be a time of calamity.
c61767	In that day they will take up a taunt against you
c61768	and wail ... lamentation:
c61769	this bitter
c61771	‘We are utterly ruined;
c61772	He has changed the portion of my people!
c61773	How He has removed [it] from me;
c61774	He has allotted our fields to traitors!’”
c61775	Therefore,
c61776	you will have no one
c61777	to divide the land by lot.
c61778	in the assembly of the LORD
c61779	“Do not preach,”
c61780	they preach.
c61781	“Do not preach these things;
c61782	disgrace will not overtake us.”
c61783	Should it be said,
c61784	O house of Jacob,
c61785	“Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient?
c61786	Are these the things He does?”
c61787	Do not My words bring good
c61788	to him who walks uprightly?
c61789	But of late My people have risen up like an enemy:
c61790	You strip off the splendid robe
c61791	from unsuspecting passers-by like men returning from battle.
c61792	You drive the women of My people from their pleasant homes.
c61793	You take away My blessing from their children forever.
c61794	Arise
c61795	and depart,
c61796	for this is not your place of rest,
c61797	because its defilement
c61798	brings destruction—
c61799	a grievous destruction!
c61800	If a man ... were to come
c61801	of wind ... and say falsely,
c61802	“I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,”
c61803	he would be just the preacher for this people!
c61804	I will surely gather
c61805	O Jacob;
c61806	all of you,
c61807	I will collect the remnant of Israel.
c61808	I will bring them together like sheep in a pen,
c61809	like a flock in the midst of its pasture—
c61810	a noisy throng.
c61811	One who breaks open the way will go up before them;
c61812	they will break
c61813	through the gate,
c61814	and go out by it.
c61815	Their king will pass through before them,
c61816	the LORD as their leader.
c61817	Then I said:
c61818	“Hear now,
c61819	O leaders of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel.
c61820	Should you not
c61821	know justice?
c61822	You hate good
c61823	and love evil.
c61824	You tear the skin from My people
c61825	and strip the flesh from their bones.
c61826	You eat the flesh of my people
c61827	after stripping off their skin
c61828	and breaking their bones.
c61829	You chop them up
c61830	like [meat] for the cooking pot,
c61831	like meat in a kettle.”
c61832	Then they will cry out to the LORD,
c61833	but He will not answer them.
c61834	At that time He will hide His face from them
c61835	because of the evil they have done.
c61836	This is what the LORD says: “As for the prophets
c61837	who lead My people astray,
c61838	while they chew with their teeth,
c61839	who proclaim peace
c61840	against one who puts nothing ... their mouths:
c61841	but declare war ... in
c61842	Therefore
c61843	the night will come over you without visions,
c61844	and the darkness
c61845	without divination.
c61846	The sun will set on these prophets,
c61847	and the daylight will turn black over them.
c61848	Then the seers will be ashamed
c61849	and the diviners disgraced.
c61850	They will all cover their mouths
c61851	because [there is] no answer from God.
c61852	As for me, however, I am filled with power by the Spirit of the LORD, with justice and courage,
c61853	to declare to Jacob his transgression
c61854	and to Israel his sin.
c61855	Now hear this,
c61856	O leaders of the house of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel,
c61857	who despise justice
c61858	and pervert all that is right,
c61859	who build Zion with bloodshed
c61860	and Jerusalem with iniquity.
c61861	Her leaders judge for a bribe,
c61862	her priests teach for a price,
c61863	and her prophets practice divination for money.
c61864	Yet they lean upon the LORD,
c61865	saying,
c61866	“Is not the LORD among us?
c61867	No disaster can come upon us.”
c61868	Therefore,
c61869	because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field,
c61870	Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,
c61871	and the temple mount a wooded ridge.
c61872	In the last days ... will be
c61873	the mountain of the house of the LORD ... established as the chief of the mountains;
c61874	it will be raised above the hills,
c61875	and the peoples will stream to it.
c61876	And many nations will come
c61877	and say,
c61878	“Come,
c61879	let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob.
c61880	He will teach us His ways,
c61881	so that we may walk in His paths.”
c61882	For the law will go forth from Zion
c61883	and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
c61884	Then He will judge between many peoples
c61885	and arbitrate for strong nations far and wide.
c61886	Then they will beat their swords into plowshares
c61887	and their spears into pruning hooks.
c61888	Nation will no longer take up the sword against nation,
c61889	nor will they train anymore for war.
c61890	will sit
c61891	And each man ... under his own vine [and] under his own fig tree,
c61892	with no one to frighten him.
c61893	For the mouth of the LORD of Hosts has spoken.
c61894	Though ... of the peoples may walk
c61895	each ... in the name of his god,
c61896	yet we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.
c61897	“On that day,”
c61898	declares the LORD,
c61899	“I will gather the lame;
c61900	I will assemble the outcast,
c61902	even those whom I have afflicted.
c61903	And I will make the lame into a remnant,
c61904	and the outcast into a strong nation.
c61905	Then the LORD will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever.
c61906	And you,
c61907	O watchtower of the flock,
c61908	O Stronghold of the daughter of Zion—
c61909	will be restored to you;
c61910	the former dominion ... will come
c61911	sovereignty ... to the Daughter of Jerusalem.
c61912	do you now
c61913	Why ... cry aloud?
c61914	Is there no king among you?
c61915	Has your counselor perished
c61916	so that anguish grips you like a woman in labor?
c61917	Writhe
c61918	in agony,
c61919	O Daughter of Zion,
c61920	like a woman in labor.
c61921	For now you will leave the city
c61922	and camp in the open fields.
c61923	You will go to Babylon;
c61924	there you will be rescued;
c61925	there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies!
c61926	But now many nations have assembled against you,
c61927	saying,
c61928	“Let her be defiled,
c61929	and let us feast our eyes on Zion.”
c61930	But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD
c61931	or understand His plan:
c61932	that He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
c61933	Rise
c61934	and thresh,
c61935	O Daughter of Zion,
c61936	for I will give you horns of iron
c61937	and hooves of bronze
c61938	to break to pieces many peoples.
c61939	Then you will devote their gain to the LORD,
c61940	their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
c61941	Now, ... marshal your troops;
c61942	O daughter of troops,
c61943	for a siege is laid against us!
c61944	With a rod they will strike on the cheek the judge of Israel.
c61945	But you,
c61946	Bethlehem Ephrathah,
c61947	small
c61948	who are ... among the clans of Judah,
c61949	out of you will come forth for Me
c61950	One to be ruler over Israel,
c61951	whose origins are of old, from the days of eternity.
c61952	Therefore
c61953	[Israel] will be abandoned until
c61954	she who is in labor has given birth;
c61955	then the rest of His brothers will return to the children of Israel.
c61956	He will stand
c61957	and shepherd [His flock] in the strength of the LORD, in the majestic name of the LORD His God.
c61958	And they will dwell securely,
c61959	for then His greatness will extend to the ends of the earth.
c61960	And He will be their peace.
c61961	Assyria
c61962	When ... invades our land
c61963	and tramples our citadels,
c61964	we will raise against it seven shepherds, even eight leaders of men.
c61965	And they will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,
c61966	and the land of Nimrod with the blade drawn.
c61967	So He will deliver us ... Assyria
c61968	when ... invades our land,
c61969	and tramples our citadels.
c61970	Then the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples
c61971	like dew from the LORD,
c61972	like showers on the grass,
c61973	which do not wait for man
c61974	or linger for mankind.
c61975	Then the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples,
c61976	like a lion among the beasts of the forest,
c61977	like a young lion among flocks of sheep,
c61978	which
c61979	as it passes through,
c61980	tramples
c61981	and tears
c61982	with no one to rescue them.
c61983	Your hand will be lifted over your foes,
c61984	and all your enemies will be cut off.
c61985	“In that day,”
c61986	declares the LORD,
c61987	“I will remove your horses from among you
c61988	and wreck your chariots.
c61989	I will remove the cities of your land
c61990	and tear down all your strongholds.
c61991	I will cut the sorceries from your hand,
c61992	and you will have no fortune-tellers.
c61993	I will also cut off the carved images and sacred pillars from among you,
c61994	so that you will no longer bow down to the work of your own hands.
c61995	I will root out the Asherah poles from your midst
c61996	and demolish your cities.
c61997	I will take vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations
c61998	that have not obeyed Me.”
c61999	Hear now
c62000	what the LORD says:
c62001	“Arise,
c62002	plead your case before the mountains,
c62003	and let the hills hear your voice.
c62004	Hear,
c62005	O mountains,
c62006	the LORD's indictment,
c62007	you enduring foundations of the earth.
c62008	For the LORD has a case against His people,
c62009	and He will argue it against Israel.
c62010	My people,
c62011	what have I done to you?
c62012	how I have wearied you!
c62013	Testify against Me
c62014	For I brought you up from the land of Egypt
c62015	and redeemed you from the house of bondage.
c62016	I sent Moses before you, as well as Aaron and Miriam.
c62017	My people,
c62018	remember
c62019	what Balak king of Moab counseled
c62020	and what Balaam son of Beor answered.
c62021	Remember [your journey] from Acacia Grove to Gilgal,
c62022	so that you may acknowledge the righteousness of the LORD.”
c62023	With what shall I come before the LORD
c62024	when I bow before the God on high?
c62025	Should I come to Him with burnt offerings, with year-old calves?
c62026	Would the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of oil?
c62027	Shall I present my firstborn for my transgression,
c62028	the fruit of my body [for] the sin of my soul?
c62029	He has shown you,
c62030	O mankind,
c62031	what [is] good.
c62032	And what does the LORD require of you
c62033	but to act justly,
c62034	to love mercy,
c62035	and to walk humbly with your God?
c62036	The voice of the LORD calls out to the city—
c62037	and it is sound wisdom to fear Your name—
c62038	“Heed the rod
c62039	and the One who ordained it.
c62040	Can I forget any longer,
c62041	O house of the wicked, the treasures of wickedness and the short ephah,
c62042	which is accursed?
c62043	Can I excuse dishonest scales or bags of false weights?
c62044	For the wealthy of the city are full of violence,
c62045	and its residents speak lies;
c62046	their tongues are deceitful in their mouths.
c62047	Therefore I ... severely,
c62048	will strike you
c62049	to ruin you because of your sins.
c62050	You will eat
c62051	but not be satisfied,
c62052	and your hunger will remain with you.
c62053	What you acquire,
c62054	you will not preserve;
c62056	and what you save,
c62057	I will give over to the sword.
c62058	You will sow
c62059	but not reap;
c62060	you will press olives
c62061	but not anoint yourselves with oil;
c62062	you will tread grapes
c62063	but not drink the wine.
c62064	You have observed the statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab’s house;
c62065	you have followed their traditions.
c62066	Therefore I will make you a desolation,
c62067	and your inhabitants an object of contempt;
c62068	you will bear the scorn of the nations.”
c62069	Woe is me!
c62070	For I am like one gathering summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard;
c62071	there [is no] cluster
c62072	to eat,
c62073	no early fig
c62074	that I crave.
c62075	The godly [man] has perished from the earth;
c62076	there is no one upright among men.
c62077	They all lie in wait for blood;
c62078	each other
c62079	they hunt ... with a net.
c62080	Both hands ... at evil;
c62081	are skilled
c62082	the prince ... demand
c62083	and the judge ... a bribe;
c62084	when the powerful
c62085	utters his evil desire,
c62086	they all conspire together.
c62087	The best of them [is] like a brier;
c62088	the most upright [is sharper] then a hedge of thorns.
c62089	The day you post your watchmen, your punishment will come;
c62090	then their confusion will arise.
c62091	Do not rely on a friend;
c62092	do not trust in a companion.
c62093	Seal the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your arms.
c62094	For a son dishonors his father,
c62095	a daughter rises against her mother,
c62096	and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
c62097	a man’s enemies [are] the members of his own household.
c62098	But as for me, I will look to the LORD;
c62099	I will wait for the God of my salvation.
c62100	My God will hear me.
c62101	Do not gloat
c62102	my enemy!
c62103	over me,
c62104	Though I have fallen,
c62105	I will arise;
c62106	though I sit in darkness,
c62107	the LORD will be my light.
c62108	I must endure the rage of the LORD,
c62109	Because I have sinned against Him,
c62110	until He argues my case
c62111	and executes justice for me.
c62112	He will bring me into the light;
c62113	I will see His righteousness.
c62114	Then my enemy will see
c62115	and will be covered with shame—
c62116	she who said to me,
c62117	“Where is the LORD your God?”
c62118	My eyes will see her;
c62119	at that time she will be trampled
c62120	like mud in the streets.
c62121	The day
c62122	for rebuilding your walls will come—
c62123	the day for extending your boundary.
c62124	On that day
c62125	they will come to you
c62126	from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
c62127	even from Egypt to the Euphrates
c62128	and from sea to sea
c62129	and mountain to mountain.
c62130	Then the earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the result of their deeds.
c62131	Shepherd with Your staff Your people, the flock of Your inheritance.
c62132	They live alone in a woodland, surrounded by pastures.
c62133	Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
c62134	As in the days when
c62135	you came out of Egypt,
c62136	I will show My wonders.
c62137	Nations will see
c62138	and be ashamed, deprived of all their might.
c62139	They will put their hands over their mouths,
c62140	and their ears will become deaf.
c62141	They will lick the dust like a snake, like reptiles slithering on the ground.
c62142	They will crawl from their holes
c62143	in the presence of the LORD our God; they will tremble
c62144	in fear of you.
c62145	Who is a God like You,
c62146	who pardons iniquity
c62147	and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance—
c62148	who does not retain His anger forever,
c62149	because He delights in loving devotion?
c62150	He will again
c62151	have compassion on us;
c62152	He will vanquish our iniquities.
c62153	You will cast out all our sins into the depths of the sea.
c62154	You will show loyalty to Jacob
c62155	and loving devotion to Abraham,
c62156	as You swore to our fathers from days of old.
c62157	This is the oracle of Nineveh,
c62158	the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:
c62159	The LORD is a jealous and avenging God;
c62160	the LORD is avenging
c62161	and full of wrath.
c62162	The LORD takes vengeance on His foes
c62163	and reserves [wrath] for His enemies.
c62164	The LORD is slow to anger and great in power;
c62165	will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.
c62166	the LORD
c62167	His path is in the whirlwind and storm,
c62168	and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.
c62169	He rebukes the sea
c62170	and dries it up;
c62171	He makes all the rivers run dry.
c62172	Bashan and Carmel wither,
c62173	and the flower of Lebanon wilts.
c62174	The mountains quake before Him,
c62175	and the hills melt away;
c62176	the earth trembles at His presence—
c62177	the world and all
c62178	its dwellers
c62179	can withstand His indignation?
c62180	Who
c62181	Who can endure His burning anger?
c62182	His wrath is poured out like fire;
c62183	even rocks are shattered before Him.
c62184	The LORD is good,
c62185	a stronghold in the day of distress;
c62186	He cares for
c62187	those who trust in Him.
c62188	But with an overflowing flood, He will make an end [of Nineveh]
c62189	and pursue His enemies into darkness.
c62190	Whatever you plot against the LORD,
c62191	He will bring to an end.
c62192	Affliction will not rise up a second time.
c62193	For
c62194	they will be entangled as with thorns
c62195	like the drink of a drunkard—
c62196	and consumed ... like stubble that is fully dry.
c62197	From you, [O Nineveh], comes forth
c62198	a plotter of evil against the LORD,
c62199	a counselor of wickedness.
c62200	This is what the LORD says:
c62201	“Though they are allied
c62202	and numerous,
c62203	yet they will be cut down
c62204	and pass away.
c62205	Though I have afflicted you, [O Judah],
c62206	I will afflict you no longer.
c62207	I will now
c62208	For from you ... break off his yoke
c62209	and tear away your shackles.”
c62210	The LORD has issued a command concerning you, [O Nineveh]:
c62211	“There will be no descendants to carry on your name.
c62212	I will cut off the carved image and cast idol from the house of your gods;
c62213	I will prepare your grave,
c62214	for you are contemptible.”
c62215	Look to the mountains— the feet of one who brings good news,
c62216	who proclaims peace!
c62217	Celebrate
c62218	O Judah;
c62219	your feasts,
c62220	fulfill your vows.
c62221	For ... will never again
c62222	march through you;
c62223	the wicked
c62224	they will be utterly cut off.
c62225	One who scatters advances against you, [O Nineveh].
c62226	Guard the fortress!
c62227	Watch the road!
c62228	Brace yourself!
c62229	Summon all your strength!
c62230	For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel,
c62231	though destroyers have laid them waste
c62232	and ruined the branches of their vine.
c62233	The shields of his mighty men are red;
c62234	the valiant warriors are dressed in scarlet.
c62235	The fittings of the chariots flash like fire on the day
c62236	they are prepared,
c62237	and the spears of cypress have been brandished.
c62238	The chariots dash through the streets;
c62239	they rush around the plazas,
c62240	appearing like torches,
c62241	darting about like lightning.
c62242	He summons his nobles;
c62243	they stumble as they advance.
c62244	They race to its wall;
c62245	the protective shield is set in place.
c62246	The river gates are thrown open,
c62247	and the palace erodes away.
c62248	It is decreed that
c62249	[the city] be exiled
c62250	and carried away;
c62251	her maidservants moan like doves,
c62252	and beat upon their breasts.
c62253	Nineveh has been like a pool of water throughout her days,
c62254	but now it is draining away.
c62255	“Stop!
c62256	Stop!” they cry,
c62257	but no one turns back.
c62258	“Plunder the silver!
c62259	Plunder the gold!”
c62260	There is no end to the treasure,
c62261	an abundance of every precious thing.
c62262	She is emptied! Yes , she is desolate and laid waste!
c62263	Hearts melt,
c62264	knees knock,
c62265	bodies tremble, and every
c62266	face grows pale!
c62267	Where is the lions’ lair
c62268	or the feeding ground
c62269	of the young lions,
c62270	where the lion and lioness prowled
c62271	with [their] cubs,
c62272	with nothing to frighten them away?
c62273	The lion
c62274	mauled enough for its cubs
c62275	and strangled prey for the lioness.
c62276	It filled its dens with the kill,
c62277	and its lairs with mauled prey.
c62278	“Behold, I am against you,”
c62279	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c62280	“I will send your chariots up in smoke
c62281	and the sword will devour your young lions.
c62282	I will cut off your prey from the earth,
c62283	and the voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”
c62284	Woe
c62285	to the city of blood,
c62286	full of lies,
c62287	full of plunder,
c62288	never without prey.
c62289	The crack of the whip,
c62290	the rumble of the wheel,
c62291	galloping horse
c62292	and bounding chariot!
c62293	Charging horseman,
c62294	flashing sword, shining spear; heaps of slain, mounds of corpses,
c62295	dead bodies without end—
c62296	they stumble over their dead—
c62297	because of the many harlotries of the harlot, the seductive mistress of sorcery,
c62298	who betrays nations by her prostitution
c62299	and clans by her witchcraft.
c62300	“Behold, I [am] against you,”
c62301	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c62302	“I will lift your skirts over your face.
c62303	I will show your nakedness to the nations
c62304	and your shame to the kingdoms.
c62305	I will pelt you with filth
c62306	and treat you with contempt;
c62307	I will make a spectacle of you.
c62308	Then
c62309	all who see you will recoil from you
c62310	and say,
c62311	‘Nineveh is devastated;
c62312	who will grieve for her?’
c62313	Where can I find comforters for you?”
c62314	Are you better than Thebes,
c62315	situated by the Nile
c62316	with water around her,
c62317	whose rampart was the sea,
c62318	whose wall was the water?
c62319	Cush ... strength;
c62320	and Egypt
c62321	were her boundless
c62322	Put and Libya were her allies.
c62323	Yet she became an exile; she went into captivity.
c62324	Her infants were dashed to pieces at the head of every street.
c62325	They cast lots for her dignitaries,
c62326	and all her nobles were bound in chains.
c62327	You too will become drunk;
c62328	You will go into hiding
c62329	and seek refuge from the enemy.
c62330	All your fortresses are fig trees with the first ripe figs;
c62331	when shaken,
c62332	they fall into the mouth of the eater!
c62333	Behold, your troops are like your women;
c62334	the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies;
c62335	fire consumes their bars.
c62336	Draw your water for the siege;
c62337	strengthen your fortresses.
c62338	Work the clay
c62339	and tread the mortar;
c62340	repair the brick [kiln]!
c62341	There the fire will devour you;
c62342	the sword will cut you down
c62343	and consume you like a young locust.
c62344	Make yourself many like the young locust;
c62345	make yourself many like the swarming locust!
c62346	You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars of the sky.
c62347	The young locust strips the land
c62348	and flies away.
c62349	Your guardsmen are like the swarming locust,
c62350	and your scribes like clouds of locusts,
c62351	that settle on the walls on a cold day.
c62352	When the sun rises,
c62353	they fly away,
c62354	and no one knows
c62355	where.
c62356	your shepherds slumber;
c62357	O king of Assyria,
c62358	your officers sleep.
c62359	Your people are scattered on the mountains
c62360	with no one to gather them.
c62361	There is no healing for your injury;
c62362	your wound is severe.
c62363	All who hear the news of you will applaud your [downfall],
c62364	for who has not experienced your endless cruelty?
c62365	[This is] the oracle
c62366	that Habakkuk the prophet received in a vision:
c62367	How long,
c62368	O LORD,
c62369	must I call for help
c62370	but You do not hear,
c62371	or cry out to You, “Violence!”
c62372	but You do not save?
c62373	Why do You make me see iniquity?
c62374	Why do You tolerate wrongdoing?
c62375	Destruction and violence [are] before me.
c62376	Strife is ongoing,
c62377	and conflict abounds.
c62378	Therefore the law is paralyzed,
c62379	and justice never goes forth.
c62380	For the wicked hem in the righteous;
c62381	therefore, justice is perverted.
c62382	Look at the nations
c62383	and observe—
c62384	be utterly astounded!
c62386	For [I am] doing a work in your days
c62387	that you would never believe
c62388	even if you were told.
c62389	For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans— that ruthless and impetuous nation
c62390	that marches through the breadth of the earth
c62391	to seize dwelling places
c62392	not their own.
c62393	They are dreaded and feared;
c62394	their justice and sovereignty proceed from themselves.
c62395	Their horses are swifter than leopards,
c62396	fiercer than wolves of the night.
c62397	Their horsemen charge ahead,
c62398	and their cavalry comes from afar.
c62399	They fly like a vulture,
c62400	swooping down
c62401	to devour.
c62402	All of them come ... on violence;
c62403	bent ... their hordes [advance like] the east [wind];
c62404	they gather prisoners like sand.
c62405	They
c62406	scoff at kings
c62407	and {make} rulers an object of scorn.
c62408	They
c62409	laugh at every fortress
c62410	and build up siege ramps
c62411	to seize it.
c62412	Then they sweep by like the wind
c62413	and pass on through.
c62414	are guilty;
c62415	They ... their own strength is their god.
c62416	Are You not from everlasting,
c62417	O LORD, my God, my Holy One?
c62418	We will not die.
c62419	O LORD,
c62420	You have appointed them to execute judgment;
c62421	O Rock,
c62422	for correction.
c62423	You have established them
c62424	Your eyes are too pure
c62425	to look on evil,
c62427	tolerate wrongdoing.
c62428	and You cannot
c62429	So why do You tolerate the faithless?
c62430	Why are You silent
c62431	while the wicked swallow up
c62432	those more righteous than themselves?
c62433	You have made men like the fish of the sea,
c62434	like sea creatures
c62435	with no ruler.
c62436	[The Chaldeans] bring all of them up with a hook;
c62437	they catch them in their net,
c62438	and gather them in their dragnet;
c62439	so they are glad
c62440	and rejoice.
c62441	Therefore they sacrifice to their dragnet
c62442	and burn incense to their fishing net,
c62443	for by these things their portion is sumptuous
c62444	and their food is rich.
c62445	Will they, therefore, empty their net
c62446	and continue
c62447	to slay nations
c62448	without mercy?
c62449	I will stand at my guard post
c62450	and station myself on the ramparts.
c62451	I will watch
c62452	to see
c62453	what He will say to me
c62454	and how I will answer my reproof.
c62455	Then the LORD answered me:
c62457	“Write down this vision
c62458	and clearly inscribe it on tablets,
c62459	so that ... may run
c62460	a herald ... with it.
c62461	For the vision awaits an appointed time;
c62462	it testifies of the end,
c62463	and will not lie.
c62464	Though it lingers,
c62465	wait for it,
c62466	since it will surely come
c62467	and not delay.
c62468	Look at the proud one;
c62469	his soul is not upright—
c62470	but the righteous will live by his faith—
c62471	furthermore,
c62472	wine betrays; an arrogant man
c62473	is never at rest.
c62474	He enlarges his appetite like Sheol,
c62475	and like Death, he
c62476	is never satisfied.
c62477	He gathers all nations to himself
c62478	and collects all the peoples as his own.
c62479	Will not all of these take up a taunt against him,
c62480	with mockery and riddles against him,
c62481	saying:
c62482	‘Woe
c62483	to him who amasses
c62484	what is not his
c62485	How long will this go on?’
c62486	and makes himself rich with many loans!
c62487	Will not your creditors suddenly arise
c62488	and those who disturb you awaken?
c62489	Then you will become their prey.
c62490	Because you have plundered many nations,
c62491	the remnant of the people will plunder you for your bloodshed against man and your violence against the land and city and all
c62492	their dwellers
c62493	Woe
c62494	to him who builds his house by unjust gain,
c62495	to place his nest on high
c62496	[and] escape the hand of disaster!
c62497	You have plotted shame for your house
c62498	by cutting off many peoples
c62499	and sinning [against] your soul.
c62500	For the stones will cry out from the wall,
c62501	and the rafters will echo it from the woodwork.
c62502	Woe
c62503	to him who builds a city with bloodshed
c62504	and establishes a town by iniquity!
c62505	Is it not
c62506	indeed from the LORD of Hosts
c62507	that the labor of the people only feeds the fire,
c62508	and nations weary themselves in vain?
c62509	For the earth will be filled
c62510	with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD
c62511	as the waters cover the sea.
c62512	Woe
c62513	to him who gives drink to his neighbors,
c62514	pouring it from the wineskin
c62515	until they are drunk,
c62516	in order to gaze at their nakedness!
c62517	You will be filled with shame instead of glory.
c62518	You too must drink
c62519	and expose your uncircumcision!
c62520	The cup in the LORD’s right hand will come around to you,
c62521	and utter disgrace will cover your glory.
c62522	For your violence against Lebanon will overwhelm you,
c62523	and the destruction of animals will terrify you, because of the blood of men and violence against lands, cities, and everyone
c62524	in them.
c62525	What use is an idol,
c62526	that a craftsman should carve it—
c62527	[or] an image,
c62528	a teacher of lies?
c62529	For its maker trusts in his own creation;
c62530	he makes idols that cannot speak.
c62531	Woe
c62532	to him who says to wood,
c62533	‘Awaken!’
c62534	‘Come alive!’
c62535	or to silent stone,
c62536	Can it give guidance?
c62537	Behold, it [is] overlaid with gold and silver,
c62538	yet there is no breath in it at all.
c62539	But the LORD is in His holy temple;
c62540	be silent before Him.”
c62541	let all the earth
c62542	[This is] a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet,
c62543	according to Shigionoth:
c62544	O LORD,
c62545	I have heard the report of You;
c62546	I stand in awe,
c62547	O LORD,
c62548	of Your deeds.
c62549	Revive them in these years;
c62550	make them known in these years.
c62551	In Your wrath, ... mercy!
c62552	remember
c62553	God came from Teman,
c62554	and the Holy One from Mount Paran.
c62555	Selah
c62556	His glory covered the heavens,
c62557	and His praise filled the earth.
c62558	[His] radiance was like the sunlight;
c62559	rays [flashed] from His hand,
c62560	where His power is hidden.
c62561	Plague went before Him,
c62562	and pestilence followed in His steps.
c62563	He stood
c62564	and measured the earth;
c62565	He looked
c62566	and startled the nations;
c62567	the ancient mountains were scattered;
c62568	the perpetual hills bowed.
c62569	His ways [are] everlasting.
c62570	I saw the tents of Cushan in distress;
c62571	the curtains of Midian were trembling.
c62572	Were You angry at the rivers,
c62573	O LORD?
c62574	Was Your wrath against the streams?
c62575	Did You rage against the sea
c62576	when You rode on Your horses,
c62577	on Your chariots of salvation?
c62578	You brandished Your bow;
c62579	You called for many arrows.
c62580	Selah
c62581	You split the earth with rivers.
c62582	saw You
c62583	The mountains ... [and] quaked;
c62584	torrents of water swept by.
c62585	The deep roared with its voice
c62586	and lifted its hands on high.
c62587	Sun and moon stood still in their places
c62588	at the flash of Your flying arrows,
c62589	at the brightness of Your shining spear.
c62590	You marched across the earth with fury;
c62591	You threshed the nations in wrath.
c62592	You went forth for the salvation of Your people,
c62593	to save Your anointed.
c62594	You crushed the head of the house of the wicked
c62595	and stripped him from head to foot.
c62596	Selah
c62597	With his own spear You pierced his head, when his warriors
c62598	stormed out
c62599	to scatter us,
c62600	gloating
c62601	as though ready to secretly devour the weak.
c62602	You trampled the sea with Your horses,
c62603	churning the great waters.
c62604	I heard
c62605	and trembled within;
c62606	my lips quivered at the sound.
c62607	Decay entered my bones;
c62608	I trembled where I stood.
c62609	Yet I must wait patiently for the day of distress
c62610	to come upon the people
c62611	who invade us.
c62612	Though the fig tree does not bud
c62613	and no fruit [is] on the vines,
c62614	though the olive crop fails
c62615	and the fields produce no food,
c62616	though the sheep are cut off from the fold
c62617	and no cattle [are] in the stalls,
c62618	yet I will exult in the LORD;
c62619	I will rejoice in the God of my salvation!
c62620	GOD the Lord is my strength;
c62621	He makes my feet like those of a deer;
c62622	He makes me walk upon the heights!
c62623	For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments.
c62624	[This is] the word of the LORD
c62625	that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah:
c62626	“I will utterly sweep away everything from the face of the earth,”
c62627	declares the LORD.
c62628	“I will sweep away man and beast;
c62629	I will sweep away the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, and the ruins
c62630	along with the wicked.
c62631	I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth,”
c62632	declares the LORD.
c62633	“I will stretch out My hand against Judah and against all who dwell in Jerusalem.
c62634	I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal,
c62635	the names of the idolatrous and [pagan] priests—
c62636	those who bow on the rooftops to worship the heavenly host,
c62637	those who bow down
c62638	and swear by the LORD
c62639	but also swear by Molech,
c62640	and those who turn back from [following] the LORD
c62641	and neither seek the LORD
c62642	nor inquire of Him.”
c62643	Be silent in the presence of the Lord GOD,
c62644	for the Day of the LORD is near.
c62645	Indeed, the LORD has prepared a sacrifice;
c62646	He has consecrated His guests.
c62647	On the Day of the LORD’s sacrifice
c62648	I will punish the princes, the king’s sons, and all
c62649	who are dressed in foreign apparel.
c62650	I will punish all ... over
c62651	On that day ... who leap ... the threshold,
c62652	who fill the house of their master with violence and deceit.
c62653	“On that day,” ... will go up
c62654	declares the LORD,
c62655	“a cry ... from the Fish Gate,
c62656	a wail from the Second Quarter,
c62657	and a loud crashing from the hills.
c62658	Wail,
c62659	O dwellers of the Hollow,
c62660	for all your merchants will be silenced;
c62661	all who weigh out silver will be cut off.
c62662	And at that time
c62663	I will search Jerusalem with lamps
c62664	and punish the men
c62665	settled in complacency,
c62666	who say to themselves,
c62667	‘The LORD will do nothing, either good
c62668	or ill.’
c62669	Their wealth will be plundered
c62670	and their houses laid waste.
c62671	They will build houses
c62672	but not inhabit [them],
c62673	and plant vineyards
c62674	but never drink their wine.
c62675	The great Day of the LORD is near—
c62676	near
c62677	and coming quickly.
c62678	Listen, the Day of the LORD! ... will be bitter.
c62679	Then the cry of the mighty
c62680	That day will be a day of wrath,
c62681	a day of trouble and distress,
c62682	a day of destruction and desolation,
c62683	a day of darkness and gloom,
c62684	a day of clouds and blackness,
c62685	a day of trumpet blast and battle cry against the fortified cities, and against the high corner towers.
c62686	I will bring such distress on mankind
c62687	that they will walk like the blind,
c62688	because they have sinned against the LORD.
c62689	Their blood will be poured out like dust
c62690	and their flesh like dung.
c62691	[Neither] their silver nor their gold will be able
c62692	to deliver them on the Day of the LORD’s wrath.
c62693	The whole earth will be consumed by the fire of His jealousy.”
c62694	For indeed, He will make a sudden end of all the inhabitants of the earth.
c62695	Gather yourselves,
c62696	gather together,
c62697	nation,
c62698	O shameful
c62699	before the decree takes effect
c62700	and the day passes like chaff,
c62701	before the burning anger of the LORD comes upon you,
c62702	before the Day of the LORD’s anger comes upon you.
c62703	Seek the LORD,
c62704	all you humble of the earth,
c62705	who carry out His justice.
c62706	Seek righteousness;
c62707	seek humility.
c62708	Perhaps you will be sheltered on the Day of the LORD’s anger.
c62709	For Gaza will be abandoned,
c62710	and Ashkelon left in ruins.
c62711	Ashdod will be driven out at noon,
c62712	and Ekron will be uprooted.
c62713	Woe
c62714	to the inhabitants of the seacoast,
c62715	O nation of the Cherethites!
c62716	The word of the LORD is against you,
c62717	O Canaan,
c62718	land of the Philistines:
c62719	‘I will destroy you, and no one will be left.’
c62720	So the seacoast will become [a land of] pastures, having caves filled with shepherds and folds with sheep.
c62721	The coast will belong to the remnant of the house of Judah;
c62722	there they will find pasture.
c62723	They will lie down in the evening among the houses of Ashkelon,
c62724	for the LORD their God will attend to them
c62725	and restore their captives.
c62726	I have heard the reproach of Moab
c62727	and the insults of the Ammonites,
c62728	who have taunted My people
c62729	and threatened their borders.
c62730	Therefore,
c62731	as surely as I live,
c62732	declares the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel,
c62733	surely Moab will be like Sodom
c62734	and the Ammonites like Gomorrah—
c62735	a place of weeds and saltpits, and a perpetual wasteland.
c62736	The remnant of My people will plunder them;
c62737	the remainder of My nation will dispossess them.
c62738	This they shall have in return for their pride,
c62739	for taunting
c62740	and mocking the people of the LORD of Hosts.
c62741	The LORD will be terrifying to them
c62742	when He starves all the gods of the earth.
c62743	will bow in worship to Him,
c62744	each in their own place.
c62745	Then the nations of every shore
c62746	You too, ... will
c62747	O Cushites,
c62748	be slain by My sword.
c62749	And He will stretch out His hand against the north
c62750	and destroy Assyria;
c62751	He will make Nineveh a desolation,
c62752	as dry as a desert.
c62753	Herds will lie down in her midst, creatures of every kind.
c62754	Both the desert owl and screech owl will roost atop her [pillars].
c62755	Their calls will sound from the window,
c62756	but desolation will lie on the threshold,
c62757	for He will expose the beams of cedar.
c62758	This carefree city
c62759	that dwells securely,
c62760	that thinks to herself:
c62761	‘I [am it],
c62762	and [there is] none besides me,’
c62763	what a ruin she has become,
c62764	a resting place for beasts.
c62765	Everyone
c62766	who passes by her
c62767	hisses
c62768	and shakes his fist.
c62769	Woe
c62770	rebellious
c62771	and defiled!
c62772	to the city of oppressors,
c62773	She heeded no voice;
c62774	she accepted no instruction.
c62775	She does not trust in the LORD;
c62776	she has not drawn near to her God.
c62777	Her princes are roaring lions;
c62778	her judges [are] evening wolves,
c62779	leaving nothing for the morning.
c62780	Her prophets are reckless,
c62781	faithless men.
c62782	Her priests profane the sanctuary;
c62783	they do violence to the law.
c62784	The LORD within her is righteous;
c62785	He does no wrong.
c62786	He applies His justice morning by morning;
c62787	He does not fail at dawn,
c62788	yet the unjust knows no shame.
c62789	“I have cut off the nations;
c62790	their corner towers are destroyed.
c62791	I have made their streets {deserted} with no one to pass through.
c62792	Their cities are laid waste, with no man, no inhabitant.
c62793	I said,
c62794	‘Surely you will fear Me
c62795	and accept correction.’
c62796	Then her dwelling place would not be cut off [despite] all
c62797	for which I punished her.
c62798	But they rose early
c62799	to corrupt all their deeds.
c62800	Therefore
c62801	wait for Me,”
c62802	declares the LORD,
c62803	“until the day
c62804	I rise to testify.
c62805	For My decision
c62806	is to gather nations,
c62807	to assemble kingdoms,
c62808	to pour out upon them My indignation, all My burning anger.
c62809	For all the earth will be consumed by the fire of My jealousy.
c62810	For then I will restore pure lips to the peoples,
c62811	that all may call upon the name of the LORD
c62812	and serve Him shoulder to shoulder.
c62813	From beyond the rivers of Cush My worshipers, My scattered people, will bring Me an offering.
c62814	On that day you will not be put to shame for any of the deeds
c62815	by which you transgress against Me.
c62816	For then I will remove from among you those who rejoice in their pride,
c62817	and you will never again
c62818	be haughty on My holy mountain.
c62819	But I will leave within you a meek and humble people,
c62820	and they will trust in the name of the LORD.
c62821	The remnant of Israel will no longer do wrong
c62822	[or] speak lies,
c62823	nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths.
c62824	But they will feed
c62825	and lie down,
c62826	with no one to make them tremble.”
c62827	Sing for joy,
c62828	O daughter of Zion;
c62829	shout aloud,
c62830	O Israel!
c62831	Be glad
c62832	and rejoice with all your heart,
c62833	O daughter of Jerusalem!
c62834	The LORD has taken away your punishment;
c62835	He has turned back your enemy.
c62836	Israel's King, the LORD, is among you;
c62837	no longer will you fear any harm.
c62838	On that day they will say to Jerusalem:
c62839	“Do not fear,
c62840	O Zion;
c62841	do not let your hands fall limp.
c62842	The LORD your God is among you;
c62843	He is mighty
c62844	to save.
c62845	He will rejoice over you with gladness;
c62846	He will quiet [you] with His love;
c62847	He will rejoice over you with singing.”
c62848	those among you who grieve over the appointed feasts,
c62849	“I will gather
c62850	so that
c62851	you will no longer suffer reproach.
c62852	Behold, at that time, I will deal with all who afflict you.
c62853	I will save the lame
c62854	and gather the scattered;
c62855	and I will appoint praise and fame
c62856	for the disgraced throughout the earth.
c62857	At that time I will bring you in;
c62858	yes, at the time
c62859	I will gather you.
c62860	For I will give you fame and praise among all the peoples of the earth
c62861	when I restore your fortunes before your eyes,”
c62862	says the LORD.
c62863	In the second year of the reign of Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest,
c62864	stating
c62865	that this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c62866	say,
c62867	“These people
c62868	‘The time has not yet come ... the house of the LORD.’”
c62869	to rebuild
c62870	Then the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet,
c62871	saying:
c62872	“Is it a time for you yourselves
c62873	to live in your paneled houses,
c62874	while this house lies in ruins?”
c62875	Now
c62876	this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c62877	“Think carefully about your ways.
c62878	You have planted much
c62879	but harvested little.
c62880	You eat
c62881	but never have enough.
c62882	You drink
c62883	but never
c62884	have your fill.
c62885	You put on clothes
c62886	but never
c62887	get warm.
c62888	You earn wages to put into a bag pierced through.”
c62889	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c62890	“Think carefully about your ways.
c62891	Go up into the hills,
c62892	bring down lumber,
c62893	and build the house,
c62894	so that I may take pleasure in it
c62895	and be glorified,
c62896	says the LORD.
c62897	You expected
c62898	much,
c62899	but behold, it amounted to little.
c62900	And what you brought home,
c62901	I blew away.
c62902	Why?
c62903	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c62904	Because My house
c62905	still lies in ruins,
c62906	of you is busy
c62907	while each ... with his own house.
c62908	Therefore, on account of you the heavens have withheld their dew
c62909	and the earth has withheld its crops.
c62910	I have summoned a drought on the fields [and] on the mountains, on the grain, new wine, and olive oil, ... on ... and on
c62912	and on whatever the ground yields,
c62913	man and beast, ... all the labor of [your] hands.”
c62914	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, as well as all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of the prophet Haggai,
c62915	because the LORD their God had sent him.
c62916	So the people feared the LORD.
c62917	Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, delivered the LORD’s message to the people,
c62918	saying:
c62919	“I [am] with you,”
c62920	declares the LORD.
c62921	So the LORD stirred the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, as well as the spirit of all the remnant of the people.
c62922	And they came
c62923	and began the work on the house of the LORD of Hosts, their God,
c62924	on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius.
c62925	On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet,
c62926	saying:
c62927	“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and also to the remnant of the people.
c62928	Ask them,
c62929	‘Who is left among you
c62930	who saw this house in its former glory?
c62931	How does it look to you now?
c62932	Does it not appear to you like nothing in comparison?’
c62933	But now take courage,
c62934	O Zerubbabel,
c62935	declares the LORD.
c62936	Be strong,
c62937	O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
c62938	And be strong,
c62939	all you people of the land,
c62940	declares the LORD.
c62941	Work!
c62942	For I am with you,
c62943	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c62944	This is the promise
c62945	I made to you
c62946	when you came out of Egypt.
c62947	And My Spirit remains among you;
c62948	do not be afraid.”
c62949	For this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c62950	“Once more, in a little while,
c62951	I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.
c62952	I will shake all the nations,
c62953	and they will come with all [their] treasures,
c62954	and I will fill this house with glory,
c62955	says the LORD of Hosts.
c62956	The silver [is] Mine,
c62957	and the gold [is] Mine,
c62958	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c62959	The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,
c62960	says the LORD of Hosts.
c62961	And in this place I will provide peace,
c62962	declares the LORD of Hosts.”
c62963	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet,
c62964	saying,
c62965	“This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c62966	‘Ask the priests for a ruling.
c62968	If a man carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment,
c62969	and it touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food,
c62970	does [that item] become holy?’”
c62971	replied the priests.
c62973	“No,”
c62974	So Haggai asked,
c62975	“If [one who is] defiled by contact with a corpse touches any of these,
c62976	does it become defiled?”
c62977	the priests answered.
c62979	“Yes, it becomes defiled,”
c62980	Then Haggai replied:
c62982	“So is this people,
c62983	and so is this nation before Me,
c62984	declares the LORD,
c62985	and so is every work of their hands;
c62986	and whatever they offer there
c62987	is defiled.
c62988	Now consider carefully from this day forward:
c62989	Before one stone was placed on another in the temple of the LORD,
c62990	from that time
c62991	[when] one came expecting a heap of twenty [ephahs of grain],
c62992	there were [but] ten.
c62993	When one came to the winepress
c62994	to draw out fifty [baths],
c62995	there were [but] twenty.
c62996	I struck you— ... with blight, mildew, and hail,
c62997	all the work of your hands—
c62998	but you did not turn to Me,
c62999	declares the LORD.
c63000	Consider carefully from this day forward— from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth [month], the day
c63001	the foundation of the LORD’s temple was laid—
c63002	consider carefully:
c63003	Is there still seed in the barn?
c63004	The vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yet yielded [fruit].
c63005	But from this day on, I will bless you.”
c63006	For the second time that day, the twenty-fourth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to Haggai,
c63007	saying:
c63008	“Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah
c63009	[that]
c63010	I am about to shake the heavens and the earth:
c63011	I will overturn royal thrones
c63012	and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations.
c63013	I will overturn chariots and their riders;
c63014	horses and their riders will fall,
c63015	each by the sword of his brother.
c63016	On that day,
c63017	declares the LORD of Hosts,
c63018	I will take you,
c63019	My servant, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,
c63020	declares the LORD,
c63021	and I will make you like My signet ring,
c63022	for I have chosen you,
c63023	declares the LORD of Hosts.”
c63024	In the eighth month of the second year of [the reign] of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo,
c63025	saying:
c63026	“The LORD was very angry with your forefathers.
c63027	So tell [the people] ... to Me,’
c63028	that this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63029	‘Return ... to you,’
c63030	declares the LORD of Hosts,
c63031	‘and I will return
c63032	says the LORD of Hosts.
c63033	Do not be like your forefathers,
c63034	to whom the former prophets proclaimed:
c63035	says:
c63036	This is what the LORD of Hosts
c63037	‘Turn now from your evil ways and your evil deeds.’
c63038	But they did not listen
c63039	or pay attention to Me,
c63040	declares the LORD.
c63041	are your forefathers now?
c63042	Where
c63043	And the prophets,
c63044	do they live forever?
c63045	But ... My words and My statutes,
c63046	which I commanded My servants the prophets,
c63047	did not ... overtake your forefathers?
c63048	They repented
c63049	and said,
c63050	‘Just as the LORD of Hosts purposed
c63051	to do to us according to our ways and deeds,
c63052	so He has done to us.’”
c63053	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month,
c63054	the month of Shebat,
c63055	in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo.
c63057	I looked out into the night
c63058	and saw
c63059	a man
c63060	riding on a red horse
c63061	that stood among the myrtle trees
c63062	in the hollow.
c63063	Behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
c63064	I asked.
c63065	“What are these,
c63066	my lord?”
c63067	And the angel ... replied,
c63068	who was speaking with me
c63069	“I will show
c63070	you what they are.”
c63071	Then the man ... explained,
c63072	standing among the myrtle trees
c63074	“They
c63075	are the ones the LORD has sent
c63076	to patrol the earth.”
c63077	And [the riders] answered the Angel of the LORD
c63078	who stood among the myrtle trees,
c63080	“We have patrolled the earth,
c63081	and behold,
c63082	all the earth is at rest
c63083	and tranquil.”
c63084	Then the Angel of the LORD
c63085	said,
c63086	O LORD of Hosts,
c63087	“How long, ... will You withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah,
c63088	with which You have been angry these seventy years?”
c63089	So the LORD spoke ... to the angel
c63090	who was speaking with me.
c63091	kind and comforting words
c63092	Then the angel ... with me said,
c63093	who was speaking
c63094	“Proclaim
c63095	this word:
c63096	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63097	‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,
c63098	but I am fiercely angry with the nations that are at ease.
c63099	For I was a little angry,
c63100	but they have increased the calamity.’
c63101	Therefore,
c63102	this is what the LORD says:
c63103	‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy,
c63104	and there My house will be rebuilt,
c63105	declares the LORD of Hosts,
c63106	and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.’
c63107	Proclaim further:
c63108	says:
c63109	This is what the LORD of Hosts
c63110	‘My cities will again overflow with prosperity;
c63111	the LORD will again comfort Zion
c63112	[and] choose Jerusalem.’”
c63113	Then I looked up
c63114	and saw
c63116	four horns.
c63117	So I asked the angel
c63118	who was speaking with me,
c63119	“What are these?”
c63120	And he told me,
c63121	“These are the horns
c63122	that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
c63123	Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
c63124	I asked.
c63125	“What are these coming
c63126	to do?”
c63127	And He replied,
c63129	“These are the horns
c63130	that scattered Judah
c63131	so that no one could raise his head;
c63132	but the [craftsmen] have come
c63133	to terrify them
c63134	[and] throw down these horns of the nations
c63135	that lifted up their horns against the land of Judah
c63136	to scatter it.”
c63137	Then I lifted up my eyes
c63138	and saw
c63140	a man
c63141	with a measuring line in his hand.
c63142	I asked.
c63143	“Where are you going?”
c63144	he replied,
c63145	“To measure Jerusalem,”
c63146	“and to determine
c63147	its width
c63148	and length.”
c63149	Then
c63150	the angel
c63151	who was speaking
c63152	with me went out,
c63153	and another angel came out
c63154	to meet him
c63155	and said to him,
c63156	“Run
c63157	and tell that young man:
c63159	‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the multitude of men and livestock within it.
c63160	For I will be
c63161	declares the LORD,
c63162	a wall of fire around it,
c63163	and I will be the glory within it.’”
c63164	“Get up! Get up!
c63165	Flee from the land of the north,”
c63166	declares the LORD,
c63167	“for I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven,”
c63168	declares the LORD.
c63169	“Get up,
c63170	O Zion!
c63171	Escape,
c63172	you who dwell with the Daughter of Babylon.”
c63173	For this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63174	“After His glory has sent me against the nations
c63175	that have plundered you—
c63176	for
c63177	whoever touches you
c63178	touches the apple of His eye—
c63179	I will surely wave My hand over them,
c63180	so that they will become plunder for their own servants.
c63181	Then you will know
c63182	that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me.”
c63183	“Shout for joy
c63184	and be glad,
c63185	O daughter of Zion,
c63186	for I am coming
c63187	to dwell among you,”
c63188	declares the LORD.
c63189	“On that day many nations will join themselves to the LORD,
c63190	and they will become My people.
c63191	I will dwell among you,
c63192	and you will know
c63193	that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you.
c63194	And the LORD will take possession of Judah as His portion in the Holy Land,
c63195	and He will once again choose Jerusalem.
c63196	Be silent
c63197	all people,
c63198	before the LORD,
c63199	for He has roused Himself from His holy dwelling.”
c63200	Then [the angel] showed me Joshua the high priest
c63201	standing before the Angel of the LORD,
c63202	with Satan standing at his right hand
c63203	to accuse him.
c63204	And the LORD said to Satan:
c63205	“The LORD rebukes you,
c63206	Satan!
c63207	Indeed, the LORD, ... rebukes you!
c63208	who has chosen Jerusalem,
c63209	Is not this man a firebrand
c63210	snatched from the fire?”
c63211	Now Joshua was dressed in filthy garments
c63212	as he stood before the Angel.
c63213	So [the Angel of the LORD]
c63214	said
c63215	to those standing before Him,
c63217	“Take off his filthy clothes!”
c63218	Then He said to [Joshua],
c63219	“See,
c63220	I have removed your iniquity,
c63221	and I will clothe you with splendid robes.”
c63222	Then I said,
c63223	“Let them put a clean turban on his head.”
c63224	So a clean turban was placed on his head,
c63225	and they clothed him,
c63226	as the Angel of the LORD stood by.
c63227	Then the Angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua:
c63229	“This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63230	‘If you walk in My ways
c63231	and keep My instructions,
c63232	then you will both govern My house
c63233	and have charge of My courts;
c63234	and I will give you a place among these standing here.’
c63235	‘Hear now,
c63236	O high priest Joshua,
c63237	you and your companions
c63238	seated before you,
c63239	who are indeed a sign.
c63240	For behold, I am going to bring My servant, the Branch.
c63241	See the stone
c63242	I have set before Joshua;
c63243	on that one stone are seven eyes.
c63244	Behold, I will engrave on it an inscription,’
c63245	declares the LORD of Hosts,
c63246	‘and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.
c63247	On that day,’
c63248	declares the LORD of Hosts,
c63249	of you will invite
c63250	‘each ... his neighbor
c63251	to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.’”
c63252	Then the angel ... returned
c63253	who was speaking with me
c63254	and woke me, as a man
c63255	is awakened from his sleep.
c63256	he asked.
c63257	“What do you see?”
c63258	I replied,
c63259	“I see
c63260	a solid gold lampstand,” ... “with
c63261	a bowl at the top
c63262	and seven lamps on it,
c63263	with seven spouts to each of the lamps.
c63265	There are also two olive trees beside it,
c63266	one on the right of the bowl
c63267	and the other on its left.”
c63268	I asked
c63269	the angel
c63270	who was speaking with me.
c63272	“What are these,
c63273	my lord?”
c63274	replied the angel.
c63276	I answered.
c63277	“Do you not know
c63278	what they are?”
c63280	“No,
c63281	my lord,”
c63282	So he said to me,
c63283	to ... says
c63285	“This is the word of the LORD ... Zerubbabel:
c63287	Not by might
c63288	nor by power,
c63289	but by My Spirit,
c63290	the LORD of Hosts.
c63291	What are you,
c63292	O great mountain?
c63293	Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain.
c63294	Then he will bring forth the capstone accompanied by shouts of
c63295	‘Grace, grace to it!’”
c63296	Then the word of the LORD came to me:
c63298	“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house,
c63299	and his hands will complete it.
c63300	Then you will know
c63301	that the LORD of Hosts has sent me to you.
c63302	For who has despised the day of small things?
c63303	will rejoice
c63304	when they see the plumb line in Zerubbabel’s hand.”
c63305	But these seven
c63306	eyes of the LORD, which
c63307	scan the whole earth,
c63308	Then I asked
c63309	[the angel],
c63310	“What are the two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand?”
c63311	And I questioned him further,
c63313	“What are the two olive branches
c63314	beside the two gold pipes
c63315	from which the golden [oil] pours?”
c63316	he inquired.
c63318	“Do you not know
c63319	what these are?”
c63320	I replied.
c63321	“No,
c63322	my lord,”
c63323	So he said,
c63324	“These are the two anointed ones
c63325	who are standing beside the Lord of all the earth.”
c63326	Again
c63327	I lifted up my eyes
c63328	and saw
c63329	before me a flying scroll.
c63330	asked [the angel].
c63331	“What do you see?”
c63332	I replied,
c63333	“I see a flying scroll,”
c63334	“twenty cubits long
c63335	and ten cubits wide.”
c63336	Then he told me,
c63337	“This is the curse
c63338	that is going out over the face of all the land,
c63339	for ... every
c63340	thief
c63341	according [to] one [side] of [the scroll], ... will be removed;
c63342	everyone
c63343	who swears falsely
c63344	and according to the other side, ... will be removed.
c63345	I will send it out,
c63346	declares the LORD of Hosts,
c63347	and it will enter the house of the thief and the house
c63348	of him who swears falsely by My name.
c63349	It will remain inside his house
c63350	and destroy it,
c63351	[down to] its timbers and its stones.”
c63352	Then the angel ... with me came forward
c63353	who was speaking
c63354	and told me,
c63355	“Now lift up your eyes
c63356	and see
c63357	what is approaching.”
c63358	I asked.
c63359	“What is it?”
c63360	And he replied,
c63361	“It is a measuring basket
c63362	that is approaching.”
c63363	Then he continued,
c63364	“This is their iniquity in all the land.”
c63365	And behold,
c63366	the cover of lead was raised,
c63367	and there was a woman
c63368	sitting inside the basket.
c63369	he said.
c63370	“This is Wickedness,”
c63371	And he shoved her down into the basket,
c63372	pushing down the lead cover over its opening.
c63373	Then I lifted up my eyes
c63374	and saw
c63375	two women approaching,
c63376	with the wind in their wings.
c63377	Their wings were like those of a stork,
c63378	and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth.
c63379	I asked the angel
c63380	who was speaking with me.
c63381	“Where are they taking the basket?”
c63382	he told me.
c63383	“To build a house for it in the land of Shinar,”
c63384	“And when it is ready,
c63385	the basket will be set there on its pedestal.”
c63386	And again
c63387	I lifted up my eyes
c63388	and saw
c63390	four chariots coming out from between two mountains—
c63391	mountains of bronze.
c63392	The first chariot had red horses,
c63393	the second black horses,
c63394	the third white horses,
c63395	and the fourth dappled horses— all of them strong.
c63397	So I inquired of the angel
c63398	who was speaking with me,
c63399	“What are these,
c63400	my lord?”
c63401	And the angel
c63402	told me,
c63403	“These are the four spirits of heaven, going out
c63404	from [their] station before the Lord of all the earth.
c63405	The one with the black horses
c63406	is going toward the land of the north,
c63407	[the one with] the white [horses] toward [the west],
c63408	and [the one with] the dappled [horses] toward the south.”
c63409	As the strong [horses] went out,
c63410	they were eager
c63411	to go
c63412	[and] patrol the earth;
c63413	and the LORD said,
c63414	“Go,
c63415	patrol the earth.”
c63416	So they patrolled the earth.
c63417	Then [the LORD] summoned me
c63418	to
c63419	and said,
c63420	“Behold,
c63421	those going ... the land of the north
c63422	have given rest to My Spirit in the land of the north.”
c63423	The word of the LORD also came to me,
c63424	saying,
c63425	“Take an offering from the exiles— from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah,
c63426	have arrived ... that same day
c63427	and go ... to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
c63428	who ... from Babylon—
c63429	Take silver and gold,
c63430	make an [ornate] crown,
c63431	and set [it] on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak.
c63432	And you are to tell him
c63433	says:
c63434	that this is what the LORD of Hosts
c63436	‘Behold, a man
c63437	whose name [is] the Branch,
c63438	and He will branch out from His place
c63439	and build the temple of the LORD.
c63440	Yes, He will build the temple of the LORD;
c63441	He will be clothed in splendor
c63442	and will sit
c63443	on His throne and rule.
c63444	There will also be a priest on His throne,
c63445	and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them.
c63446	The crown will reside in the temple of the LORD as a memorial to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen son of Zephaniah.
c63447	Even those far away will come
c63448	and build the temple of the LORD,
c63449	and you will know
c63450	that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you.
c63451	This will happen
c63452	if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.”
c63453	In the fourth year of King Darius, ... came
c63454	the word of the LORD ... to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Chislev.
c63455	Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, along with their men,
c63456	to plead before the LORD
c63457	by asking the priests
c63458	of the house of the LORD of Hosts
c63459	as well as the prophets,
c63461	“Should I weep ... in the fifth month,
c63462	and fast
c63463	as I have done these many years?”
c63464	Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me,
c63465	saying,
c63466	“Ask all the people of the land and the priests,
c63468	‘When you fasted
c63469	and mourned
c63470	in the fifth and seventh months
c63471	for these seventy years,
c63472	{was it really} for Me that you fasted?
c63473	And when you were eating
c63474	and drinking,
c63475	were you not [doing so]
c63478	simply for yourselves?
c63479	Are these not the words
c63480	that the LORD proclaimed through the earlier prophets,
c63481	when Jerusalem ... were populous and prosperous,
c63482	and its surrounding towns ... and the Negev and the Lowland were inhabited?’”
c63483	Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah,
c63484	saying,
c63485	“This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63487	‘Administer true justice.
c63488	Show loving devotion and compassion
c63489	to one another.
c63490	Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor.
c63491	And do not plot evil in your hearts against one another.’
c63492	But they refused
c63493	to pay attention
c63494	and turned a stubborn shoulder;
c63495	they stopped up their ears
c63496	from hearing.
c63497	They made their hearts [like] flint
c63498	and would not listen to the law and the words
c63499	that the LORD of Hosts had sent by His Spirit through the earlier prophets.
c63500	Therefore great anger came from the LORD of Hosts.
c63501	Therefore
c63502	just as I had called
c63503	and they would not listen,
c63504	so when they called
c63505	I would not listen,
c63506	says the LORD of Hosts.
c63507	But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations
c63508	that they had not known,
c63509	and the land ... behind them, so that no one could come or go. ... into a desolation.”
c63510	was left desolate ... Thus they turned a pleasant land
c63511	Again the word of the LORD of Hosts came [to me],
c63512	saying:
c63513	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63514	“I am jealous for Zion with great zeal;
c63515	I am jealous for her with great fervor.”
c63516	This is what the LORD says:
c63517	“I will return to Zion
c63518	and dwell in Jerusalem.
c63519	Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth,
c63520	and the mountain of the LORD of Hosts [will be called] the Holy Mountain.”
c63521	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63522	“Old men and old women will again sit along the streets of Jerusalem,
c63523	each
c63524	with a staff in hand because of great age.
c63525	And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls
c63526	playing there.”
c63527	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63528	“If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days,
c63529	should it also be marvelous in My eyes?”
c63530	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c63531	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63532	“I will save My people from the land of the east and the land of the west.
c63533	I will bring
c63534	them back to live in Jerusalem,
c63535	where they will be My people,
c63536	and I will be their faithful and righteous God.”
c63537	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63538	“Let your hands be strong,
c63539	you who now hear these words ... by the prophets
c63540	spoken ... [who were present] when
c63541	the foundations were laid ... the temple, the house of the LORD of Hosts.
c63542	to rebuild
c63543	For before those days neither man ... received wages,
c63544	beast
c63545	nor
c63546	nor was there safety from the enemy for anyone who came or went,
c63547	for I had turned every man
c63548	against his neighbor.
c63549	But now
c63550	I will not treat the remnant of this people as I did in the past,”
c63551	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c63552	“For the seed [will be] prosperous,
c63553	the vine will yield its fruit,
c63554	the ground will yield its produce,
c63555	and the skies will give their dew.
c63556	To the remnant of this people {I will give} all these things as an inheritance.
c63558	As you have been a curse among the nations,
c63559	O house of Judah and house of Israel,
c63560	so I will save you,
c63561	and you will be a blessing.
c63562	Do not be afraid;
c63563	let your hands be strong.”
c63564	For this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63565	“Just as I resolved
c63566	to bring disaster upon you
c63567	when your fathers provoked Me to anger,
c63568	says the LORD of Hosts,
c63569	and I did not relent,”
c63570	“so ... again
c63571	now I have resolved
c63572	to do good ... to Jerusalem and Judah.
c63573	Do not be afraid.
c63574	These are the things
c63575	you must do:
c63576	Speak truth
c63577	to one another,
c63578	render true and sound decisions in your gates,
c63580	evil ... against your neighbor,
c63581	do not plot ... in your hearts
c63582	and do not love perjury,
c63583	for ... all these things,”
c63584	I hate
c63585	declares the LORD.
c63586	Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me,
c63587	saying,
c63588	“This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63589	The fasts of the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, and the tenth [months] will become times of joy and gladness, cheerful feasts for the house of Judah.
c63590	Therefore love truth and peace.”
c63591	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63592	will yet
c63593	“Peoples ... come— the residents of many cities—
c63594	and the residents of one city will go to another,
c63595	saying:
c63596	‘Let us go
c63597	at once to plead before the LORD
c63598	and to seek the LORD of Hosts.
c63599	I myself am going.’
c63600	And many peoples and strong nations will come
c63601	to seek the LORD of Hosts in Jerusalem
c63602	and to plead before the LORD.”
c63603	This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c63604	“In those days
c63605	ten men from all nations [and] languages will tightly
c63606	grasp the robe of a Jewish man,
c63607	saying,
c63608	‘Let us go with you,
c63609	for we have heard
c63610	that God is with you.’”
c63611	An Oracle:
c63612	The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach
c63613	and will rest upon Damascus—
c63614	for the eyes of men ... are upon the LORD—
c63615	and of all the tribes of Israel
c63616	and also upon Hamath,
c63617	which borders it,
c63618	as well as Tyre and Sidon,
c63619	though they are very shrewd.
c63620	Tyre has built herself a fortress;
c63621	she has heaped up silver like dust,
c63622	and gold like the dirt of the streets.
c63623	Behold, the Lord will impoverish her
c63624	and cast her power into the sea,
c63625	and she will be consumed by fire.
c63626	Ashkelon will see
c63627	and fear;
c63628	Gaza
c63629	will writhe in agony,
c63630	as will Ekron,
c63631	for her hope will wither.
c63632	There will cease to be a king in Gaza,
c63633	and Ashkelon will be uninhabited.
c63634	A mixed race will occupy Ashdod,
c63635	and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
c63636	I will remove the blood from their mouths
c63637	and the abominations from between their teeth.
c63638	Then they too will become a remnant for our God;
c63639	they will become like a clan in Judah,
c63640	and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
c63641	But I will camp around My house because of an army, because of those who march to and fro,
c63642	and never again will an oppressor overrun [My people],
c63643	for now I keep watch with My own eyes.
c63644	Rejoice greatly,
c63645	O daughter of Zion!
c63646	Shout in triumph,
c63647	O daughter of Jerusalem!
c63648	See, your King comes to you,
c63649	righteous and victorious,
c63650	gentle
c63651	and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
c63652	And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
c63653	and the horse from Jerusalem,
c63654	and the bow of war will be broken.
c63655	Then He will proclaim peace to the nations;
c63656	His dominion will extend from sea to sea,
c63657	and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.
c63658	As for you,
c63659	because of the blood of [My] covenant, I will release your prisoners ... pit.
c63660	from the waterless
c63661	Return to your stronghold,
c63662	O prisoners of hope;
c63663	even today I declare
c63664	that I will restore to you double.
c63665	For I will bend Judah
c63666	as My bow and fit it with Ephraim.
c63667	I will rouse your sons,
c63668	O Zion,
c63669	against the sons
c63670	of Greece.
c63671	I will make you like the sword of a mighty man.
c63672	Then the LORD will appear over them,
c63673	and His arrow will go forth like lightning.
c63674	The Lord GOD will sound the trumpet
c63675	and advance in the whirlwinds of the south.
c63676	The LORD of Hosts will shield them.
c63677	They will consume
c63678	and conquer with slingstones;
c63679	they will drink
c63680	[and] roar as with wine.
c63681	And they will be filled like [sacrificial] basins, [drenched] like the corners of the altar.
c63682	On that day the LORD their God will save them as the flock of His people;
c63683	for like jewels in a crown,
c63684	they will sparkle over His land.
c63685	How lovely they will be,
c63686	and how beautiful!
c63687	Grain will make the young men
c63688	flourish, and new wine, the young women.
c63689	Ask the LORD for rain in springtime;
c63690	the LORD makes the storm clouds,
c63691	and He will give them showers of rain
c63692	and crops of the field for everyone.
c63693	For idols speak deceit
c63694	and diviners see illusions;
c63695	they tell false dreams
c63696	and offer empty comfort.
c63697	Therefore the people wander like sheep,
c63698	oppressed
c63699	for lack of a shepherd.
c63700	“My anger burns against the shepherds,
c63701	and I will punish the leaders.
c63702	For the LORD of Hosts attends to His flock, the house of Judah;
c63703	He will make them like His royal steed in battle.
c63704	The cornerstone
c63705	will come from Judah, the tent peg
c63706	from him, as well as the battle bow
c63707	and every ruler together.
c63708	They will be like mighty men
c63709	in battle, trampling [the enemy] in the mire of the streets.
c63710	They will fight
c63711	because the LORD is with them,
c63712	and they will put the horsemen to shame.
c63713	I will strengthen the house of Judah
c63714	and deliver the house of Joseph.
c63715	I will restore them
c63716	because I have compassion on them,
c63717	and they will be
c63718	as though I had not rejected them.
c63719	For I am the LORD their God,
c63720	and I will answer them.
c63721	Ephraim will be like a mighty man,
c63722	and their hearts will be glad as with wine.
c63723	Their children will see it
c63724	and be glad;
c63725	their hearts will rejoice in the LORD.
c63726	I will whistle for them
c63727	to gather,
c63728	for I have redeemed them;
c63729	and they will be as numerous
c63730	as they once were.
c63731	Though I sow them among the nations,
c63732	they will remember Me in distant lands;
c63733	they and their children will live
c63734	and return.
c63735	I will bring them back from Egypt
c63736	and gather them from Assyria.
c63737	I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon
c63738	until no [more room] is found for them.
c63739	They will pass through the sea of distress
c63740	and strike the waves of the sea;
c63741	all the depths of the Nile will dry up.
c63742	The pride of Assyria will be brought down,
c63743	and the scepter of Egypt will depart.
c63744	I will strengthen them in the LORD,
c63745	and in His name they will walk,”
c63746	declares the LORD.
c63747	Open
c63748	O Lebanon,
c63749	your doors,
c63750	that the fire may consume your cedars.
c63751	Wail,
c63752	O cypress,
c63753	for the cedar has fallen;
c63754	the majestic [trees] are ruined!
c63755	Wail,
c63756	O oaks of Bashan,
c63757	for the dense forest has been cut down!
c63758	Listen to the wail of the shepherds,
c63759	for their glory is in ruins.
c63760	Listen to the howl of the young lions,
c63761	for the thickets of the Jordan are destroyed.
c63762	This is what the LORD my God says:
c63763	“Pasture the flock [marked] for slaughter,
c63764	whose buyers slaughter them
c63765	without remorse.
c63766	Those who sell them say,
c63767	‘Praise the LORD,
c63768	for I am rich!’
c63769	Even their own shepherds have no compassion for them.
c63770	For I will no longer have compassion on the people of the land,”
c63771	declares the LORD,
c63772	“but behold,
c63773	I ... man to fall
c63774	will cause each ... into the hand of his neighbor and of his king,
c63775	who will devastate the land,
c63776	and I will not deliver it from their hands.”
c63777	So I pastured the flock marked for slaughter,
c63778	especially the afflicted of the flock.
c63779	Then I took for myself two staffs,
c63780	calling one
c63781	Favor
c63782	and the other
c63783	Union,
c63784	and I pastured the flock.
c63785	And in one month I dismissed three shepherds.
c63786	My soul grew impatient with [the flock],
c63787	and their souls also detested me.
c63788	Then I said,
c63789	“I will no longer shepherd you.
c63790	Let the dying
c63791	die,
c63793	and the perishing
c63794	perish;
c63796	let the rest
c63797	devour
c63798	one another's flesh.”
c63799	Next I took my staff called Favor
c63800	and cut it in two,
c63801	revoking the covenant
c63802	I had made with all the nations.
c63803	It was revoked on that day,
c63804	and so the afflicted of the flock ... me knew
c63805	who were watching
c63806	that it was the word of the LORD.
c63807	Then I told them,
c63808	“If it seems right to you,
c63809	give me my wages;
c63810	but if not,
c63811	keep them.”
c63812	So they weighed out my wages, thirty [pieces] of silver.
c63813	And the LORD said ... it to
c63814	to me, “Throw ... the potter,”
c63815	this magnificent price
c63816	at which they valued me.
c63817	So I took the thirty pieces of silver
c63818	and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
c63819	Then I cut in pieces my second staff [called] Union,
c63820	breaking the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
c63821	And the LORD said to me:
c63822	“Take up once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
c63823	For behold,
c63824	I will raise up a shepherd in the land
c63825	who will neither care for the lost,
c63826	nor seek the young,
c63827	nor heal the broken, nor
c63828	sustain the healthy,
c63829	but he will devour the flesh of the choice [sheep]
c63830	and tear off their hooves.
c63831	“Woe to the worthless shepherd,
c63832	who deserts the flock!
c63833	May a sword strike his arm and his right eye!
c63834	May his arm be completely withered
c63835	and his right eye utterly blinded!”
c63836	An oracle
c63837	of the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
c63838	[Thus] declares the LORD,
c63839	who stretches out the heavens
c63840	and lays the foundation of the earth,
c63841	who forms the spirit of man within him:
c63842	“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples.
c63843	Judah will be besieged, as well as Jerusalem.
c63845	On that day, ... I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples;
c63846	all who would heave it away will be severely injured.
c63847	when all the nations of the earth gather against her,
c63848	On that day,”
c63849	declares the LORD,
c63850	“I will strike every horse with panic,
c63851	and [every] rider with madness.
c63852	I will keep a watchful eye on the house of Judah,
c63853	but I will strike all the horses of the nations with blindness.
c63854	Then the leaders of Judah will say in their hearts:
c63855	‘The people of Jerusalem are my strength, for the LORD of Hosts [is] their God.’
c63856	On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile,
c63857	like a flaming torch among the sheaves;
c63858	they will consume all the peoples around them on the right and on the left,
c63859	while the residents of Jerusalem remain secure in Jerusalem.
c63860	The LORD will save the tents of Judah first,
c63861	so that the glory of the house of David [and] of the residents of Jerusalem may not be greater than that of Judah.
c63862	On that day the LORD will defend the residents of Jerusalem,
c63863	will be
c63864	the weakest among them
c63865	so that ... like David,
c63866	and the house of David will be like God, like the Angel of the LORD going before them.
c63867	So
c63868	on that day I will set out
c63869	to destroy all the nations
c63870	that come against Jerusalem.
c63871	Then I will pour out on the house of David and on the residents of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and prayer,
c63872	and they will look on Me,
c63873	the One they have pierced.
c63874	They will mourn for Him as one mourns an only child, ... for Him
c63875	and weep bitterly
c63876	as one grieves a firstborn son.
c63877	On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
c63878	The land will mourn,
c63879	each clan on its own:
c63880	the clan of the house of David
c63881	and their wives,
c63882	the clan of the house of Nathan
c63883	and their wives,
c63884	the clan of the house of Levi
c63885	and their wives,
c63886	the clan of Shimei
c63887	and their wives,
c63888	and all ... clans
c63889	the remaining
c63891	and their wives.
c63892	On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the residents of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
c63893	And on that day,
c63894	declares the LORD of Hosts,
c63895	I will erase the names of the idols from the land,
c63896	and they will no longer be remembered.
c63897	I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.
c63898	And
c63899	if anyone still prophesies,
c63900	his father and mother ... will say to him,
c63901	who bore him
c63902	‘You shall not remain alive,
c63903	because you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD.’
c63904	his father and mother ... will pierce him through.
c63905	who bore him
c63906	When he prophesies,
c63907	And
c63908	on that day ... prophet ... will be ashamed
c63909	every ... of his vision,
c63910	who prophesies
c63911	and he will not put on a hairy cloak
c63912	in order to deceive.
c63913	He will say,
c63914	‘I am not a prophet;
c63916	work the land,
c63917	I
c63918	for I was purchased as a servant in my youth.
c63919	If someone asks him,
c63920	‘What are these wounds on your chest?’
c63921	he will answer,
c63922	‘These are the wounds I received in the house of my friends.’
c63923	O sword,
c63924	Awake, ... against My shepherd, against the man who is My Companion,”
c63925	declares the LORD of Hosts.
c63926	“Strike the shepherd,
c63927	and the sheep will be scattered,
c63928	and I will turn My hand against the little ones.
c63929	And in all the land,”
c63930	declares the LORD,
c63931	“two-thirds will be cut off
c63932	[and] perish,
c63933	but a third will be left in it.
c63934	This third I will bring through the fire;
c63935	I will refine them
c63936	like silver
c63937	and test them
c63938	like gold.
c63939	They will call on My name, ... ‘They
c63940	and I will answer them.
c63941	I will say,
c63942	are My people,’ and they
c63943	will say,
c63944	‘The LORD [is] our God.’”
c63945	Behold, a day of the LORD is coming
c63946	when your plunder will be divided in your presence.
c63947	For I will gather all the nations for battle against Jerusalem,
c63948	and the city will be captured,
c63949	the houses looted,
c63950	and the women ravished.
c63951	Half of the city will go into captivity,
c63952	but the rest of the people will not be removed from the city.
c63953	Then the LORD will go out
c63954	to fight against those nations,
c63955	as He fights in the day of battle.
c63956	On that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives,
c63957	east of Jerusalem,
c63958	and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west,
c63959	forming a great valley,
c63960	with half the mountain moving to the north
c63961	and half to the south.
c63962	You will flee by My mountain valley,
c63963	for [it] will extend to Azal.
c63964	You will flee
c63965	as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.
c63966	Then the LORD my God will come,
c63967	and all the holy ones with Him.
c63968	there will be
c63969	On that day ... no light, no cold or frost.
c63970	It will be
c63971	a day ... only
c63972	known ... to the LORD,
c63973	without day
c63974	or night;
c63975	there will be
c63976	but when evening comes, ... light.
c63977	And
c63978	on that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem,
c63979	half of it toward the eastern sea
c63980	and the other half toward the western sea,
c63981	in summer and winter alike.
c63982	the LORD will become King over all the earth—
c63983	On that day ... the LORD alone,
c63984	and His name alone.
c63985	All the land from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem will be turned into a plain,
c63986	but Jerusalem will be raised up
c63987	and will remain in her place,
c63988	from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate,
c63989	and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.
c63990	People will live there,
c63991	and never again will there be an [utter] destruction.
c63992	So Jerusalem will dwell securely.
c63993	And this will be the plague
c63994	with which the LORD strikes all the peoples who
c63995	have warred against Jerusalem:
c63996	Their flesh will rot
c63997	while they stand on their feet,
c63998	their eyes will rot in their sockets,
c63999	and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
c64000	will come upon them,
c64001	On that day a great panic from the LORD
c64002	so that each will seize the hand of another,
c64003	and the hand of one will rise against the other.
c64004	Judah will also fight at Jerusalem,
c64005	and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—
c64006	gold, silver, and apparel in great abundance.
c64007	And a similar plague will strike the horses and mules, camels and donkeys, and all the animals
c64008	in those camps.
c64011	Then all
c64012	the survivors from the nations
c64013	that came against Jerusalem
c64014	will go up year after year
c64015	to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts,
c64016	and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
c64017	fall
c64018	And should any of the families of the earth not go up to Jerusalem
c64019	to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts,
c64020	the rain will not ... on them.
c64021	And if the people of Egypt will not go up
c64022	and enter in, then rain will not
c64023	fall on them; this will be the plague ... do not
c64024	the LORD inflicts on the nations who
c64025	go up
c64026	to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
c64027	This will be the punishment of Egypt and of all the nations
c64028	that do not go up
c64029	to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
c64030	On that day, ... will be [inscribed] on the bells of the horses,
c64031	HOLY TO THE LORD
c64032	and the cooking pots in the house of the LORD will be like the sprinkling basins before the altar.
c64033	Indeed, every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the LORD of Hosts,
c64034	and all who sacrifice will come
c64035	and take some [pots]
c64036	and cook in them.
c64037	And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of Hosts.
c64038	[This is] an oracle,
c64039	the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi:
c64040	“I have loved you,”
c64041	says the LORD.
c64042	But you ask,
c64043	“How have You loved us?”
c64044	“Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?”
c64045	declares the LORD.
c64046	“Yet Jacob I have loved,
c64047	but Esau I have hated,
c64048	and I have made his mountains a wasteland
c64049	and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.”
c64050	Though Edom may say,
c64051	“We have been devastated,
c64052	but we will rebuild
c64053	the ruins,”
c64054	this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c64055	“They may build,
c64056	but I will demolish.
c64057	They will be called the Land of Wickedness,
c64058	and a people
c64059	toward whom the LORD is indignant forever.
c64060	You will see this with your own eyes,
c64061	and you yourselves will say,
c64062	‘The LORD is great— even beyond the borders of Israel.’”
c64063	“A son honors his father,
c64064	and a servant his master.
c64066	But if I am a father,
c64067	where is My honor?
c64069	And if I am a master,
c64070	where is your fear of Me?”
c64071	says the LORD of Hosts to you
c64072	priests
c64073	who despise My name.
c64074	Yet you ask,
c64075	“How have we despised Your name?”
c64076	“By presenting defiled food on My altar.”
c64077	You ask,
c64078	“How have we defiled You?”
c64079	“By saying that
c64080	the table of the LORD
c64081	is contemptible.”
c64083	“When you offer blind animals
c64084	for sacrifice,
c64085	is it not wrong?
c64087	And when you present the lame and sick [ones],
c64088	is it not wrong?
c64089	Why not offer them to your governor!
c64090	Would he be pleased
c64091	with you or show you favor?”
c64092	asks the LORD of Hosts.
c64093	“But {ask} now
c64094	for God’s favor.
c64095	Will He be gracious to us?
c64096	Since this has come from your hands,
c64097	will He show you favor?”
c64098	asks the LORD of Hosts.
c64099	“Oh, that one of you
c64100	would shut the temple doors,
c64101	so that you would no longer kindle useless fires on My altar!
c64102	I take no pleasure in you,”
c64103	says the LORD of Hosts,
c64104	“and I will accept no offering from your hands.”
c64105	“For My name will be great among the nations, from the rising to the setting of the sun.
c64106	In every place, incense and pure offerings [will be] presented in My name,
c64107	because My name will be great among the nations,”
c64108	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64109	“But you profane it
c64110	when you say,
c64111	‘The table of the LORD
c64112	is defiled,
c64113	and its fruit,
c64114	its food, is contemptible.’
c64115	You also say:
c64116	‘Look, what a nuisance!’
c64117	And you turn up your nose at it,”
c64118	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64119	“You bring ... [animals that are] stolen, lame, or sick!
c64120	as an offering
c64121	Should I accept this from your hands?”
c64122	asks the LORD.
c64123	“But cursed [is] the deceiver
c64124	who has an acceptable male in his flock
c64125	and vows to give it,
c64126	but sacrifices a defective animal to the Lord.
c64127	For I am a great King,”
c64128	says the LORD of Hosts,
c64129	“and My name [is to be] feared among the nations.”
c64130	And now this decree is for you,
c64131	O priests:
c64132	“If you do not listen,
c64133	and if you do not take [it] to heart
c64134	to honor My name,”
c64135	says the LORD of Hosts,
c64136	“I will send a curse among you,
c64137	and I will curse your blessings.
c64138	Yes, I have already begun to curse them,
c64139	because you are not taking it to heart.
c64140	Behold, I will rebuke your descendants,
c64141	and I will spread dung on your faces, the waste from your feasts,
c64142	and you will be carried off with it.”
c64143	Then you will know
c64144	that I have sent you this commandment,
c64145	that My covenant with Levi may continue,”
c64146	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64147	“My covenant with him was [one] of life and peace,
c64148	and I gave them to him; it called for reverence,
c64149	and he revered Me
c64150	and stood in awe of My name.
c64151	True instruction was in his mouth,
c64152	and nothing false was found on his lips.
c64153	He walked with Me in peace and uprightness,
c64154	and he turned many from iniquity.
c64155	For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge,
c64156	and people should seek instruction from his mouth,
c64157	because he is the messenger of the LORD of Hosts.”
c64158	“But you have departed from the way,
c64159	and your instruction has caused many to stumble.
c64160	You have violated the covenant of Levi,”
c64161	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64162	“So I in turn have made you despised and humiliated before all the people,
c64163	because you have not kept My ways,
c64164	but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”
c64165	Do we not all have one Father?
c64166	Did not one God create us?
c64167	Why then do we break faith
c64168	with one another
c64169	so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?
c64170	Judah has broken faith;
c64171	an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem.
c64172	For Judah has profaned the LORD's ... sanctuary
c64173	beloved
c64174	by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.
c64175	[As] for the man ... may the LORD cut off
c64176	who does this,
c64177	from the tents of Jacob [everyone who is] awake and aware—
c64178	even if he brings an offering to the LORD of Hosts.
c64179	And this is another thing you do:
c64180	You cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping and groaning,
c64181	because He no longer regards your offerings
c64182	or receives them gladly from your hands.
c64183	Yet you ask,
c64184	“Why?”
c64185	It is because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth,
c64186	against whom you have broken faith,
c64187	though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
c64188	Has not [the LORD] made them one,
c64189	having a portion of the Spirit?
c64190	And why one? Because He seeks
c64191	godly offspring.
c64192	Therefore guard yourselves in your spirit
c64193	and do not break faith with the wife of your youth.
c64194	“For I hate
c64195	divorce,”
c64196	says the LORD, the God of Israel,
c64197	“and [I hate when a man] covers himself and his garment with violence,”
c64198	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64199	Therefore guard yourselves in your spirit
c64200	and do not break faith.
c64201	You have wearied the LORD with your words;
c64202	yet you ask,
c64203	“How have we wearied Him?”
c64204	By saying,
c64205	“All who do evil [are] good in the sight of the LORD,
c64206	and in them He delights,”
c64207	or,
c64208	“Where is the God of justice?”
c64209	“Behold, I will send My messenger,
c64210	who will prepare the way before Me.
c64211	Then the Lord ... will suddenly come to His temple—
c64212	whom you seek
c64213	the Messenger of the covenant,
c64214	in whom you delight—
c64215	see, He is coming,”
c64216	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64217	But who can endure the day
c64218	of His coming?
c64219	And who
c64220	can stand
c64221	when He appears?
c64222	For He will be like a refiner’s fire, [like] a launderer's soap.
c64223	And He will sit
c64224	as a refiner
c64225	and purifier of silver;
c64226	He will purify the sons of Levi
c64227	and refine them like gold and silver.
c64228	Then they will present offerings to the LORD in righteousness.
c64229	Then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will please the LORD, as in days of old and years gone by.
c64230	“Then I will draw near to you for judgment.
c64231	And I will be a swift witness against sorcerers and adulterers and perjurers,
c64232	against oppressors of the widowed and fatherless, and against those who defraud laborers of their wages
c64233	and deny justice to the foreigner
c64234	but do not fear Me,”
c64235	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64236	“Because I, the LORD, do not change,
c64237	you
c64238	descendants of Jacob
c64239	have not been destroyed.
c64240	Yet from the days of your fathers, you have turned away from My statutes
c64241	and have not kept them.
c64242	Return to Me,
c64243	and I will return to you,”
c64244	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64245	But you ask,
c64246	“How can we return?”
c64247	“Will a man rob God?
c64248	Yet you are robbing Me!”
c64249	You ask,
c64250	“How do we rob You?”
c64251	“In tithes and offerings.
c64252	You are cursed with a curse,
c64253	yet you— ... are still robbing Me.
c64254	the whole nation—
c64255	Bring the full tithe into the storehouse,
c64256	so that there may be food in My house.
c64257	Test Me in this,”
c64258	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64259	“See if I will not open the floodgates of heaven
c64260	and pour out for you blessing without measure.
c64261	I will rebuke the devourer for you,
c64262	so that it will not destroy the fruits of your land,
c64263	and the vine in your field will not fail to produce fruit,”
c64264	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64265	“Then all the nations will call you blessed,
c64266	for you will be a land of delight,”
c64267	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64268	“Your words against Me have been harsh,”
c64269	says the LORD.
c64270	“Yet you ask,
c64271	‘What have we spoken against You?’
c64272	You have said,
c64273	‘It is futile
c64274	to serve God.
c64275	What have we gained
c64276	by keeping His requirements
c64277	and walking mournfully before the LORD of Hosts?
c64278	So now
c64279	we call the arrogant blessed.
c64280	Not only do evildoers prosper,
c64281	they even test God
c64282	and escape.’”
c64283	At that time, those who feared the LORD spoke
c64284	to one another,
c64285	and the LORD listened
c64286	and heard [them].
c64287	So a scroll of remembrance was written before Him regarding those who feared the LORD and honored His name.
c64288	“They will be Mine,”
c64289	says the LORD of Hosts,
c64290	“on the day
c64291	when I prepare
c64292	My treasured possession.
c64293	And I will spare them
c64294	as a man spares his own son
c64295	who serves him.
c64296	So you will again
c64297	distinguish between the righteous and the wicked,
c64298	between those who serve God
c64299	and those who do not.”
c64300	“For behold, the day is coming,
c64301	burning like a furnace,
c64302	when all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble;
c64303	the day is coming when I will set them ablaze,”
c64304	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64305	“Not a root or branch will be left to them.”
c64306	“But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise
c64307	with healing in its wings,
c64308	and you will go out
c64309	and leap like calves from the stall.
c64310	Then you will trample the wicked,
c64311	for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day
c64312	I am preparing,”
c64313	says the LORD of Hosts.
c64314	“Remember the Law of Moses My servant,
c64315	I commanded him for all Israel at Horeb.
c64316	the statutes and ordinances
c64317	Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet
c64318	before the coming of the great and dreadful Day of the LORD.
c64319	And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children,
c64320	and the hearts of the children to their fathers.
c64321	Otherwise, I will come
c64322	and strike the land with a curse.”
c64323	Blessed [is] the man
c64324	who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
c64325	or set foot on the path of sinners,
c64326	or sit in the seat of mockers.
c64327	But his delight [is] in the law of the LORD,
c64328	and on His law he meditates day and night.
c64329	He is like a tree
c64330	planted by streams of water,
c64331	yielding its fruit in season,
c64332	whose leaf does not wither,
c64333	and
c64334	in all he does.
c64335	who prospers
c64336	Not so the wicked!
c64337	For [they are] like chaff
c64338	driven off by the wind.
c64339	Therefore the wicked {will} not stand in the judgment,
c64340	nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
c64341	For the LORD guards the path of the righteous,
c64342	but the way of the wicked will perish.
c64343	Why do the nations rage
c64344	and the peoples plot in vain?
c64345	The kings of the earth take their stand
c64346	and the rulers gather together, against the LORD and against His Anointed One:
c64347	“Let us break Their chains
c64348	and cast away Their cords.”
c64349	The One enthroned in the heavens
c64350	laughs;
c64351	the Lord taunts them.
c64352	Then He rebukes them in His anger,
c64353	and terrifies them in His fury:
c64354	“I have installed My King on Zion, [upon] My holy hill.”
c64355	I will proclaim the decree ... by the LORD:
c64356	spoken to Me
c64357	“You [are] My Son;
c64358	today I have become Your Father.
c64359	Ask Me,
c64360	and I {will} make the nations Your inheritance,
c64361	the ends of the earth Your possession.
c64362	You will break them an iron scepter;
c64363	You {will} shatter them like pottery.”
c64364	Therefore
c64365	O kings;
c64366	be wise,
c64367	be admonished,
c64368	O judges of the earth.
c64369	Serve the LORD with fear,
c64370	and rejoice with trembling.
c64371	Kiss the Son,
c64372	lest He be angry
c64373	and you perish in your rebellion,
c64374	when His wrath ignites in an instant.
c64375	Blessed [are] all
c64376	who take refuge in Him.
c64377	A Psalm of David,
c64378	when he fled from his son Absalom.
c64379	O LORD,
c64380	how my foes have increased!
c64381	How many rise up against me!
c64382	Many say of me,
c64383	“God will not deliver him.”
c64384	Selah
c64385	But You,
c64386	O LORD,
c64387	are a shield around me,
c64388	my glory,
c64389	and the One who lifts my head.
c64390	To the LORD I cry aloud,
c64391	and He answers me from His holy hill.
c64392	Selah
c64393	I lie down
c64394	and sleep;
c64395	I wake again,
c64396	for the LORD sustains me.
c64397	I will not fear the myriads
c64398	set against me on every side.
c64399	Arise,
c64400	O LORD!
c64401	Deliver me,
c64402	O my God!
c64403	Strike all my enemies on the jaw;
c64404	break the teeth of the wicked.
c64405	Salvation belongs to the LORD;
c64406	may Your blessing be on Your people.
c64407	Selah
c64408	For the choirmaster.
c64409	With stringed instruments.
c64410	A Psalm of David.
c64411	me when I call,
c64412	Answer
c64413	O God of my righteousness!
c64414	You have relieved my distress;
c64415	show me grace
c64416	and hear my prayer.
c64417	O men,
c64418	How long, ... will my honor be maligned?
c64419	How long will you love vanity
c64420	and seek after lies?
c64421	Selah
c64422	Know
c64423	that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself;
c64424	the LORD will hear
c64425	when I call to Him.
c64426	Be angry,
c64427	yet do not sin;
c64428	on your bed, search your heart
c64429	and be still.
c64430	Selah
c64431	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness
c64432	and trust in the LORD.
c64433	Many ask,
c64434	“Who can show us the good?”
c64435	Shine the light of Your face upon us,
c64436	O LORD.
c64437	You have filled my heart with more joy than when
c64438	grain and new wine abound.
c64439	I will lie down ... in peace,
c64440	and sleep
c64441	for You
c64442	O LORD,
c64443	alone, ... make me dwell in safety.
c64444	For the choirmaster,
c64445	to be accompanied by flutes.
c64446	A Psalm of David.
c64447	Give ear to my words,
c64448	O LORD;
c64449	consider my groaning.
c64450	Attend to the sound of my cry,
c64451	my King and my God,
c64452	for to You I pray.
c64453	O LORD,
c64454	In the morning, ... You hear my voice;
c64455	at daybreak I lay [my plea] before You
c64456	and wait in expectation.
c64457	For ... are not a God
c64458	who delights in wickedness;
c64459	You
c64460	no evil can dwell with You.
c64461	The boastful cannot stand in Your presence;
c64462	You hate all workers of iniquity.
c64463	You destroy those who tell lies;
c64464	the LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.
c64465	But I, by the abundance of Your loving devotion, will enter Your house;
c64466	in reverence I will bow down toward Your holy temple.
c64467	O LORD,
c64468	Lead me, ... in Your righteousness because of my enemies;
c64469	make straight Your way before me.
c64470	For not a word they speak can be trusted;
c64471	destruction is within them.
c64472	Their throats are open graves;
c64473	their tongues practice flattery.
c64474	Declare them guilty,
c64475	O God;
c64476	let them fall by their own devices.
c64477	Drive them out for their many transgressions,
c64478	for they have rebelled against You.
c64479	But let all ... rejoice;
c64480	who take refuge in You
c64481	let them ever shout for joy.
c64482	May You shelter them,
c64483	that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.
c64484	For surely You, ... bless the righteous;
c64485	O LORD,
c64486	You surround them with the shield of your favor.
c64487	For the choirmaster.
c64488	With stringed instruments,
c64489	according to Sheminith.
c64490	A Psalm of David.
c64491	O LORD,
c64492	do not rebuke me in Your anger,
c64493	or discipline me in Your wrath.
c64494	Be merciful to me,
c64495	O LORD,
c64496	for I am frail;
c64497	heal me,
c64498	O LORD,
c64499	for my bones are in agony.
c64500	My soul is deeply distressed.
c64501	O
c64502	LORD,
c64503	How long, ... how long?
c64504	Turn,
c64505	O LORD,
c64506	[and] deliver my soul;
c64507	save me because of Your loving devotion.
c64508	For there is no mention of You in death;
c64509	from Sheol?
c64510	who can praise You
c64511	I am weary from groaning;
c64512	all night I flood my bed with {weeping}
c64513	[and] drench my couch with tears.
c64514	My eyes fail from grief;
c64515	they grow dim because of all my foes.
c64516	Depart from me,
c64517	all you workers of iniquity,
c64518	for the LORD has heard my weeping.
c64519	The LORD has heard my cry for mercy;
c64520	the LORD accepts my prayer.
c64521	will be ashamed
c64522	All my enemies ... and dismayed;
c64523	they will turn back
c64524	in sudden disgrace.
c64525	A Shiggaion of David,
c64526	which he sang to the LORD about Cush, a Benjamite.
c64527	O LORD my God,
c64528	I take refuge in You;
c64529	save me ... from all my pursuers,
c64530	and deliver me
c64531	or they will shred my soul like a lion,
c64532	and tear me to pieces
c64533	with no one to rescue me.
c64534	O LORD my God,
c64535	if I have done this,
c64536	if injustice is on my hands,
c64537	if I have rewarded my ally with evil,
c64538	if I have plundered
c64539	my foe without cause,
c64540	then may my enemy pursue ... me;
c64541	and overtake
c64542	may he trample me to the ground
c64543	and leave my honor in the dust.
c64544	Selah
c64545	Arise,
c64546	O LORD,
c64547	in Your anger;
c64548	rise up against the fury of my enemies.
c64549	Awake, my God,
c64550	and ordain judgment.
c64551	Let the assembled peoples encompass You;
c64552	take Your seat over them on high.
c64553	The LORD judges the peoples;
c64554	vindicate me,
c64555	O LORD,
c64556	according to my righteousness and integrity.
c64557	Put an end to the evil of the wicked, ... O
c64558	but establish the righteous,
c64559	righteous God who searches hearts and minds.
c64560	My shield is with God,
c64561	who saves the upright in heart.
c64562	God is a righteous judge
c64563	and a God
c64564	who feels indignation each day.
c64565	If one does not repent,
c64566	God will sharpen His sword;
c64567	He has bent ... His bow.
c64568	and strung
c64569	He has prepared His deadly weapons;
c64570	He ordains His arrows with fire.
c64571	Behold, [the wicked man] travails with evil;
c64572	he conceives trouble
c64573	and births falsehood.
c64574	He has dug a hole
c64575	and hollowed it out;
c64576	he has fallen into the pit
c64577	of his making.
c64578	His trouble recoils on himself,
c64579	and his violence falls on his own head.
c64580	I will thank the LORD for His righteousness
c64581	and sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
c64582	For the choirmaster.
c64583	According to Gittith.
c64584	A Psalm of David.
c64585	O LORD, our Lord,
c64586	how majestic is Your name in all the earth!
c64587	You have set Your glory above the heavens.
c64588	From the lips of children and infants You have ordained praise on account of Your adversaries,
c64589	to silence the enemy and avenger.
c64590	When I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,
c64591	the moon and the stars,
c64592	which You set in place—
c64593	what is man
c64594	that You are mindful [of him],
c64595	or the son of man
c64596	that You care for him?
c64597	You made him a little lower than the angels;
c64598	you crowned him with glory and honor.
c64599	You made him ruler of the works of Your hands;
c64600	You have placed everything under his feet:
c64601	all sheep and oxen,
c64602	and even the beasts of the field,
c64603	the birds of the air,
c64604	and the fish of the sea,
c64605	all that swim the paths of the seas.
c64606	O LORD, our Lord,
c64607	how majestic is Your name in all the earth!
c64608	For the choirmaster.
c64609	To [the tune of] “The Death of the Son.”
c64610	A Psalm of David.
c64611	I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart;
c64612	I will recount all Your wonders.
c64613	I will be glad
c64614	and rejoice in You;
c64615	I will sing praise to Your name,
c64616	O Most High.
c64617	When my enemies retreat,
c64618	they stumble
c64619	and perish before You.
c64620	For You have upheld my just cause;
c64621	You sit on Your throne judging righteously.
c64622	You have rebuked the nations;
c64623	You have destroyed the wicked;
c64624	You have erased their name forever and ever.
c64625	The enemy
c64626	has come to eternal ruin,
c64627	and You have uprooted their cities;
c64628	the very memory of them has vanished.
c64629	But the LORD abides forever;
c64630	He has established His throne for judgment.
c64631	He judges the world with justice;
c64632	He will govern the people with equity.
c64633	The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed,
c64634	a stronghold in times of trouble.
c64635	Those who know Your name will trust in You,
c64636	for ... have not abandoned those who seek You.
c64637	You, O LORD,
c64638	Sing praises to the LORD,
c64639	who dwells in Zion;
c64640	proclaim His deeds among the nations.
c64641	For the Avenger of bloodshed
c64642	remembers;
c64643	He does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.
c64644	Be merciful to me,
c64645	O LORD;
c64646	see how my enemies afflict me!
c64647	Snatch me from the gates of death,
c64648	that I may declare all Your praises— that within the gates of Daughter Zion
c64649	I may rejoice in Your salvation.
c64650	The nations have fallen into a pit
c64651	of their making;
c64652	in the net
c64653	they have hidden.
c64654	their feet are snared
c64655	The LORD is known
c64656	by the justice He brings;
c64657	the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.
c64658	Higgaion
c64659	Selah
c64660	The wicked will return to Sheol—
c64661	all the nations
c64662	who forget God.
c64663	For the needy {will} not always be forgotten;
c64664	nor the hope of the oppressed forever dashed.
c64665	Rise up,
c64666	O LORD,
c64667	let not man prevail;
c64668	let the nations be judged in Your presence.
c64669	Lay
c64670	upon them, [O LORD];
c64671	terror ... they
c64672	let the nations know
c64673	are but men.
c64674	Selah
c64675	Why,
c64676	O LORD,
c64677	do You stand far off?
c64678	Why do You hide in times of trouble?
c64679	In pride the wicked pursue the needy;
c64680	let them be caught in the schemes
c64681	they devise.
c64682	For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart;
c64683	he blesses the greedy
c64684	and reviles the LORD.
c64685	In his pride the wicked [man] does not seek [Him];
c64686	there is no God.
c64687	in all his schemes
c64688	He is secure in his ways at all times;
c64689	Your lofty judgments are far from him;
c64690	at all his foes.
c64691	he sneers
c64692	He says to himself,
c64693	“I shall not be moved; from age to age
c64694	I am free of distress.”
c64695	His mouth is full of cursing,
c64696	deceit, and violence;
c64697	trouble and malice are under his tongue.
c64698	He lies in wait near the villages;
c64699	in ambush he slays the innocent;
c64700	his eyes watch in stealth for the helpless.
c64701	He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket;
c64702	he lurks
c64703	to seize the oppressed;
c64704	he catches the lowly
c64705	in his dragnet.
c64706	They are crushed
c64707	and beaten down;
c64708	the hapless fall prey to his strength.
c64709	He says to himself,
c64710	“God has forgotten;
c64711	He hides His face
c64712	and never sees.”
c64713	Arise,
c64714	O LORD! ... O God.
c64715	Lift up Your hand,
c64716	Do not forget the helpless.
c64717	Why has the wicked man renounced God?
c64718	He says to himself,
c64719	“You will never call [me] to account.”
c64720	have regarded
c64721	But You ... trouble and grief; You consider it
c64722	to take in hand.
c64723	The victim entrusts himself to You;
c64724	You are the helper of the fatherless.
c64725	Break the arm of the wicked
c64726	and evildoer;
c64727	call his wickedness into account
c64728	until none is left to find.
c64729	The LORD is King forever and ever;
c64730	the nations will vanish from His land.
c64731	You have heard, ... the desire of the humble;
c64732	O LORD,
c64733	You will strengthen their hearts.
c64734	You will incline Your ear,
c64735	to vindicate the fatherless and oppressed,
c64736	no more.
c64737	may strike terror
c64738	that the men of the earth
c64739	For the choirmaster.
c64740	Of David.
c64741	In the LORD I take refuge.
c64742	So how can you say to me,
c64743	“Flee to your mountain
c64744	like a bird!
c64745	For behold, the wicked bend [their] bows;
c64746	they set their arrow on the string
c64747	to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
c64748	If the foundations are destroyed,
c64749	can the righteous
c64750	what ... do?”
c64751	The LORD is in His holy temple;
c64752	the LORD
c64753	is on His heavenly throne.
c64754	His eyes are watching closely;
c64755	[they] examine the sons of men.
c64756	The LORD tests the righteous
c64757	and the wicked; His soul hates the lover of violence.
c64758	On the wicked He will rain fiery coals and brimstone;
c64759	a scorching wind will be their portion.
c64760	For the LORD is righteous;
c64761	He loves justice.
c64762	The upright will see His face.
c64763	For the choirmaster.
c64764	According to Sheminith.
c64765	A Psalm of David.
c64766	Help,
c64767	O LORD,
c64768	for the godly are no more;
c64769	the faithful have vanished from among men.
c64770	They lie
c64771	to one another;
c64772	they speak with flattering lips and a double heart.
c64773	May the LORD cut off all flattering lips,
c64774	and the tongue
c64775	that speaks proud things.
c64776	They say,
c64777	“With our tongues we will prevail.
c64778	We own our lips—
c64779	who can be our master?”
c64780	“For the cause of the oppressed and the groaning of the needy, I will now arise,”
c64781	says the LORD.
c64782	“I will bring safety
c64783	to him who yearns.”
c64784	The words of the LORD are flawless,
c64785	like silver
c64786	refined in a furnace, like gold
c64787	purified sevenfold.
c64788	You,
c64789	O LORD,
c64790	will keep us;
c64791	You will forever guard us from ... generation.
c64792	this
c64793	The wicked wander freely,
c64794	and vileness is exalted among men.
c64795	For the choirmaster.
c64796	A Psalm of David.
c64797	How long, ... me
c64798	O LORD?
c64799	Will You forget ... forever?
c64800	How long will You hide Your face from me?
c64801	How long must I wrestle in my soul,
c64802	with sorrow in my heart each day?
c64803	How long will my enemy dominate me?
c64804	See me
c64805	[and] respond,
c64806	O LORD my God.
c64807	Give light to my eyes,
c64808	lest I sleep in death,
c64809	lest my enemy say,
c64810	“I have overcome him,”
c64811	and my foes rejoice
c64812	when I fall.
c64813	But I have trusted in Your loving devotion;
c64814	my heart will rejoice in Your salvation.
c64815	I will sing to the LORD,
c64816	for He has been good to me.
c64817	For the choirmaster.
c64818	Of David.
c64819	The fool says in his heart,
c64820	“[There is] no God.”
c64821	They are corrupt;
c64822	their acts are vile.
c64823	There is no one who does good.
c64824	The LORD looks down from heaven upon the sons of men
c64825	to see
c64826	if any understand,
c64827	if any seek God.
c64828	All have turned away,
c64829	they have together become corrupt;
c64830	there is no one who does good,
c64831	not even one.
c64832	Will the workers of iniquity never learn?
c64833	They devour my people [like] bread;
c64834	they refuse to call upon the LORD.
c64835	There they are, overwhelmed with dread,
c64836	for God [is] in the company of the righteous.
c64837	You [sinners] frustrate the plans of the oppressed,
c64838	yet the LORD is their shelter.
c64839	Oh, that ... would come
c64840	the salvation of Israel ... from Zion!
c64841	When the LORD restores His captive people,
c64842	let Jacob rejoice,
c64843	let Israel be glad.
c64844	A Psalm of David.
c64845	O LORD,
c64846	who may abide in Your tent?
c64847	Who may dwell on Your holy hill?
c64848	He who walks with integrity
c64849	and practices righteousness,
c64850	who speaks the truth from his heart,
c64851	who has no slander on his tongue,
c64852	who does no harm to his neighbor,
c64853	who casts no scorn on his friend,
c64854	who despises the vile
c64855	but honors those who fear the LORD,
c64856	oath,
c64857	a costly
c64858	who does not revise
c64859	who lends his money without interest
c64860	and refuses a bribe against the innocent. ... will never
c64861	He who does these things
c64862	be shaken.
c64863	A Miktam of David.
c64864	Preserve me,
c64865	O God,
c64866	for in You I take refuge.
c64867	I said to the LORD,
c64868	“You are my Lord;
c64869	apart from You I have no good thing.”
c64870	As for the saints
c64871	in the land, they
c64872	are the excellence
c64873	in whom all my delight resides.
c64874	Sorrows will multiply
c64875	to those who chase other gods.
c64876	I will not pour out their libations of blood,
c64877	or speak their names with my lips.
c64878	The LORD [is] my chosen portion and my cup;
c64879	You have made my lot {secure}.
c64880	The lines of my {boundary} have fallen in pleasant places;
c64881	surely my inheritance is delightful.
c64882	I will bless the LORD
c64883	who counsels me;
c64884	even at night my conscience instructs me.
c64885	I have set the LORD always before me.
c64886	Because He is at my right hand,
c64887	I will not be shaken.
c64888	Therefore my heart is glad
c64889	and my tongue rejoices;
c64890	my body also will dwell securely.
c64891	For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol,
c64892	nor will You let Your Holy One
c64893	see decay.
c64894	You have made known to me the path of life;
c64895	You will fill me with joy in Your presence
c64896	with eternal pleasures at Your right hand.
c64897	A Prayer of David.
c64898	Hear,
c64899	O LORD,
c64900	my righteous plea;
c64901	listen to my cry.
c64902	Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit.
c64903	May my vindication come from Your presence;
c64904	may Your eyes see what is right.
c64905	You have tried my heart;
c64906	You have visited [me] in the night.
c64907	You have tested me
c64908	and found no [evil];
c64909	I have resolved
c64910	not to sin with my mouth.
c64911	As for the deeds of men— by the word of Your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.
c64912	My steps have clung to Your paths;
c64913	my feet have not slipped.
c64914	I call on You,
c64915	for You will answer me.
c64916	O God,
c64917	Incline Your ear to me;
c64918	hear my words.
c64919	Show the wonders of Your loving devotion,
c64920	You who save
c64921	those who seek refuge
c64922	by Your right hand ... from their foes.
c64923	Keep me as the apple of Your eye;
c64924	hide me in the shadow of Your wings
c64925	from the wicked
c64926	who assail me,
c64927	from my mortal enemies
c64928	who surround me.
c64929	They have closed their callous [hearts];
c64930	their mouths speak with arrogance.
c64931	They have tracked us down, and now surround us;
c64932	their eyes are set
c64933	to cast [us] to the ground,
c64934	like a lion
c64935	greedy
c64936	for prey,
c64937	like a young lion
c64938	lurking in ambush.
c64939	Arise,
c64940	O LORD,
c64941	confront them!
c64942	Bring them to their knees;
c64943	deliver me from the wicked by Your sword,
c64944	from such men, ... by Your hand,
c64945	O LORD,
c64946	from men of the world
c64947	whose portion is in this life.
c64948	You fill their bellies with Your treasure
c64949	and satisfy their sons;
c64950	so they leave their abundance to their children.
c64951	As for me, I will behold Your face in righteousness;
c64952	I will be satisfied
c64953	when I awake,
c64954	with Your presence.
c64955	For the choirmaster.
c64956	Of David the servant of the LORD,
c64957	who sang this song to the LORD on the day
c64958	the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
c64959	He said:
c64960	I love You,
c64961	O LORD, my strength.
c64962	The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.
c64963	My God [is] my rock,
c64964	in whom I take refuge,
c64965	my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
c64966	I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised;
c64967	so shall I be saved from my enemies.
c64968	The cords of death encompassed me;
c64969	the torrents of chaos overwhelmed me.
c64970	The cords of Sheol entangled me;
c64971	the snares of death confronted me.
c64972	In my distress I called upon the LORD
c64973	and I cried to my God for help.
c64974	From His temple He heard my voice,
c64975	and my cry for His help reached His ears.
c64976	shook
c64977	Then the earth ... and quaked,
c64978	and the foundations of the mountains trembled;
c64979	they were shaken
c64980	because He burned with anger.
c64981	Smoke rose from His nostrils,
c64982	and consuming fire came from His mouth;
c64983	glowing coals flamed forth.
c64984	He parted the heavens
c64985	and came down
c64986	with dark clouds was under His feet.
c64987	He mounted a cherub
c64988	and flew;
c64989	He soared on the wings of the wind.
c64990	He made darkness His hiding place,
c64991	[and] storm clouds a canopy around Him.
c64992	From the brightness of His presence, His clouds advanced—
c64993	hailstones and coals of fire.
c64994	The LORD thundered from heaven;
c64995	the voice of the Most High resounded—
c64996	hailstones and coals of fire.
c64997	He shot His arrows
c64998	and scattered [the foes];
c64999	He hurled lightning
c65000	and routed them.
c65001	The channels of the sea appeared,
c65002	the foundations of the world were exposed, at Your rebuke,
c65003	O LORD,
c65004	at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
c65005	He reached from on high
c65006	and took hold of me;
c65007	He drew me out of deep waters.
c65008	He rescued me from my powerful enemy and from foes
c65009	too mighty for me.
c65010	They confronted me in my day of calamity,
c65011	but the LORD was my support.
c65012	He brought me out into the open;
c65013	He rescued me
c65014	because He delighted in me.
c65015	The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness;
c65016	He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.
c65017	For I have kept the ways of the LORD
c65018	and have not wickedly departed from my God.
c65019	For all His ordinances [are] before me;
c65020	I have not disregarded His statutes.
c65021	And I have been blameless before Him
c65022	and kept myself from iniquity.
c65023	So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness,
c65024	according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.
c65025	To the faithful You show Yourself faithful,
c65026	to the blameless You show Yourself blameless,
c65027	to the pure You show Yourself pure,
c65028	but to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd.
c65029	For You save an afflicted people,
c65030	but You humble those with haughty eyes.
c65031	For You, ... light my lamp;
c65032	O LORD, ... my God enlightens my darkness.
c65033	For in You I can charge an army,
c65034	and with my God I can scale a wall.
c65035	[As for] God,
c65036	His way is perfect;
c65037	the word of the LORD is flawless.
c65038	He is a shield to all
c65039	who take refuge in Him.
c65040	For who is God besides the LORD?
c65041	And who [is] the rock except our God?
c65042	[It is] God
c65043	who arms me with strength
c65044	and makes my way blameless.
c65045	He makes my feet like the feet of a deer
c65046	and stations me upon the heights.
c65047	He trains my hands for battle;
c65048	my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
c65049	You have given me Your shield of salvation;
c65050	Your right hand upholds me,
c65051	and Your gentleness exalts me.
c65052	You broaden the path beneath me
c65053	so that my ankles do not give way.
c65054	I pursued my enemies
c65055	and overtook them;
c65056	I did not turn back
c65057	until they were consumed.
c65058	I crushed them
c65059	so they could not
c65060	rise;
c65061	they have fallen under my feet.
c65062	You have armed me with strength for battle;
c65063	You have subdued my foes beneath me.
c65064	my enemies
c65065	You have made ... retreat before me;
c65066	to those who hated me.
c65067	I put an end
c65068	They cried for help,
c65069	but [there was] no one to save them—
c65070	to the LORD,
c65071	but He did not answer.
c65072	I ground them as dust in the face of the wind;
c65073	I trampled them like mud in the streets.
c65074	You have delivered me from the strife of the people;
c65075	You have made me the head of nations;
c65076	a people
c65077	I had not known
c65078	shall serve me.
c65079	When they hear me, they obey me;
c65080	foreigners cower before me.
c65081	Foreigners lose heart
c65082	and come trembling from their strongholds.
c65083	The LORD lives!
c65084	Blessed be my rock!
c65085	And {may} the God of my salvation be exalted—
c65086	the God
c65087	who avenges me
c65088	and subdues nations beneath me,
c65089	who delivers me from my enemies.
c65090	You exalt me above my foes;
c65091	You rescue me from violent men.
c65092	Therefore I will praise You, ... among the nations;
c65093	O LORD,
c65094	I will sing praises to Your name!
c65095	{He brings} great salvation to His king.
c65096	He shows loving devotion to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.
c65097	For the choirmaster.
c65098	A Psalm of David.
c65099	The heavens declare the glory of God;
c65100	the skies proclaim the work of His hands.
c65101	Day after day they pour forth speech;
c65102	night after night they reveal knowledge.
c65103	Without speech
c65104	or language,
c65105	without a sound to be heard,
c65106	their voice has gone out into all the earth,
c65107	their words to the ends of the world.
c65108	In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun
c65109	like a bridegroom
c65110	emerging from his chamber,
c65111	like a champion rejoicing
c65112	to run his course.
c65113	It rises at one end of the heavens
c65114	and runs its circuit to the other;
c65115	nothing is deprived of its warmth.
c65116	The law of the LORD is perfect,
c65117	reviving the soul;
c65118	the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy,
c65119	making wise the simple.
c65120	The precepts of the LORD are right,
c65121	bringing joy to the heart;
c65122	the commandments of the LORD are radiant,
c65123	giving light to the eyes.
c65124	The fear of the LORD is pure,
c65125	enduring forever;
c65126	the judgments of the LORD are true,
c65127	being altogether righteous.
c65128	They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold;
c65129	they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.
c65130	By them indeed Your servant is warned; in
c65131	keeping them
c65132	[is] great reward.
c65133	Who can discern his own errors?
c65134	Cleanse me from my hidden faults.
c65135	Keep Your servant also from willful sins;
c65136	may they not rule over me.
c65137	Then I will be blameless
c65138	and cleansed of great transgression.
c65139	May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight,
c65140	O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.
c65141	For the choirmaster.
c65142	A Psalm of David.
c65143	May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble;
c65144	may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
c65145	May He send you help from the sanctuary
c65146	and sustain you from Zion.
c65147	May He remember all your gifts
c65148	and look favorably on your burnt offerings.
c65149	Selah
c65150	May He give you the desires of your heart
c65151	and make all your plans {succeed}.
c65152	May we shout for joy at your victory
c65153	and raise a banner in the name of our God.
c65154	May the LORD sanction all your petitions.
c65155	Now I know
c65156	that the LORD saves His anointed;
c65157	He answers him from His holy heaven with the saving power of His right hand.
c65158	Some [trust] in chariots
c65159	and others in horses,
c65160	but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.
c65161	They collapse
c65162	and fall,
c65163	but we rise up
c65164	and stand firm.
c65165	O LORD,
c65166	deliver
c65167	the king. Answer us on the day
c65168	we call.
c65169	For the choirmaster.
c65170	A Psalm of David.
c65171	O LORD,
c65172	the king rejoices in Your strength.
c65173	in Your salvation!
c65174	How greatly he exults
c65175	You have granted his heart’s desire
c65176	and have not withheld the request of his lips.
c65177	Selah
c65178	For You welcomed him with rich blessings;
c65179	You placed on his head a crown of pure gold.
c65180	He asked You for life,
c65181	and You granted it— length of days, forever and ever.
c65182	Great is his glory in Your salvation;
c65183	You bestow on him splendor and majesty.
c65184	For You grant him blessings forever;
c65185	You cheer him with joy in Your presence.
c65186	For the king trusts in the LORD;
c65187	through the loving devotion of the Most High, he will not be shaken.
c65188	Your hand will apprehend all your enemies;
c65189	Your right hand will seize those who hate you.
c65190	You will place them in a fiery furnace at the time of Your appearing.
c65191	In His wrath the LORD will engulf them,
c65192	and the fire will consume them.
c65193	You will wipe their descendants from the earth,
c65194	and their offspring from the sons of men.
c65195	Though they intend You harm,
c65196	the schemes they devise
c65197	will not prevail.
c65198	For You will put them to flight
c65199	when Your bow is trained upon them.
c65200	Be exalted,
c65201	O LORD,
c65202	in Your strength;
c65203	we will sing
c65204	and praise Your power.
c65205	For the choirmaster.
c65206	To the tune of “The Doe of the Dawn.”
c65207	A Psalm of David.
c65208	My God, my God,
c65209	why have You forsaken me?
c65210	Why are You so far from saving me, [so far] from my words of groaning?
c65211	O my God,
c65212	I cry out by day,
c65213	but You do not answer,
c65214	and by night,
c65215	but I have no rest.
c65216	Yet You are holy,
c65217	enthroned on the praises of Israel.
c65218	In You our fathers trusted;
c65219	they trusted
c65220	and You delivered them.
c65221	They cried out to You
c65222	and were set free;
c65223	they trusted in You
c65224	and were not disappointed.
c65225	But I am a worm
c65226	and not a man,
c65227	scorned by men
c65228	and despised by the people.
c65229	All
c65230	who see me
c65231	mock me;
c65232	they sneer
c65233	and shake their heads:
c65234	“He trusts in the LORD,
c65235	let the LORD deliver him;
c65236	let the LORD rescue him,
c65237	since He delights in him.”
c65238	Yet You brought me out of the womb;
c65239	You secured me at my mother’s breast.
c65240	From birth I was cast upon You;
c65241	from my mother’s womb You have been my God.
c65242	Be not far from me,
c65243	for trouble is near
c65244	and there is no one to help.
c65245	Many bulls surround me;
c65246	strong [bulls] of Bashan encircle me.
c65247	They open their jaws against me like lions
c65248	and maul.
c65249	that roar
c65250	I am poured out like water,
c65251	and all my bones are disjointed.
c65252	My heart is like wax;
c65253	it melts away within me.
c65254	My strength is dried up like a potsherd,
c65255	and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.
c65256	You lay me in the dust of death.
c65257	For dogs surround me;
c65258	a band of evil men encircles me;
c65259	they have pierced my hands and feet.
c65260	I can count all my bones;
c65261	they stare
c65262	and gloat over me.
c65263	They divide my garments among them
c65264	and cast lots for my clothing.
c65265	But You,
c65266	O LORD,
c65267	be not far off;
c65268	O my strength,
c65269	come quickly to help.
c65270	Deliver my soul from the sword,
c65271	my precious life from the power of wild dogs.
c65272	Save me from the mouth of the lion;
c65273	at the horns of the wild oxen You have answered Me!
c65274	I will proclaim Your name to my brothers;
c65275	I will praise You in the assembly.
c65276	You who fear the LORD,
c65277	praise Him!
c65278	All descendants of Jacob,
c65279	honor Him!
c65280	revere Him!
c65281	All offspring of Israel,
c65282	For He has not despised
c65283	or detested the torment of the afflicted.
c65284	He has not hidden His face from him,
c65286	to his cry for help.
c65287	but has attended
c65288	From You comes my praise in the great assembly;
c65289	before those who fear You I will fulfill my vows.
c65290	The poor will eat
c65291	and be satisfied;
c65292	the LORD will praise Him.
c65293	those who seek
c65294	May your hearts live forever!
c65295	will remember
c65296	All the ends of the earth ... and turn to the LORD.
c65297	All the families of the nations will bow down before Him.
c65298	For dominion belongs to the LORD
c65299	and He rules over the nations.
c65300	will feast
c65301	All the rich of the earth ... and worship; ... before Him—
c65302	all ... will kneel
c65303	who go down to the dust
c65304	even those unable to preserve their lives.
c65305	Posterity will serve Him;
c65306	they will declare the Lord to a new generation.
c65307	They will come
c65308	and proclaim His righteousness to a people
c65309	yet unborn—
c65310	all that He has done.
c65311	A Psalm of David.
c65312	The LORD is my shepherd;
c65313	I shall not want.
c65314	He makes me lie down in green pastures;
c65315	He leads me beside quiet waters.
c65316	He restores my soul;
c65317	He guides me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of His name.
c65318	Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
c65319	I will fear no evil,
c65320	for You are with me;
c65321	Your rod and Your staff,
c65322	they comfort me.
c65323	You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
c65324	You anoint my head with oil;
c65325	my cup overflows.
c65326	Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life,
c65327	and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
c65328	of David.
c65329	A Psalm
c65330	The earth [is] the LORD’s, and the fullness thereof,
c65331	the world
c65332	and all who dwell therein.
c65333	For He has founded it upon the seas
c65334	and established it upon the waters.
c65335	Who may ascend the hill of the LORD?
c65336	Who may stand in His holy place?
c65337	He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
c65338	who does not lift up his soul to falsehood,
c65339	who does not swear deceitfully.
c65340	He shall receive blessing from the LORD,
c65341	and vindication from the God of his salvation.
c65342	Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face,
c65343	[O God] of Jacob.
c65344	Selah
c65345	Lift up
c65346	O gates!
c65347	your heads,
c65348	Be lifted up,
c65349	O ancient doors,
c65350	that the King of Glory may enter!
c65351	Who is this King of Glory?
c65352	The LORD strong and mighty,
c65353	the LORD mighty in battle.
c65354	Lift up
c65355	O gates!
c65356	your heads,
c65357	Be lifted up,
c65358	O ancient doors,
c65359	that the King of Glory may enter!
c65360	Who is He,
c65361	this King of Glory?
c65362	The LORD of Hosts—
c65363	He is the King of Glory.
c65364	Selah
c65365	Of David.
c65366	To You,
c65367	O LORD,
c65368	I lift up my soul;
c65369	my God,
c65370	In You, ... I trust.
c65371	Let me not be ashamed,
c65372	nor let my enemies exult over me.
c65373	Surely none who wait for You will be put to shame;
c65374	will be disgraced.
c65375	[but] those who are faithless without cause
c65376	Your ways,
c65377	O LORD;
c65378	Show me
c65379	teach me Your paths.
c65380	Guide me in Your truth
c65381	and teach me,
c65382	for You are the God of my salvation;
c65383	all day long I wait for You.
c65384	Remember, ... Your compassion
c65385	O LORD,
c65386	and loving devotion,
c65387	for they [are] from age to age.
c65388	Remember not the sins of my youth, or my rebellious acts;
c65389	remember me according to Your loving devotion, because of Your goodness,
c65390	O LORD.
c65391	Good and upright [is] the LORD;
c65392	therefore He shows sinners the way.
c65393	He guides the humble in what is right
c65394	and teaches them His way.
c65395	All the LORD’s ways [are] loving and faithful
c65396	to those who keep His covenant and His decrees.
c65397	For the sake of Your name,
c65398	O LORD,
c65399	forgive my iniquity,
c65400	for it is great.
c65401	Who is the man
c65402	who fears the LORD?
c65403	He will instruct him in the way
c65404	he should choose.
c65405	His soul will dwell in prosperity,
c65406	and his descendants will inherit the land.
c65407	The LORD confides in those who fear Him,
c65408	His covenant to them.
c65409	and reveals
c65410	My eyes are always on the LORD,
c65411	for He will free my feet from the mesh.
c65412	Turn to me
c65413	and be gracious,
c65414	for I am lonely and afflicted.
c65415	The troubles of my heart increase;
c65416	free me from my distress.
c65417	Consider my affliction and trouble,
c65418	and take away all my sins.
c65419	Consider my enemies,
c65420	for they are many,
c65421	and they hate me with vicious hatred.
c65422	Guard my soul
c65423	and deliver me;
c65424	let me not be put to shame,
c65425	for I take refuge in You.
c65426	May integrity and uprightness preserve me,
c65427	because I wait for You.
c65428	Redeem
c65429	O God,
c65430	Israel, ... from all its distress.
c65431	Of David.
c65432	Vindicate me,
c65433	O LORD!
c65434	For I have walked with integrity;
c65435	I have trusted in the LORD
c65436	without wavering.
c65437	Test me,
c65438	O LORD,
c65439	and try me;
c65440	examine my heart and mind.
c65441	For Your loving devotion is before my eyes,
c65442	and I have walked in Your truth.
c65443	I do not sit with deceitful men,
c65444	nor keep company with hypocrites.
c65445	I hate the mob of evildoers,
c65446	and refuse to sit with the wicked.
c65447	I wash my hands in innocence
c65448	that I may come near Your altar,
c65449	O LORD,
c65450	to raise my voice in thanksgiving
c65451	and declare all Your wonderful works.
c65452	O LORD,
c65453	I love the house where You dwell, the place where Your glory resides.
c65454	Do not take my soul away with sinners,
c65455	or my life with men of bloodshed,
c65456	in whose hands are wicked schemes,
c65457	whose right hands are full of bribes.
c65458	But I will walk with integrity;
c65459	redeem me
c65460	and be merciful to me.
c65461	My feet stand on level ground;
c65462	in the congregations I will bless the LORD.
c65463	Of David.
c65464	The LORD is my light and my salvation—
c65465	whom shall I fear?
c65466	The LORD is the stronghold of my life—
c65467	whom shall I dread?
c65468	When the wicked came upon me
c65469	to devour my flesh,
c65470	my enemies and foes
c65471	stumbled
c65472	and fell.
c65473	Though an army encamps around me,
c65474	my heart {will} not fear;
c65475	though a war breaks out against me,
c65476	I will keep my trust.
c65477	One thing I have asked of the LORD,
c65478	this is what I desire:
c65479	to dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life,
c65480	to gaze on the beauty of the LORD
c65481	and seek Him in His temple.
c65482	For in the day of trouble He will hide me in His shelter;
c65483	He will conceal me under the cover of His tent;
c65484	He will set me high upon a rock.
c65485	Then my head will be held high above my enemies around me.
c65486	At His tabernacle I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy;
c65487	I will sing
c65488	and make music to the LORD.
c65489	Hear,
c65490	O LORD,
c65491	my voice when I call;
c65492	be merciful
c65493	and answer me.
c65494	My heart said,
c65495	“Seek His face.”
c65496	Your face,
c65497	O LORD,
c65498	I will seek.
c65499	Hide not Your face from me,
c65500	nor turn away Your servant in anger.
c65501	You have been my helper;
c65502	do not leave me
c65503	or forsake me,
c65504	O God of my salvation.
c65505	Though my father and mother forsake me,
c65506	the LORD will receive me.
c65507	Teach me
c65508	O LORD,
c65509	Your way,
c65510	and lead me on a level path, because of my oppressors.
c65511	Do not hand me over to the will of my foes,
c65512	for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.
c65513	Still I am certain
c65514	to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
c65515	Wait patiently for the LORD;
c65516	be strong
c65517	and courageous.
c65518	Wait patiently for the LORD.
c65519	Of David.
c65520	To You,
c65521	O LORD,
c65522	I call;
c65523	O my rock.
c65524	be not deaf to me,
c65525	For if You remain silent
c65526	,I will be like
c65527	those descending to the Pit.
c65528	Hear my cry for mercy
c65529	when I call to You {for help},
c65530	when I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.
c65531	Do not drag me away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity,
c65532	who speak peace to their neighbors
c65533	while malice is in their hearts.
c65534	Repay them according to their deeds, and for their works of evil.
c65535	Repay them for what their hands have done;
c65536	bring back on them what they deserve.
c65537	Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD or what His hands have done,
c65538	He will tear them down
c65539	and never rebuild them.
c65540	Blessed be the LORD,
c65541	for He has heard my cry for mercy.
c65542	The LORD is my strength and my shield;
c65543	my heart trusts in Him,
c65544	and I am helped.
c65545	Therefore my heart rejoices,
c65546	and I will thank Him with my song.
c65547	The LORD is the strength of His people,
c65548	a stronghold of salvation for His anointed.
c65549	Save Your people
c65550	and bless Your inheritance;
c65551	shepherd them
c65552	and carry them forever.
c65553	A Psalm of David.
c65554	Ascribe to the LORD,
c65555	O heavenly beings,
c65556	ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
c65557	Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name;
c65558	worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness.
c65559	The voice of the LORD is over the waters;
c65560	the God of glory thunders;
c65561	the LORD [is heard] over many waters.
c65562	The voice of the LORD [is] powerful;
c65563	the voice of the LORD [is] majestic.
c65564	The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars;
c65565	the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon.
c65566	skip like a calf,
c65567	He makes Lebanon ... and Sirion like a young wild ox.
c65568	The voice of the LORD strikes with flames of fire.
c65569	The voice of the LORD shakes the desert;
c65570	the LORD shakes the Desert of Kadesh.
c65571	The voice of the LORD twists the oaks
c65572	and strips the forests bare.
c65573	And in His temple all cry, “Glory!”
c65574	The LORD sits enthroned over the flood;
c65575	the LORD is enthroned as King forever.
c65576	The LORD gives His people strength;
c65577	the LORD blesses His people with peace.
c65578	A Psalm. A Song for the dedication of the temple.
c65579	Of David.
c65580	I will exalt You,
c65581	O LORD,
c65582	for You have lifted me up
c65583	and have not allowed my foes to rejoice over me.
c65584	O LORD my God,
c65585	{I cried} to You for help,
c65586	and You healed me.
c65587	O LORD,
c65588	You pulled me up from Sheol;
c65589	You spared me
c65590	from descending into the Pit.
c65591	Sing to the LORD,
c65592	O you His saints,
c65593	and give thanks to His holy name.
c65594	For His anger is fleeting,
c65595	but His favor lasts a lifetime.
c65596	Weeping may stay the night,
c65597	but joy [comes] in the morning.
c65598	In prosperity I said,
c65599	“I will never be shaken.”
c65600	O LORD,
c65601	You favored me; You made my mountain {stand} strong.
c65602	When You hid Your face,
c65603	I was dismayed.
c65604	To You,
c65605	O LORD,
c65606	I called,
c65607	and I begged my Lord {for mercy}:
c65608	“What gain is in the shedding of my blood,
c65609	in my descent to the Pit?
c65610	Will the dust praise You?
c65611	Will it proclaim Your faithfulness?
c65612	Hear me,
c65613	O LORD,
c65614	and have mercy;
c65615	O LORD,
c65616	be my helper.”
c65617	You turned my mourning into dancing;
c65618	You peeled off my sackcloth
c65619	and clothed me with joy,
c65620	that my heart may sing Your praises
c65621	and not be silent.
c65622	O LORD my God,
c65623	I will give thanks forever.
c65624	For the choirmaster.
c65625	A Psalm of David. In You,
c65627	O LORD,
c65628	I take refuge;
c65629	let me never be put to shame;
c65630	save me by Your righteousness.
c65631	Incline Your ear to me;
c65632	come quickly to my rescue.
c65633	Be my rock of refuge,
c65634	the stronghold
c65635	of my deliverance.
c65636	For You are my rock and my fortress;
c65637	lead ... for the sake of Your name.
c65638	and guide me
c65639	You will free me from the net
c65640	laid for me,
c65641	for You are my refuge.
c65642	Into Your hands I commit my spirit;
c65643	You have redeemed me,
c65644	O LORD, God of truth.
c65645	I hate
c65646	those who cling to worthless idols,
c65647	but in the LORD I trust.
c65648	I will be glad
c65649	and rejoice in Your loving devotion,
c65650	for You have seen my affliction;
c65651	You have known the anguish of my soul.
c65652	You have not delivered me to the enemy;
c65653	You have set my feet in the open.
c65654	Be merciful to me,
c65655	O LORD,
c65656	for I am in distress;
c65657	my eyes fail from sorrow, my soul and body as well.
c65658	For my life is consumed with grief
c65659	and my years with groaning;
c65660	my iniquity has drained my strength
c65661	and my bones are wasting away.
c65662	Among all my enemies I am a disgrace
c65663	and among my neighbors all the more.
c65664	I am dreaded by my friends—
c65665	when they see me on the street.
c65666	they flee
c65667	I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind.
c65668	I am like a broken vessel.
c65669	For I hear the slander of many;
c65670	there is terror on every side.
c65671	They conspire against me
c65672	to take my life.
c65673	[and] plot
c65674	But I trust in You,
c65675	O LORD;
c65676	I say,
c65677	“You are my God.”
c65678	My times [are] in Your hands;
c65679	deliver me from my enemies and from those who pursue me.
c65680	Make Your face shine on Your servant;
c65681	save me by Your loving devotion.
c65682	O LORD,
c65683	let me not be ashamed,
c65684	for I have called on You.
c65685	Let the wicked be put to shame;
c65686	let them lie silent in Sheol.
c65687	May lying lips be silenced,
c65688	which speak with arrogance against the righteous, full of pride and contempt.
c65689	How great is Your goodness
c65690	which You have laid up for those who fear You,
c65691	and bestowed
c65692	on those who take refuge in You
c65693	in the sight of the sons of men.
c65694	You hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the schemes of men.
c65695	You conceal them in Your shelter from accusing tongues.
c65696	Blessed be the LORD,
c65697	for He has shown me His loving devotion in a city under siege.
c65698	In my alarm I said,
c65699	“I am cut off from Your sight!”
c65700	But You heard my plea for mercy
c65701	when I called to You for help.
c65702	Love the LORD,
c65703	all His saints.
c65704	The LORD preserves the faithful,
c65705	but fully repays the arrogant.
c65706	Be strong
c65707	and courageous,
c65708	all
c65709	you who hope in the LORD.
c65710	Of David.
c65711	A Maskil.
c65712	Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
c65713	Blessed is the man
c65714	whose sin the LORD does not count against him,
c65715	in whose spirit there is no deceit.
c65716	When I kept silent,
c65717	my bones became brittle from my groaning all day long.
c65718	For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me;
c65719	my strength was drained as in the summer heat.
c65720	Selah
c65721	Then I acknowledged my sin to You
c65722	and did not hide my iniquity.
c65723	I said,
c65724	“I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,”
c65725	and You forgave the guilt of my sin.
c65726	Selah
c65727	Therefore let all the godly pray to You while
c65728	You may be found.
c65729	Surely when great waters rise, they will not come near.
c65730	You are my hiding place.
c65731	You protect me from trouble;
c65732	with songs
c65733	of deliverance.
c65734	You surround me
c65735	Selah
c65736	I will instruct you
c65737	and teach you the way
c65738	you should go;
c65739	I will give you counsel [and] watch over you.
c65740	Do not be like the horse
c65741	or mule,
c65742	[which] have no understanding;
c65743	with bit and bridle
c65744	they must be controlled
c65745	[to make] them come to you.
c65746	Many are the sorrows of the wicked,
c65747	him who trusts in the LORD.
c65748	but loving devotion surrounds
c65749	Be glad in the LORD
c65750	and rejoice,
c65751	O righteous;
c65752	shout for joy,
c65753	all you upright in heart.
c65754	Rejoice
c65755	O you righteous;
c65756	in the LORD,
c65757	befitting is the praise of the upright.
c65758	Praise the LORD with the harp;
c65759	make music to Him with ten strings.
c65760	Sing to Him a new song;
c65761	skillfully
c65762	play ... with a shout of joy.
c65763	For the word of the LORD is upright,
c65764	and all His work is trustworthy.
c65765	[The LORD] loves righteousness and justice;
c65766	the earth is full of [His] loving devotion.
c65767	By the word of the LORD the heavens were made,
c65768	and all the stars by the breath of His mouth.
c65769	He piles up the waters of the sea;
c65770	He puts the depths into storehouses.
c65771	Let all the earth fear the LORD;
c65772	let all the people of the world revere Him.
c65773	For He spoke,
c65774	and it came to be;
c65775	He commanded,
c65776	and it stood fast.
c65777	The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations;
c65778	He thwarts the devices of the peoples.
c65779	The counsel of the LORD stands forever,
c65780	the purposes of His heart to all generations.
c65781	Blessed [is] the nation
c65782	whose God is the LORD,
c65783	the people
c65784	He has chosen as His inheritance!
c65785	The LORD looks down from heaven;
c65786	He sees all the sons of men.
c65787	From His dwelling place He gazes on all who inhabit the earth.
c65788	He shapes the hearts of each;
c65789	He considers all their works.
c65790	No king is saved by his vast army;
c65791	no warrior is delivered by his great strength.
c65792	A horse is a vain hope for salvation;
c65793	even its great strength cannot save.
c65794	Surely the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear Him,
c65795	on those whose hope is in His loving devotion
c65796	to deliver them from death
c65797	and keep them alive in famine.
c65798	Our soul waits for the LORD;
c65799	He is our help and our shield.
c65800	For our hearts rejoice in Him,
c65801	since we trust in His holy name.
c65802	May Your loving devotion rest
c65803	O LORD,
c65804	on us,
c65805	as we put our hope in You.
c65806	Of David,
c65807	when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech,
c65808	so that [the king] drove him
c65809	away.
c65810	I will bless the LORD at all times;
c65811	His praise will always be on my lips.
c65812	My soul will boast in the LORD;
c65813	let the oppressed hear
c65814	and rejoice.
c65815	Magnify the LORD with me;
c65816	let us exalt His name together.
c65817	I sought the LORD,
c65818	and He answered me;
c65819	He delivered me from all my fears.
c65820	Those who look to Him
c65821	are radiant with joy;
c65822	their faces shall never be ashamed.
c65823	This poor man called out,
c65824	and the LORD heard him;
c65825	He saved him from all his troubles.
c65826	The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him,
c65827	and he delivers them.
c65828	Taste
c65829	and see
c65830	that the LORD is good;
c65831	blessed is the man
c65832	who takes refuge in Him!
c65833	Fear the LORD,
c65834	you His saints,
c65835	for those who fear Him lack nothing.
c65836	Young lions go lacking
c65837	and hungry,
c65838	but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
c65839	Come,
c65840	children,
c65841	listen to me;
c65842	I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
c65843	Who is the man
c65844	who delights in life,
c65845	who desires ... days?
c65846	to see [many] good
c65847	Keep your tongue from evil
c65848	and your lips
c65849	from deceitful speech.
c65850	Turn away from evil
c65851	and do good;
c65852	seek peace
c65853	and pursue it.
c65854	The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous,
c65855	and His ears are inclined to their cry.
c65856	[But] the face of the LORD is against those who do evil,
c65857	to sever their memory from the earth.
c65858	The righteous cry out,
c65859	and the LORD hears;
c65860	He delivers them from all their troubles.
c65861	The LORD is near to the brokenhearted;
c65862	He saves the contrite in spirit.
c65863	Many [are] the afflictions of the righteous,
c65864	but the LORD delivers him from them all.
c65865	He protects all his bones;
c65866	not one of them will be broken.
c65867	Evil {will} slay the wicked,
c65868	and the haters of the righteous will be condemned.
c65869	The LORD redeems His servants,
c65870	and none ... will be condemned.
c65871	who take refuge in Him
c65872	Of David.
c65873	Contend
c65874	O LORD;
c65875	with my opponents,
c65876	fight against those who battle me.
c65877	Take up Your shield and buckler;
c65878	arise and come to my aid.
c65879	Draw the spear
c65880	and javelin
c65881	against my pursuers;
c65882	say to my soul:
c65883	“I [am] your salvation.”
c65884	be disgraced
c65885	and put to shame;
c65886	May those who seek my life
c65887	be driven back
c65888	and confounded.
c65889	may those who plan to harm me
c65890	May they be like chaff in the wind,
c65891	as the angel of the LORD drives them away.
c65892	May their path be dark and slick,
c65893	as the angel of the LORD pursues.
c65894	For without cause they laid their net for me; ... a pit
c65895	without reason they dug ... for my soul.
c65896	May ruin befall them
c65897	by surprise;
c65898	may the net
c65899	they hid
c65900	ensnare them;
c65901	their own destruction.
c65902	may they fall into
c65903	Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD
c65904	and exult in His salvation.
c65905	All my bones will exclaim,
c65906	O LORD,
c65907	“Who is like You,
c65908	who delivers the afflicted from the aggressor,
c65909	the poor and needy from the robber?”
c65910	Hostile witnesses come forward;
c65911	I know nothing {about}.
c65912	they make charges
c65913	They repay me evil for good, [to] the bereavement of my soul.
c65914	Yet
c65915	during their illness,
c65916	I put on sackcloth;
c65917	I humbled myself with fasting,
c65918	but my prayers returned unanswered.
c65919	I paced about as for my friend or brother;
c65920	I was bowed down with grief, like one mourning [for his] mother.
c65921	But when I stumbled, ... in glee;
c65922	they assembled
c65923	they gathered together against me. Assailants
c65924	I did not know
c65925	slandered me
c65926	without ceasing.
c65927	Like godless jesters at a feast, they gnashed their teeth at me.
c65928	O Lord,
c65929	How long, ... will You look on?
c65930	Rescue my soul from their ravages,
c65931	my precious life from these lions.
c65932	Then I will give You thanks in the great assembly;
c65933	I will praise You among many people.
c65934	Let not ... gloat over me
c65935	my enemies ... without cause,
c65936	or those who hate me without reason
c65937	wink in malice.
c65938	For they do not speak peace,
c65939	but devise deceitful schemes against those who live quietly in the land.
c65940	They gape at me
c65941	and say,
c65942	“Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen!”
c65943	You have seen it,
c65944	O LORD,
c65945	do not be silent.
c65946	O Lord,
c65947	be not far from me.
c65948	Awake
c65949	and rise to my defense,
c65950	my God and my Lord!
c65951	to my cause,
c65952	Vindicate me by Your righteousness,
c65953	O LORD my God,
c65954	and do not let them gloat over me.
c65955	Let them not say in their hearts,
c65956	“Aha, just what we wanted!”
c65957	Let them not say,
c65958	“We have swallowed him up!”
c65959	be ashamed
c65960	May those who gloat in my distress ... and confounded;
c65961	be clothed in shame and reproach.
c65962	may those who exalt themselves over me
c65963	shout for joy
c65964	May those who favor my vindication ... and gladness;
c65965	may they always say,
c65966	“Exalted be the LORD
c65967	who delights in His servant’s well-being.”
c65968	Then my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness
c65969	[and] Your praises all day long.
c65970	For the choirmaster.
c65971	A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD.
c65972	An oracle is in my heart regarding the transgression of the wicked man:
c65973	There is no fear of God before his eyes.
c65974	For his eyes are too full of conceit
c65975	to detect ... his own sin.
c65976	or hate
c65977	The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful;
c65978	he has ceased
c65979	to be wise
c65980	[and] well-doing.
c65981	Even on his bed he plots wickedness;
c65982	he sets himself on a path
c65983	that is not good;
c65984	he does not reject evil.
c65985	O LORD,
c65986	Your loving devotion, ... reaches to the heavens,
c65987	Your steadfastness to the clouds.
c65988	Your righteousness is like the highest mountains,
c65989	Your judgments like the deepest sea.
c65990	You preserve man and beast.
c65991	O LORD,
c65992	How precious is Your loving devotion,
c65993	O God,
c65994	that the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
c65995	They feast on the abundance of Your house,
c65996	and You give them drink from Your river of delights.
c65997	For with You is the fountain of life;
c65998	in Your light we see light.
c65999	Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You,
c66000	and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.
c66001	Let not the foot of the proud come against me,
c66002	nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
c66003	There ... lie fallen,
c66004	the evildoers
c66005	thrown down
c66006	and unable
c66007	to rise.
c66008	Of David.
c66009	Do not fret over doers of evil;
c66010	do not envy
c66011	those who do wrong.
c66012	For they wither quickly like grass
c66013	and wilt like tender plants.
c66014	Trust in the LORD
c66015	and do good;
c66016	dwell in the land
c66017	and cultivate faithfulness.
c66018	Delight yourself in the LORD,
c66019	and He will give you the desires of your heart.
c66020	Commit your way to the LORD;
c66021	trust in Him,
c66022	and He will do it.
c66023	He will bring forth your righteousness like the dawn,
c66024	your justice like the noonday sun.
c66025	Be still before the LORD
c66026	and wait patiently for Him;
c66027	fret not
c66028	when men prosper in their ways,
c66029	[when they]
c66030	carry out wicked schemes.
c66031	Refrain from anger
c66032	and abandon wrath;
c66033	do not fret— it can only
c66034	bring harm.
c66035	For the evildoers will be cut off,
c66036	but those who hope in the LORD
c66037	will inherit the land.
c66038	A little while,
c66039	and the wicked will be no more;
c66040	though you look for them,
c66041	they will not be found.
c66042	But the meek will inherit the land
c66043	and delight in abundant prosperity.
c66044	The wicked scheme against the righteous
c66045	and gnash their teeth at them,
c66046	but the Lord laughs,
c66047	seeing
c66048	that their day is coming.
c66049	The wicked have drawn the sword
c66050	and bent the bow
c66051	to bring down the poor and needy,
c66052	to slay those whose ways [are] upright.
c66053	[But] their swords will pierce their own hearts,
c66054	and their bows will be broken.
c66055	Better [is] the little of the righteous than the abundance of many wicked.
c66056	For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
c66057	but the LORD upholds the righteous.
c66058	The LORD knows the days of the blameless,
c66059	and their inheritance will last forever.
c66060	In the time of evil they will not be ashamed,
c66061	and in the days of famine they will be satisfied.
c66062	But the wicked ... will perish
c66063	and enemies of the LORD ... like the glory of the fields. They will vanish;
c66064	like smoke they will fade away.
c66065	The wicked borrow
c66066	and do not repay,
c66067	but the righteous are gracious
c66068	and giving.
c66069	Surely those He blesses will inherit the land,
c66070	but the cursed will be destroyed.
c66071	The steps of a man are ordered by the LORD,
c66072	and He delights in his way.
c66073	Though he falls,
c66074	he will not be overwhelmed,
c66075	for the LORD is holding his hand.
c66076	I once was young
c66077	and now am old,
c66078	yet never have I seen
c66079	the righteous abandoned
c66080	or their children begging for bread.
c66081	They are ever generous
c66082	and quick to lend,
c66083	and their children are a blessing.
c66084	Turn away from evil
c66085	and do good,
c66086	so that you will abide forever.
c66087	For the LORD loves justice
c66088	and will not forsake His saints.
c66089	They are preserved forever,
c66090	but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off.
c66091	The righteous will inherit the land
c66092	and dwell in it forever.
c66093	The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom,
c66094	and his tongue speaks justice.
c66095	The law of his God is in his heart;
c66096	his steps do not falter.
c66097	Though the wicked lie in wait for the righteous,
c66098	and seek
c66099	to slay them,
c66100	the LORD will not leave them in their power
c66101	or let them be condemned
c66102	under judgment.
c66103	Wait for the LORD
c66104	and keep His way,
c66105	and He will raise you up
c66106	to inherit the land.
c66107	When the wicked are cut off,
c66108	you will see [it].
c66109	I have seen a wicked,
c66110	ruthless man
c66111	flourishing like a well-rooted native tree,
c66112	yet he passed away
c66113	and was no more;
c66114	though I searched,
c66115	he could not be found.
c66116	Consider the blameless
c66117	and observe the upright,
c66118	for a posterity [awaits] the man of peace.
c66119	But the transgressors will all be destroyed;
c66120	the future of the wicked will be cut off.
c66121	The salvation of the righteous [is] from the LORD;
c66122	[He is] their stronghold in time of trouble.
c66123	The LORD helps
c66124	and delivers them;
c66125	He rescues ... from the wicked,
c66126	and saves them
c66127	because they take refuge in Him.
c66128	A Psalm of David,
c66129	for remembrance.
c66130	O LORD,
c66131	do not rebuke me in Your anger
c66132	or discipline me in Your wrath.
c66133	For Your arrows have pierced me deeply,
c66134	and Your hand has pressed down on me.
c66135	There is no soundness in my body because of Your anger;
c66136	there is no rest in my bones because of my sin.
c66137	For my iniquities have overwhelmed me;
c66138	they are a burden too heavy to bear.
c66139	are foul
c66140	My wounds ... and festering because of my sinful folly.
c66141	I am bent
c66142	and brought low;
c66143	all day long I go about mourning.
c66144	For my loins are full of burning pain,
c66145	and no soundness [remains] in my body.
c66146	I am numb
c66147	and badly crushed;
c66148	I groan in anguish of heart.
c66149	O Lord,
c66150	my every desire [is] before You;
c66151	my groaning is not hidden from You.
c66152	My heart pounds,
c66153	my strength fails,
c66154	the light of my eyes
c66155	and even ... has faded.
c66156	My beloved and friends shun my disease,
c66157	and my kinsmen stand at a distance.
c66158	lay snares;
c66159	Those who seek my life
c66161	those who wish me harm
c66162	speak destruction,
c66163	and plot deceit all day long.
c66164	But I, like a deaf man,
c66165	do not hear,
c66166	and like a mute man,
c66167	I do not open my mouth.
c66168	I have become like a man
c66169	who does not hear,
c66170	whose mouth offers no reply.
c66171	for You,
c66172	O LORD;
c66173	I wait
c66174	You will answer,
c66175	O Lord my God.
c66176	For I said,
c66177	“Let them not gloat over me—
c66178	when my foot slips.”
c66179	those who taunt me
c66180	For I am ready to fall,
c66181	and my pain is ever with me.
c66182	Yes, I confess my iniquity;
c66183	I am troubled by my sin.
c66184	Many are my enemies without cause,
c66186	and many
c66187	hate me without reason.
c66189	Those who repay my good with evil
c66190	attack
c66191	me for pursuing the good.
c66192	Do not forsake me,
c66193	O LORD; ... O my God.
c66194	be not far from me,
c66195	Come quickly to help me,
c66196	O Lord my Savior.
c66197	For the choirmaster. For Jeduthun.
c66198	A Psalm of David.
c66199	I said,
c66200	“I will watch my ways
c66201	so that I will not sin with my tongue;
c66202	I will guard my mouth with a muzzle
c66203	as long as the wicked are present.”
c66204	I was speechless and still;
c66205	I held my peace, [even] from good,
c66206	and my sorrow was stirred.
c66207	My heart grew hot within me;
c66208	as I mused, the fire burned.
c66209	[Then] I spoke with my tongue:
c66210	“Show me,
c66211	O LORD,
c66212	my end
c66213	and the measure of my days.
c66214	how
c66215	Let me know
c66216	fleeting my life is.
c66217	You, indeed, have made my days [as] handbreadths,
c66218	and my lifetime as nothing before You.
c66219	Truly each man at his best exists as but a breath.
c66220	Selah
c66221	Surely every man goes about like a phantom;
c66222	surely he bustles in vain;
c66223	he heaps up [riches]
c66224	not knowing
c66225	who will haul them away.
c66226	Now,
c66227	for what do I wait?
c66228	Lord,
c66229	My hope is
c66230	in You.
c66231	Deliver me from all my transgressions;
c66232	do not make me the reproach of fools.
c66233	I have become mute;
c66234	I do not open my mouth
c66235	because it is You who have done it.
c66236	Remove Your scourge from me;
c66237	I am perishing by the force of Your hand.
c66238	You discipline and correct a man for his iniquity,
c66239	consuming like a moth what he holds dear;
c66240	surely each man [is] but a vapor.
c66241	Selah
c66242	Hear my prayer,
c66243	O LORD,
c66244	and give ear to my cry for help;
c66245	do not be deaf to my weeping.
c66246	For I am a foreigner dwelling with You,
c66247	a sojourner like all my fathers.
c66248	Turn Your gaze away from me,
c66249	that I may again be cheered
c66250	before I depart
c66251	and am no more.”
c66252	For the choirmaster.
c66253	of David.
c66254	A Psalm
c66255	I waited patiently for the LORD;
c66256	He inclined to me
c66257	and heard my cry.
c66258	He lifted me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay;
c66259	He set my feet upon a rock,
c66260	[and] made my footsteps firm.
c66261	He put a new song in my mouth,
c66262	a hymn of praise to our God.
c66263	Many will see
c66264	and fear
c66265	and put their trust in the LORD.
c66266	Blessed is the man
c66267	who has made the LORD his trust,
c66268	who has not turned to the proud, nor to those who lapse into falsehood!
c66269	Many, ... You have done,
c66270	O LORD my God,
c66271	are the wonders ... and the plans You have for us—
c66272	none can compare to You—
c66273	if I would proclaim
c66274	and declare of them,
c66275	they are more
c66276	than could be numbered.
c66277	Sacrifice and offering You did not desire,
c66278	but my ears You have opened.
c66279	Burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not require.
c66280	Then I said,
c66281	“Here I am, I have come—
c66282	it is written about me in the scroll:
c66283	to do Your will,
c66284	O my God;
c66285	I delight
c66286	Your law [is] within my heart.”
c66287	I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly;
c66288	behold, I do not seal my lips,
c66289	O LORD.
c66290	as You know,
c66291	I have not covered up Your righteousness in my heart;
c66292	I have declared Your faithfulness and salvation;
c66293	I have not concealed Your loving devotion or truth from the great assembly.
c66295	O LORD,
c66296	do not withhold Your mercy from me;
c66297	Your loving devotion and truth will always guard me.
c66298	For evils without number surround me;
c66299	my sins have overtaken me,
c66300	so that I cannot
c66301	see.
c66302	They are more than the hairs of my head,
c66303	and my heart has failed within me.
c66304	Be pleased,
c66305	O LORD,
c66306	to deliver me;
c66307	O LORD,
c66308	hurry, ... to help me.
c66309	be ashamed
c66310	and confounded;
c66311	May those who seek my life
c66313	be repelled
c66314	may those who wish me harm ... and humiliated.
c66315	be appalled at their own shame.
c66316	May those who say to me,
c66317	“Aha, aha!”
c66318	rejoice
c66319	May all ... and be glad in You;
c66320	who seek You
c66321	always say,
c66322	“The LORD be magnified!”
c66323	may those who love Your salvation
c66324	But I [am] poor and needy;
c66325	may the Lord think of me.
c66326	You are my helper and deliverer;
c66327	O my God,
c66328	do not delay.
c66329	For the choirmaster.
c66330	A Psalm of David.
c66331	Blessed
c66332	[is] he who cares for the poor;
c66333	the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble.
c66334	The LORD will protect
c66335	and preserve him;
c66336	He will bless him in the land
c66337	and will not surrender him to the will of his foes.
c66338	The LORD will sustain him on his bed of illness
c66339	and restore him from his bed of sickness.
c66340	I said,
c66341	“O LORD,
c66342	be gracious to me;
c66343	heal me,
c66344	for I have sinned against You.”
c66345	My enemies say with malice:
c66346	“When will he die
c66347	and be forgotten?”
c66348	My visitor
c66350	speaks falsehood; ... in his heart;
c66351	he gathers slander
c66352	he goes out
c66353	and spreads it abroad.
c66354	All who hate ... whisper against me;
c66355	me ... they imagine the worst for me:
c66356	“A vile disease has been poured into him;
c66358	from where he lies!”
c66359	he will never
c66360	get up
c66361	Even my close friend,
c66362	whom I trusted,
c66363	he who shared my bread,
c66364	has lifted up [his] heel against me.
c66365	But You,
c66366	O LORD,
c66367	be gracious to me
c66368	and raise me up,
c66369	that I may repay them.
c66370	By this I know
c66371	You delight in me,
c66372	for my enemy does not triumph over me.
c66373	In my
c66374	integrity You uphold me
c66375	and set me in Your presence forever.
c66376	Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
c66377	Amen and Amen.
c66378	For the choirmaster.
c66379	A Maskil of the sons of Korah.
c66380	As the deer
c66381	pants for streams of water,
c66382	so my soul longs after You,
c66383	O God.
c66384	My soul thirsts for God, the living God.
c66385	When shall I come
c66386	and appear in God’s presence?
c66387	My tears have been my food day and night,
c66388	while men say to me all day long,
c66389	“Where is your God?”
c66390	These things come to mind
c66391	as I pour out my soul:
c66392	how I walked with the multitude,
c66393	leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and praise.
c66394	Why are you downcast,
c66395	O my soul?
c66396	Why the unease within me?
c66397	Put your hope in God,
c66398	for I shall yet praise Him for the salvation of His presence.
c66399	O my God,
c66400	my soul despairs within me.
c66401	Therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan and the peaks of Hermon— from Mount Mizar.
c66402	Deep calls to deep in the roar of Your waterfalls;
c66403	all Your breakers and waves have rolled over me.
c66404	The LORD decrees His loving devotion by day;
c66405	and at night His song is with me—
c66406	a prayer to the God of my life.
c66407	I will say to God,
c66408	my rock,
c66409	“Why have You forgotten me?
c66410	Why must I walk in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression?”
c66411	Like the crushing of my bones, my enemies taunt me,
c66412	while they say to me all day long,
c66413	“Where is your God?”
c66414	Why are you downcast,
c66415	O my soul?
c66416	Why the unease within me?
c66417	Put your hope in God,
c66418	for I shall yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.
c66419	Vindicate me,
c66420	O God,
c66421	and plead my case against an ungodly nation;
c66422	deliver me from deceitful and unjust men.
c66423	For You are the God of my refuge.
c66424	Why have You rejected me?
c66425	Why must I walk in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression?
c66426	Send out Your light and Your truth;
c66427	let them lead me.
c66428	Let them bring me to Your holy mountain, and to the place where You dwell.
c66429	Then I will go to the altar of God,
c66430	to God, my greatest joy.
c66431	I will praise You with the harp,
c66432	O God, my God.
c66433	Why are you downcast,
c66434	O my soul?
c66435	Why the unease within me?
c66436	Put your hope in God,
c66437	for I shall yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.
c66438	For the choirmaster.
c66439	of the sons of Korah.
c66440	A Maskil
c66441	O God;
c66442	We have heard with our ears,
c66443	our fathers have told us the work
c66444	You did in their days, in days of long ago.
c66445	With Your hand You drove out the nations
c66446	and planted [our fathers] there;
c66447	You crushed the peoples
c66448	and cast them out.
c66449	For it was not by their sword that they took the land;
c66450	their arm did not bring them victory;
c66451	it was by Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face;
c66452	for You delighted in them.
c66453	You are my King,
c66454	O God,
c66455	who ordains victories for Jacob.
c66456	Through You we repel our foes;
c66457	through Your name we trample
c66458	our enemies.
c66459	For I do not trust in my bow,
c66460	nor does my sword deliver me.
c66461	But You give us victory over our enemies;
c66462	You put those who hate us to shame.
c66463	In God we have boasted all day long,
c66464	and Your name we will praise forever.
c66465	Selah
c66466	But You have rejected
c66467	and humbled us;
c66468	You no longer go forth with our armies.
c66469	You have made us retreat from the foe,
c66470	and those who hate us have plundered us.
c66471	You have given us up as sheep to be devoured;
c66472	You have scattered us among the nations.
c66473	You sell Your people for nothing; ... profit
c66474	no ... do You gain from their sale.
c66475	You have made us a reproach to our neighbors,
c66476	a mockery and derision to those around us.
c66477	You have made us a byword among the nations,
c66478	a laughingstock
c66479	among the peoples.
c66480	All day long my disgrace is before me
c66481	and shame has covered my face,
c66482	at the voice of the scorner and reviler,
c66483	because of the enemy, bent on revenge.
c66484	All this has come upon us,
c66485	though we have not forgotten You
c66486	or betrayed Your covenant.
c66487	Our hearts have not turned back;
c66488	our steps have not strayed from Your path.
c66489	But You have crushed us in the lair of jackals;
c66490	You have covered us with deepest darkness.
c66491	If we had forgotten the name of our God
c66492	or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
c66493	would not God have discovered,
c66494	since He knows the secrets of the heart?
c66495	Yet for Your sake we face death all day long;
c66496	we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
c66497	Wake up,
c66498	Why are You sleeping?
c66499	O Lord!
c66500	Arise!
c66501	Do not reject us forever.
c66502	Why do You hide Your face
c66503	and forget our misery and oppression?
c66504	For our soul has sunk to the dust;
c66505	our bodies cling to the earth.
c66506	Rise up, be our help!
c66507	Redeem us on account of Your loving devotion.
c66508	For the choirmaster.
c66509	To the tune of “The Lilies.”
c66510	of the sons of Korah.
c66511	A Maskil
c66512	A love song.
c66513	My heart is stirred by a noble theme
c66514	as I recite my verses to the king;
c66515	my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
c66516	You are the most handsome of men;
c66517	grace has anointed your lips,
c66518	since God has blessed you forever.
c66519	Strap your sword at your side,
c66520	O mighty warrior;
c66521	appear in your majesty and splendor.
c66522	In your splendor ... in victory
c66523	ride forth ... on behalf of truth and humility and justice;
c66524	may your right hand show your awesome deeds.
c66525	Your arrows pierce
c66526	the nations fall beneath your feet.
c66527	the hearts of the king’s foes;
c66528	Your throne,
c66529	O God,
c66530	[endures] forever and ever,
c66531	[and] justice [is] the scepter of Your kingdom.
c66532	You have loved righteousness
c66533	and hated wickedness;
c66534	therefore God, your God, [has placed you above] your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.
c66535	All your garments [are fragrant with] myrrh and aloes and cassia;
c66536	from palaces of ivory the harps make you glad.
c66537	The daughters of kings are among your honored women;
c66538	the queen stands at your right hand, adorned with the gold of Ophir.
c66539	Listen,
c66540	O daughter,
c66541	observe
c66542	and incline your ear:
c66543	Forget your people and your father’s house,
c66544	and the king will desire your beauty;
c66545	for he is your lord.
c66546	bow to him,
c66547	The daughter of Tyre
c66548	[will come] with a gift; men of wealth will seek your favor.
c66549	All glorious is the princess in her chamber,
c66550	her gown embroidered with gold.
c66551	In colorful garments she is led to the king;
c66552	her virgin
c66553	companions are brought before you.
c66554	They are led in with joy and gladness;
c66555	they enter the palace of the king.
c66556	Your sons will succeed your fathers;
c66557	you will make them princes throughout the land.
c66558	I will commemorate your name through all generations;
c66559	therefore the nations will praise you forever and ever.
c66560	For the choirmaster.
c66561	Of the sons of Korah.
c66562	According to Alamoth.
c66563	A Song.
c66564	God is our refuge and strength,
c66565	an ever-present help in times of trouble.
c66566	Therefore we will not fear,
c66567	though the earth is transformed
c66568	and the mountains are toppled into the depths of the seas,
c66569	roar
c66570	though its waters ... and foam
c66571	and the mountains quake in the surge.
c66572	Selah
c66573	There is a river
c66574	whose streams delight the city of God, the holy [place where] the Most High dwells.
c66575	God is within her;
c66576	she will not be moved.
c66577	God will help her
c66578	when morning dawns.
c66579	Nations rage,
c66580	kingdoms crumble;
c66581	when He lifts His voice.
c66582	the earth melts
c66583	The LORD of Hosts is with us;
c66584	the God of Jacob is our fortress.
c66585	Selah
c66586	Come,
c66587	see the works of the LORD,
c66588	who brings devastation upon the earth.
c66589	He makes wars to cease throughout the earth;
c66590	He breaks the bow
c66591	and shatters the spear;
c66592	He burns the shields in the fire.
c66593	“Be still
c66594	and know
c66595	that I am God;
c66596	I will be exalted among the nations,
c66597	I will be exalted over the earth.”
c66598	The LORD of Hosts is with us;
c66599	the God of Jacob is our fortress.
c66600	Selah
c66601	For the choirmaster.
c66602	of the sons of Korah.
c66603	A Psalm
c66604	all you peoples;
c66605	Clap your hands,
c66606	shout unto God with a voice of triumph.
c66607	How awesome [is] the LORD the Most High,
c66608	the great King over all the earth!
c66609	He subdues nations beneath us,
c66610	and peoples under our feet.
c66611	He chooses our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob,
c66612	whom He loves.
c66613	Selah
c66614	God has ascended amid shouts of joy,
c66615	the LORD with the sound of trumpets.
c66616	Sing praises to God,
c66617	sing praises;
c66618	sing praises to our King,
c66619	sing praises!
c66620	For God is King of all the earth;
c66621	sing profound praises to Him.
c66622	God reigns over the nations;
c66623	God is seated on His holy throne.
c66624	The nobles of the nations have assembled as the people of the God of Abraham;
c66625	for the shields of the earth belong to God;
c66626	He is highly exalted.
c66627	A Song.
c66628	A Psalm
c66629	of the sons of Korah.
c66630	Great is the LORD,
c66631	and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, His holy mountain.
c66632	Beautiful in loftiness,
c66633	the joy of all the earth, like the peaks of Zaphron [is] Mount Zion, the city of the great King.
c66634	God is in her citadels; He has shown Himself a fortress.
c66635	For behold, the kings assembled;
c66636	they all advanced together.
c66637	They saw
c66638	and were astounded;
c66639	in terror.
c66640	they fled
c66641	Trembling seized them there,
c66642	anguish like a woman in labor.
c66643	With a wind from the east You wrecked the ships of Tarshish.
c66644	As we have heard,
c66645	so we have seen in the city of the LORD of Hosts, in the city of our God:
c66646	God will establish her forever.
c66647	Selah
c66648	we contemplate
c66649	O God,
c66650	Within Your temple, ... Your loving devotion.
c66651	Your name,
c66652	O God,
c66653	like Your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth;
c66654	Your right hand is full of righteousness.
c66655	Mount Zion is glad,
c66656	the towns of Judah rejoice, on account of Your judgments.
c66657	March around Zion,
c66658	encircle her,
c66659	count her towers,
c66660	consider her ramparts,
c66661	tour her citadels,
c66662	that you may tell the next generation.
c66663	For this God [is] our God forever and ever;
c66664	He will be our guide
c66665	even until death.
c66666	For the choirmaster.
c66667	of the sons of Korah.
c66668	A Psalm
c66669	Hear this,
c66670	all you peoples;
c66671	listen,
c66672	all inhabitants of the world,
c66673	both low and high,
c66675	rich and poor alike.
c66676	My mouth will impart wisdom,
c66677	and the meditation of my heart will bring understanding.
c66678	I will incline my ear to a proverb;
c66679	I will express my riddle with the harp:
c66680	Why should I fear in times of trouble,
c66681	when wicked usurpers surround me?
c66682	They trust in their wealth
c66683	and boast in great riches.
c66684	No man can possibly redeem his brother
c66685	or pay his ransom to God.
c66686	For the redemption of his soul is costly,
c66687	and never can payment suffice,
c66688	that he should live on forever
c66689	and not see decay.
c66690	For it is clear
c66691	that wise men die,
c66692	and the foolish and the senseless both perish
c66693	and leave their wealth to others.
c66694	Their graves
c66695	are their eternal homes—
c66696	their dwellings for endless generations—
c66697	even though [their] lands were their namesakes.
c66698	But a man, despite his wealth, cannot endure;
c66699	he is like the beasts
c66700	that perish.
c66701	This is the fate
c66702	of the self-confident
c66703	and their followers who endorse their sayings.
c66704	Selah
c66705	Like sheep they are destined for Sheol.
c66706	Death will be their shepherd.
c66707	The upright will rule them in the morning,
c66708	and their form
c66709	will decay in Sheol, far from their lofty abode.
c66710	But God will redeem my life from Sheol,
c66711	for He will surely take me to Himself.
c66712	Selah
c66713	Do not be amazed
c66714	when a man grows rich,
c66715	when the splendor of his house increases.
c66716	For when he dies, he will carry nothing away;
c66717	his abundance will not follow him down.
c66718	Though in his lifetime he blesses his soul—
c66719	and men praise
c66720	you when you prosper—
c66721	he will join the generation of his fathers,
c66722	who will never see the light of day.
c66723	A man who has riches
c66724	without understanding
c66725	is like the beasts
c66726	that perish.
c66727	A Psalm of Asaph.
c66728	The Mighty One, God the LORD, speaks
c66729	and summons the earth from the rising to the setting of the sun.
c66730	From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.
c66731	Our God comes
c66732	and will not be silent!
c66733	Consuming fire precedes Him,
c66734	and a tempest rages around Him.
c66735	He summons the heavens above, and the earth,
c66736	that He may judge His people:
c66737	“Gather to Me My saints,
c66738	who made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.”
c66739	And the heavens proclaim His righteousness,
c66740	for God
c66741	Himself is Judge.
c66742	Selah
c66743	“Hear,
c66744	O My people,
c66745	and I will speak,
c66746	O Israel,
c66747	and I will testify against you:
c66748	I am God, your God.
c66749	I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices,
c66750	and your burnt offerings are ever before Me.
c66751	I have no need for a bull from your stall
c66752	or goats from your pens,
c66753	for every beast of the forest is Mine—
c66754	the cattle on a thousand hills.
c66755	I know every bird in the mountains,
c66756	and the creatures of the field [are] Mine.
c66757	If I were hungry,
c66758	I would not tell you,
c66759	for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof.
c66760	Do I eat the flesh of bulls,
c66761	or drink the blood of goats?
c66762	Sacrifice a thank offering to God,
c66763	and fulfill your vows to the Most High.
c66764	Call upon Me in the day of trouble;
c66765	I will deliver you,
c66766	and you will honor Me.”
c66767	To the wicked, however, God says,
c66768	“What right have you
c66769	to recite My statutes
c66770	and to bear My covenant on your lips?
c66771	For you hate My instruction
c66772	and cast My words behind you.
c66773	When you see a thief,
c66774	you befriend him,
c66775	and throw in your lot with adulterers.
c66776	You unleash your mouth for evil
c66777	and unharness your tongue for deceit.
c66778	You sit
c66779	and malign your brother,
c66780	you slander your own mother’s son.
c66781	You have done these things,
c66782	and I kept silent;
c66783	you thought
c66784	I was just like you.
c66785	But I Myself will rebuke you
c66786	and accuse you to your face.
c66787	Now consider this,
c66788	you who forget God,
c66789	lest I tear you to pieces,
c66790	with no one to rescue you:
c66791	He who sacrifices a thank offering
c66792	honors Me,
c66793	and to him who rights [his] way,
c66794	I will show the salvation of God.”
c66795	For the choirmaster.
c66796	A Psalm of David.
c66797	When Nathan the prophet came to him
c66798	after his adultery with Bathsheba.
c66799	Have mercy on me,
c66800	O God,
c66801	according to Your loving devotion;
c66802	according to Your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.
c66803	Wash me clean
c66804	of my iniquity
c66805	and cleanse me from my sin.
c66806	For I know my transgressions,
c66807	and my sin is always before me.
c66808	Against You, You only, have I sinned
c66810	what is evil in Your sight,
c66811	and done
c66812	so that You may be found just
c66813	when You speak
c66814	and blameless
c66815	when You judge.
c66816	Surely I was brought forth in iniquity;
c66817	I was sinful when my mother conceived me.
c66818	Surely You desire truth in the inmost being;
c66819	You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
c66820	Purify me with hyssop,
c66821	and I will be clean;
c66822	wash me,
c66823	and I will be whiter than snow.
c66824	Let me hear joy and gladness;
c66825	let the bones ... rejoice.
c66826	You have crushed
c66827	Hide Your face from my sins
c66828	and blot out all my iniquities.
c66829	Create in me a clean heart,
c66830	O God,
c66831	and renew a right spirit within me.
c66832	Cast me not away from Your presence;
c66833	take not Your Holy Spirit from me.
c66834	Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,
c66835	and sustain me with a willing spirit.
c66836	Then I will teach transgressors Your ways,
c66837	and sinners will return to You.
c66838	Deliver me from bloodguilt,
c66839	O God, the God of my salvation,
c66840	and my tongue will sing of Your righteousness.
c66841	O Lord,
c66842	open my lips,
c66843	and my mouth will declare Your praise.
c66844	For You do not delight in sacrifice,
c66845	or I would bring it;
c66846	You take no pleasure in burnt offerings.
c66847	The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit;
c66848	a broken and a contrite heart,
c66849	O God,
c66850	You will not despise.
c66851	In Your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper;
c66852	build up the walls of Jerusalem.
c66853	Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, in whole burnt offerings;
c66854	then bulls will be offered on Your altar.
c66855	For the choirmaster.
c66856	A Maskil of David.
c66857	After Doeg the Edomite went
c66858	to Saul and told
c66859	him,
c66860	“David has gone to the house of Ahimelech.”
c66861	Why do you boast of evil,
c66862	O mighty man?
c66863	The loving devotion of God [endures] all day long.
c66864	devises destruction
c66865	Your tongue ... like a sharpened razor,
c66866	O worker of deceit.
c66867	You love evil more than good,
c66868	falsehood
c66869	more than speaking the truth.
c66870	Selah
c66871	You love every word that devours,
c66872	O deceitful tongue.
c66873	Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin;
c66874	He will snatch you up
c66875	and tear you away from [your] tent;
c66876	He will uproot you from the land of the living.
c66877	Selah
c66878	The righteous will see
c66879	and fear;
c66880	they will mock [the evildoer], saying,
c66881	“Look at the man
c66882	who did not make God his refuge,
c66883	but trusted in the abundance of his wealth,
c66884	who strengthened himself by bringing destruction.”
c66885	But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God;
c66886	I trust in the loving devotion of God forever and ever.
c66887	I will praise You forever,
c66888	because You have done it.
c66889	I will wait on Your name—
c66890	for it is good— in the presence of Your saints.
c66891	For the choirmaster.
c66892	According to Mahalath.
c66893	A Maskil of David.
c66894	The fool says in his heart,
c66895	“[There is] no God.”
c66896	They are corrupt;
c66897	their ways are vile.
c66898	There is no one who does good.
c66899	God looks down from heaven upon the sons of men
c66900	to see
c66901	if any understand,
c66902	if any seek God.
c66903	All have turned away,
c66904	they have together become corrupt;
c66905	there is no one who does good,
c66906	not even one.
c66907	Will the workers of iniquity never learn?
c66908	They devour my people [like] bread;
c66909	they refuse to call upon the LORD.
c66910	There they are, overwhelmed with dread,
c66911	[where] there was nothing to fear.
c66912	For God has scattered the bones of those who besieged you.
c66913	You will put them to shame,
c66914	for God has despised them.
c66915	Oh, that ... would come
c66916	the salvation of Israel ... from Zion!
c66917	When God restores His Captive people,
c66918	let Jacob rejoice,
c66919	let Israel be glad!
c66920	For the choirmaster.
c66921	With stringed instruments.
c66922	A Maskil of David.
c66923	When the Ziphites went
c66924	to Saul and said,
c66925	“Is David not hiding among us?”
c66926	O God,
c66927	Save me, ... by Your name,
c66928	and vindicate me by Your might!
c66929	O God;
c66930	Hear my prayer,
c66931	listen to the words of my mouth.
c66932	For strangers rise up against me,
c66933	and ruthless men seek my life—
c66934	men with no regard for God.
c66935	Selah
c66936	Surely God is my helper;
c66937	the Lord is the sustainer of my soul.
c66938	He will reward my enemies with evil.
c66939	In Your faithfulness, destroy them.
c66940	Freely I will sacrifice to You;
c66941	I will praise Your name,
c66942	O LORD,
c66943	for it is good.
c66944	For He has delivered me from every trouble,
c66945	and my eyes have stared down my foes.
c66946	For the choirmaster.
c66947	With stringed instruments.
c66948	A Maskil of David.
c66949	Listen
c66950	O God,
c66951	to my prayer,
c66952	and do not ignore my plea.
c66953	Attend to me
c66954	and answer me.
c66955	I am restless in my complaint,
c66956	and distraught
c66957	at the voice of the enemy,
c66958	at the pressure of the wicked.
c66959	For they release disaster upon me
c66960	and revile me in their anger.
c66961	My heart murmurs within me,
c66962	and the terrors of death assail me.
c66963	Fear and trembling grip me,
c66964	and horror has overwhelmed me.
c66965	I said,
c66966	“Oh, that
c66967	I had wings like a dove!
c66968	I would fly away
c66969	and find rest.
c66970	How far away
c66971	I would flee;
c66972	in the wilderness I would remain.
c66973	Selah
c66974	I would hurry to my shelter far from this raging
c66975	tempest.”
c66976	confuse
c66977	O Lord,
c66978	and confound their speech,
c66979	for I see violence and strife in the city.
c66980	Day and night they encircle the walls,
c66981	while malice and trouble [lie] within.
c66982	Destruction [is] in the midst;
c66983	oppression and deceit never leave the streets.
c66984	For it is not an enemy who insults me—
c66985	then I could endure;
c66986	it is not a foe who rises against me—
c66987	from him I could hide.
c66988	But it is you, a man like myself, my companion and close friend.
c66989	We shared sweet fellowship together;
c66990	we walked with the crowd into the house of God.
c66991	Let death seize them by surprise;
c66992	let them go down to Sheol alive,
c66993	for evil is with them in their homes.
c66994	But I call to God,
c66995	and the LORD will save me.
c66996	Morning, noon, and night, ... in distress,
c66997	I cry out
c66998	and He will hear my voice.
c66999	He will redeem my soul in peace from the battle;
c67000	though many are against me,
c67001	God will hear
c67002	and humiliate them—
c67003	the One enthroned for the ages—
c67004	Selah
c67005	because they do not change
c67006	and they have no fear of God.
c67007	My companion attacks his friends;
c67008	he violates his covenant.
c67009	His speech is smooth as butter,
c67010	but war is in his heart.
c67011	His words are softer than oil,
c67012	yet they are swords unsheathed.
c67013	Cast your burden upon the LORD
c67014	and He will sustain you;
c67015	He will never let the righteous be shaken.
c67016	But You,
c67017	O God,
c67018	will bring them down to the Pit of destruction;
c67019	men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days.
c67020	But I will trust in You.
c67021	For the choirmaster.
c67022	To the tune of “A Dove on Distant Oaks.”
c67023	of David,
c67024	A Miktam
c67025	when the Philistines seized him in Gath.
c67026	Be merciful to me,
c67027	O God,
c67028	for men are hounding me;
c67029	all day long they press their attack.
c67030	My enemies pursue me all day long,
c67031	for many proudly assail me.
c67032	When
c67033	I am afraid,
c67034	I will trust in You.
c67035	In God, whose word I praise,
c67036	in God I trust;
c67037	I will not be afraid.
c67038	What can man do to me?
c67039	All day long they twist my words;
c67040	all their thoughts [are] of my demise.
c67041	They conspire,
c67042	they lurk,
c67043	they watch my steps,
c67044	while they wait to take my life.
c67045	In spite of such sin, {shall} they escape?
c67046	In Your anger, ... cast down the nations.
c67047	O God,
c67048	You have taken account of my wanderings;
c67049	You have put my tears in Your bottle.
c67050	Are they not in Your book?
c67051	Then my enemies will retreat on the day
c67052	I cry for help.
c67053	By this I will know
c67054	that God [is] on my side.
c67055	In God, whose word I praise,
c67056	in the LORD, whose word I praise,
c67057	in God I trust;
c67058	I will not be afraid.
c67059	What can man do to me?
c67060	[are] upon me,
c67061	O God;
c67062	Your vows
c67063	I will render thank offerings to You.
c67064	For You have delivered my soul from death,
c67065	and my feet from stumbling,
c67066	that I may walk before God in the light of life.
c67067	For the choirmaster. [To the tune of]
c67068	“Do Not Destroy.”
c67069	of David,
c67070	A Miktam
c67071	when he fled from Saul into the cave.
c67072	Have mercy on me,
c67073	O God,
c67074	have mercy,
c67075	for in You my soul takes refuge.
c67076	In the shadow of Your wings I will take shelter
c67077	until the danger has passed.
c67078	I cry out to God Most High,
c67079	to God
c67080	who fulfills His purpose for me.
c67081	He reaches down from heaven
c67082	and saves me;
c67083	He rebukes those who trample me.
c67084	Selah
c67085	God sends forth His loving devotion and His truth.
c67086	My soul [is] among the lions;
c67087	I lie down with ravenous beasts
c67089	whose teeth are spears and arrows,
c67090	whose tongues are sharp swords.
c67091	Be exalted, ... above the heavens;
c67092	O God,
c67093	may Your glory cover all the earth.
c67094	They spread a net for my feet;
c67095	my soul was despondent.
c67096	They dug a pit before me,
c67097	but they themselves have fallen into it!
c67098	Selah
c67099	My heart is steadfast,
c67100	O God,
c67101	my heart is steadfast.
c67102	I will sing
c67103	and make music.
c67104	Awake,
c67105	O glory!
c67106	Awake,
c67107	O harp and lyre!
c67108	I will awaken the dawn.
c67109	I will praise You, ... among the nations;
c67110	O Lord,
c67111	I will sing Your praises
c67112	among the peoples.
c67113	For Your loving devotion reaches to the heavens,
c67114	Your faithfulness to the clouds.
c67115	Be exalted, ... above the heavens;
c67116	O God,
c67117	may Your glory cover all the earth.
c67118	For the choirmaster. To the tune of
c67119	“Do Not Destroy.”
c67120	of David.
c67121	A Miktam
c67122	Do you indeed speak justly, O rulers?
c67123	Do you judge uprightly,
c67124	O sons of men?
c67125	No, in your hearts you devise injustice;
c67126	with your hands you mete out violence on the earth.
c67127	The wicked are estranged from the womb;
c67128	the liars go astray from birth.
c67129	Their venom [is] like the poison of a serpent,
c67130	like a cobra that shuts
c67131	its ears,
c67132	that it need not heed the tune of the charmer ... weaves his spell.
c67133	who skillfully
c67134	O God,
c67135	shatter their teeth in their mouths;
c67136	tear out the fangs of the lions.
c67137	O LORD,
c67138	May they vanish like water
c67139	that runs off;
c67140	when they draw the bow, may their arrows
c67141	be blunted.
c67142	Like a slug that dissolves in its slime,
c67143	like a woman’s stillborn child,
c67144	may they never see the sun.
c67145	Before your pots can feel [the heat of] thorns—
c67146	whether green or dry— He will sweep them away.
c67147	The righteous will rejoice
c67148	when they see they are avenged;
c67149	they will wash their feet in the blood of the wicked.
c67150	Then men will say,
c67151	“There is surely a reward for the righteous!
c67152	There is surely a God who judges the earth!”
c67153	For the choirmaster. To the tune of
c67154	“Do Not Destroy.”
c67155	of David,
c67156	A Miktam
c67157	when Saul sent
c67158	men to watch [his] house
c67159	to kill him.
c67160	Deliver me from my enemies,
c67161	O my God;
c67162	protect me from those who rise against me.
c67163	Deliver me from workers of iniquity,
c67164	and save me from men of bloodshed.
c67165	See how they lie in wait for me.
c67166	Fierce men conspire against me for no transgression [or] sin [of my own],
c67167	O LORD.
c67168	For no fault of my own, they move swiftly
c67169	to attack me.
c67170	Arise
c67171	to help me,
c67172	and take notice.
c67173	O LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, rise up
c67174	to punish all the nations;
c67175	show no mercy to the wicked traitors.
c67176	Selah
c67177	They return in the evening,
c67178	snarling like dogs
c67179	and prowling around the city.
c67180	See what they spew from their mouths—
c67181	sharp words from their lips:
c67182	“For who can hear us?”
c67183	But You,
c67184	O LORD,
c67185	laugh at them;
c67186	You scoff at all the nations.
c67187	I will keep watch for You, O my strength;
c67188	for You, O God, are my fortress.
c67189	My God of loving devotion will come to meet me;
c67190	God will let me stare down my foes.
c67191	Do not kill them,
c67192	or my people will forget.
c67193	Scatter them by Your power,
c67194	and bring them down,
c67195	O Lord, our shield.
c67196	By the sins of their mouths and the words of their lips,
c67197	let them be trapped in their pride,
c67198	in the curses and lies
c67199	they utter.
c67200	Consume [them] in wrath;
c67201	consume
c67202	them till they are no more,
c67203	so it may be known
c67204	to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob.
c67205	Selah
c67206	They return in the evening,
c67207	snarling like dogs
c67208	and prowling around the city.
c67209	They scavenge
c67210	for food,
c67211	if they are not satisfied.
c67212	and growl
c67213	But I will sing of Your strength
c67214	and proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning.
c67215	For You are my fortress,
c67216	my refuge in times
c67217	of trouble.
c67218	O my strength,
c67219	To You, ... I sing praises,
c67220	for You, O God, are my fortress,
c67221	my God of loving devotion.
c67222	For the choirmaster.
c67223	To the tune of “The Lily of Testimony.”
c67224	A Miktam of David
c67225	for instruction.
c67226	When he fought Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah,
c67227	and Joab returned
c67228	and struck down 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
c67229	O God;
c67230	You have rejected us,
c67231	You have broken us;
c67232	You have been angry;
c67233	restore us!
c67234	You have shaken the land
c67235	and torn it open.
c67236	Heal its fractures,
c67237	for it is quaking.
c67238	You have shown Your people hardship;
c67239	we are staggered from the wine You made us drink.
c67240	You have raised a banner for those who fear You,
c67241	that they may flee the bow.
c67242	Selah
c67243	that those You love may be delivered.
c67244	Save us with Your right hand;
c67245	answer us,
c67246	God has spoken from His sanctuary:
c67247	“I will triumph!
c67248	I will parcel out Shechem
c67249	and apportion the Valley of Succoth.
c67250	Gilead is Mine,
c67251	and Manasseh is Mine;
c67252	Ephraim is My helmet
c67253	[and] Judah is My scepter.
c67254	Moab is My washbasin;
c67255	upon Edom I toss My sandal;
c67256	over
c67257	Philistia
c67258	I shout in triumph.”
c67259	Who will bring me to the fortified city?
c67260	Who will lead me to Edom?
c67261	Have You not
c67262	O God?
c67263	rejected us,
c67264	Will You not march out
c67266	with our armies?
c67267	Give us aid against the enemy,
c67268	for the help of man is worthless.
c67269	With God we will perform with valor;
c67270	He will trample our enemies.
c67271	For the choirmaster.
c67272	With stringed instruments.
c67273	Of David.
c67274	Hear
c67275	O God,
c67276	my cry,
c67277	attend to my prayer.
c67278	From the ends of the earth I call out to You
c67279	whenever my heart is faint.
c67280	to the rock
c67281	[that] is higher than I.
c67282	Lead me
c67283	For You have been my refuge,
c67284	a tower of strength against the enemy.
c67285	Let me dwell in Your tent forever
c67286	and take refuge in the shelter of Your wings.
c67287	Selah
c67288	For You
c67289	O God;
c67290	have heard my vows,
c67291	You have given me the inheritance reserved for those who fear Your name.
c67292	Increase the days of the king’s life;
c67293	may his years span many generations.
c67294	May he sit enthroned in God’s presence forever;
c67295	appoint Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness
c67296	to guard him.
c67297	Then I will ever sing praise to Your name,
c67298	fulfilling my vows day by day.
c67299	For the choirmaster.
c67300	According to Jeduthun.
c67301	A Psalm of David.
c67302	In God alone my soul finds rest;
c67303	my salvation comes from Him.
c67304	He alone is my rock and my salvation;
c67305	[He is] my fortress,
c67306	I will never be shaken.
c67307	How long will you threaten a man?
c67308	Will all of you throw him down like a leaning wall
c67309	fence?
c67310	or a tottering
c67311	They fully intend ... from his lofty perch;
c67312	to topple him
c67313	they delight in lies;
c67314	with their mouths they bless,
c67315	but inwardly they curse.
c67316	Selah
c67317	Rest in God alone,
c67318	O my soul,
c67319	for my hope comes from Him.
c67320	He alone is my rock and my salvation;
c67321	[He is] my fortress,
c67322	I will not be shaken.
c67323	My salvation and my honor rest on God,
c67324	my strong rock; my refuge is in God.
c67325	Trust in Him at all times,
c67326	O people;
c67327	pour out your hearts before Him.
c67328	God is our refuge.
c67329	Selah
c67330	Lowborn men [are] but a vapor;
c67331	the exalted but a lie.
c67332	Weighed on the scale,
c67333	are pushed up;
c67334	they ... together they are but a breath.
c67335	Place no trust in extortion,
c67336	or false hope in stolen goods.
c67337	your riches
c67338	If ... increase,
c67339	do not set your heart [upon them].
c67340	God has spoken once;
c67341	twice:
c67342	I have heard this
c67343	that power belongs to God,
c67345	O Lord.
c67346	and loving devotion to You,
c67347	For You will repay each man according to his deeds.
c67348	A Psalm of David,
c67349	when he was in the Wilderness of Judah.
c67350	O God,
c67351	You are my God, ... You;
c67352	earnestly I seek
c67353	my soul thirsts for You;
c67354	my body yearns for You in a dry and weary land without water.
c67355	So I have seen You in the sanctuary,
c67356	to behold Your power and glory.
c67357	Because Your loving devotion is better than life,
c67358	my lips will glorify You.
c67359	So I will bless You as long as I live;
c67360	in Your name I will lift my hands.
c67361	My soul is satisfied as with the richest of foods;
c67362	with joyful lips my mouth will praise You.
c67363	When I remember You on my bed,
c67364	I think of You through the watches of the night.
c67365	For You are my help;
c67366	I will sing for joy in the shadow of Your wings.
c67367	My soul clings to You;
c67368	Your right hand upholds me.
c67369	But those who seek my life to destroy it
c67370	will go into the depths of the earth.
c67371	They will fall to the power of the sword;
c67372	they will become the portion of jackals.
c67373	But the king will rejoice in God;
c67374	all ... will exult,
c67375	who swear by Him
c67376	for the mouths of liars will be shut.
c67377	For the choirmaster.
c67378	A Psalm of David.
c67379	Hear,
c67380	O God,
c67381	my voice of complaint;
c67382	preserve my life from dread of the enemy.
c67383	Hide me from the scheming of the wicked,
c67384	from the mob of workers of iniquity,
c67385	who sharpen their tongues like swords
c67386	and aim their bitter words like arrows,
c67387	ambushing the innocent in seclusion,
c67388	shooting suddenly,
c67389	without fear.
c67390	They hold fast to their evil purpose;
c67391	they speak
c67392	of hiding their snares.
c67393	they say.
c67394	“Who will see them?”
c67395	They devise injustice [and say],
c67396	“We have perfected a secret plan.”
c67397	For the inner man and the heart are mysterious.
c67398	But God will shoot them with arrows;
c67399	suddenly they will be wounded.
c67400	They will be made to stumble,
c67401	their own tongues turned against them.
c67402	All ... will shake their heads.
c67403	who see
c67404	Then all mankind will fear
c67405	and proclaim the work of God;
c67406	so they will ponder what He has done.
c67407	Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD
c67408	and take refuge in Him;
c67409	let all the upright in heart exult.
c67410	For the choirmaster.
c67411	A Psalm of David.
c67412	A Song.
c67413	Praise awaits You,
c67414	O God,
c67415	in Zion; to You
c67416	our vows will be fulfilled.
c67417	O You who listen to prayer,
c67418	all men will come to You.
c67419	When iniquities prevail against me,
c67420	our transgressions.
c67421	You alone atone for
c67422	Blessed
c67423	is the one You choose
c67424	and bring near
c67425	to dwell in Your courts!
c67426	We are filled with the goodness of Your house, the holiness of Your temple.
c67427	With awesome deeds of righteousness You answer us,
c67428	O God of our salvation,
c67429	the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas.
c67430	You formed the mountains by Your power,
c67431	having girded Yourself with might.
c67432	You stilled the roaring of the seas, the pounding of their waves, and the tumult of the nations.
c67433	Those who live far away fear Your wonders;
c67434	You make the dawn and sunset shout for joy.
c67435	You attend to the earth
c67436	and water it;
c67437	with abundance You enrich it.
c67438	The streams of God are full of water,
c67439	You prepare our grain
c67440	for ... by providing for [the earth].
c67441	You soak its furrows
c67442	and level its ridges;
c67443	You soften it with showers
c67444	and bless its growth,
c67445	You crown the year with Your bounty,
c67446	and Your paths overflow with plenty.
c67447	The pastures of the wilderness overflow;
c67448	the hills are robed with joy.
c67449	The pastures are clothed with flocks,
c67450	and the valleys are decked with grain.
c67451	They shout in triumph;
c67452	indeed, they sing.
c67453	For the choirmaster.
c67454	A Song. A Psalm.
c67455	Make a joyful noise to God,
c67456	all the earth!
c67457	Sing the glory of His name;
c67458	make His praise glorious.
c67459	Say to God,
c67460	“How awesome are Your deeds!
c67461	So great is Your power that Your enemies cower before You.
c67462	All the earth bows down to You;
c67463	they sing praise to You;
c67464	they sing praise to Your name.”
c67465	Selah
c67466	Come
c67467	and see the works of God;
c67468	how awesome are His deeds toward mankind.
c67469	He turned the sea into dry land;
c67470	they passed through the waters on foot;
c67471	there we rejoiced in Him.
c67472	He rules forever by His power;
c67473	His eyes watch the nations.
c67474	Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves.
c67475	Selah
c67476	Praise
c67477	O peoples;
c67478	our God,
c67479	let the sound of His praise be heard.
c67480	He preserves our lives
c67481	and keeps our feet from slipping.
c67482	For ... have tested us;
c67483	You , O God,
c67484	You have refined us
c67485	like silver.
c67486	You led us into the net;
c67487	You laid burdens on our backs.
c67488	You let men ride over our heads;
c67489	we went through fire and water,
c67490	but You brought us into abundance.
c67491	I will enter Your house with burnt offerings;
c67492	I will fulfill my vows to You—
c67493	[the vows] that my lips promised
c67494	and my mouth spoke in my distress.
c67495	I will offer You fatlings as burnt offerings, with the fragrant smoke of rams;
c67496	I will offer bulls and goats.
c67497	Selah
c67498	Come
c67499	and listen,
c67500	and I will declare
c67501	all you who fear God,
c67502	what He has done for me.
c67503	I cried out to Him with my mouth,
c67504	and His praise was on my tongue.
c67505	iniquity
c67506	If I had cherished ... in my heart,
c67507	the Lord would not have listened.
c67508	But God has surely heard;
c67509	He has attended to the sound of my prayer.
c67510	Blessed [be] God,
c67511	who has not rejected my prayer or withheld from me His loving devotion!
c67512	For the choirmaster.
c67513	With stringed instruments.
c67514	A Psalm. A Song.
c67515	May God be gracious to us
c67516	and bless us,
c67517	[and] cause His face to shine upon us,
c67518	Selah
c67519	that Your ways may be known on earth,
c67520	Your salvation among all nations.
c67521	Let the peoples praise You,
c67522	O God;
c67523	let all the peoples praise You.
c67524	be glad
c67525	Let the nations ... and sing for joy,
c67526	for You judge the peoples justly
c67527	the nations
c67528	and lead ... of the earth.
c67529	Selah
c67530	Let the peoples praise You,
c67531	O God;
c67532	let all the peoples praise You.
c67533	The earth has yielded its harvest;
c67534	God, our God, blesses us.
c67535	God blesses us,
c67536	that all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.
c67537	For the choirmaster.
c67538	Of David.
c67539	A Psalm ... A Song.
c67540	God arises.
c67541	His enemies are scattered,
c67542	and those who hate Him flee His presence.
c67543	As smoke is blown away,
c67544	You will drive [them] out;
c67545	as wax melts before the fire,
c67546	the wicked will perish in the presence of God.
c67547	But the righteous will be glad
c67548	[and] rejoice before God;
c67549	they will celebrate with joy.
c67550	Sing to God!
c67551	Sing praises to His name.
c67552	Exalt
c67553	the One who rides on the clouds—
c67554	His name is the LORD—
c67555	and rejoice before Him.
c67556	A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows, [is] God in His holy habitation.
c67557	God settles the lonely in families;
c67558	He leads the prisoners {out} to prosperity,
c67559	but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched [land].
c67560	O God,
c67561	when You went out before Your people,
c67562	when You marched through the wasteland,
c67563	Selah
c67564	the earth shook
c67565	and the heavens poured down [rain] before God,
c67566	the One [on] Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.
c67567	You sent abundant rain,
c67568	O God;
c67569	inheritance.
c67570	You refreshed Your weary
c67571	Your flock settled therein;
c67572	from Your bounty You provided for the poor.
c67573	O God,
c67574	The Lord gives the command;
c67575	a great company of women proclaim [it]:
c67576	“Kings [and their] armies flee
c67577	in haste;
c67578	she who waits at home will divide the plunder.
c67579	Though you lie down among the sheepfolds,
c67580	the wings of the dove are covered with silver,
c67581	and her feathers with shimmering gold.”
c67582	When the Almighty scattered the kings in [the land]
c67583	it was like the snow falling on Zalmon.
c67584	A mountain of God [is] the hill of Bashan;
c67585	a mount of many peaks [is] Mount Bashan.
c67586	Why do you gaze in envy,
c67587	O mountains of many peaks?
c67588	[This is] the mountain
c67589	God chose
c67590	for [His] dwelling,
c67591	where the LORD will surely dwell forever.
c67592	The chariots of God [are] tens of thousands— thousands of thousands [are they];
c67593	the Lord [is] in
c67594	His sanctuary [as He was at] Sinai.
c67595	You have ascended on high;
c67596	You have led captives away.
c67597	You have received gifts from men,
c67598	even [from] the rebellious,
c67599	may dwell [there].
c67600	that the LORD God
c67601	Blessed [be] the Lord,
c67602	[who] daily bears our burden,
c67603	the God of our salvation.
c67604	Selah
c67605	Our God [is] a God of deliverance;
c67606	the Lord GOD [is our] rescuer from death.
c67607	Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies,
c67608	the hairy crowns
c67609	of those who persist in guilty ways.
c67610	The Lord said,
c67611	“I will retrieve [them] from Bashan,
c67612	I will bring [them] up from the depths of the sea,
c67613	that your foot may be dipped in the blood
c67614	of [your] foes, the tongues of your dogs in [the same].”
c67615	They have seen Your procession,
c67616	O God—
c67617	the march of my God [and] King into the sanctuary.
c67618	The singers lead the way,
c67619	the musicians [follow] after,
c67620	among the maidens playing tambourines.
c67621	Bless God in the great congregation, [bless] the Lord from the fountain of Israel.
c67622	There [is] Benjamin, the youngest,
c67623	ruling them,
c67624	the princes of Judah [in] their company,
c67625	the princes of Zebulun
c67626	[and] of Naphtali.
c67627	Summon Your power, O God;
c67628	show Your strength,
c67629	O God,
c67630	which You have exerted on our behalf.
c67631	Because of Your temple at Jerusalem kings will bear you gifts.
c67632	Rebuke the beast in the reeds,
c67633	the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations,
c67634	[until] it submits, [bringing] bars of silver.
c67635	Scatter the nations
c67636	[who] delight in war.
c67637	Envoys will arrive from Egypt;
c67638	Cush will stretch out her hands to God.
c67639	O kingdoms of the earth;
c67640	Sing to God,
c67641	sing praises to the Lord,
c67642	Selah
c67643	to Him who rides upon the highest heavens of old;
c67644	behold, {His} mighty voice resounds.
c67645	Ascribe the power to God,
c67646	whose majesty [is] over Israel,
c67647	whose strength [is] in the skies.
c67648	[You are] awesome
c67649	O God,
c67650	in Your sanctuary;
c67651	the God of Israel
c67652	Himself gives strength and power to [His] people.
c67653	Blessed [be] God!
c67654	For the choirmaster.
c67655	To the tune of “Lilies.”
c67656	Of David.
c67657	Save me,
c67658	O God,
c67659	for the waters are up to my neck.
c67660	I have sunk into the miry depths,
c67661	where [there is] no footing;
c67662	I have drifted into deep waters,
c67663	where the flood engulfs me.
c67664	I am weary
c67665	from my crying;
c67666	my throat is parched.
c67667	My eyes fail,
c67668	looking for my God.
c67669	outnumber the hairs of my head;
c67670	Those who hate me without cause
c67671	many are those who would destroy me—
c67672	my enemies without cause.
c67673	Though I did not steal,
c67674	I must repay.
c67675	O God,
c67676	You know my folly,
c67677	and my guilt is not hidden from You.
c67678	not be ashamed through me,
c67679	May those who hope in You
c67680	O Lord GOD of Hosts;
c67681	not be dishonored through me,
c67682	may those who seek You
c67683	O God of Israel.
c67684	For I have endured scorn for Your sake,
c67685	and shame has covered my face.
c67686	I have become a stranger to my brothers
c67687	and a foreigner to my mother’s sons,
c67688	because zeal for Your house has consumed me,
c67689	and the insults of those who insult You have fallen on me.
c67690	I wept and fasted,
c67691	but it brought me reproach.
c67692	I made sackcloth my clothing,
c67693	and I was sport to them.
c67694	Those who sit at the gate mock me,
c67695	and I am the song of drunkards.
c67696	But
c67697	my prayer to You,
c67698	O LORD,
c67699	is for a time of favor.
c67700	O God,
c67701	In Your abundant loving devotion, ... answer me with Your sure salvation.
c67702	Rescue me from the mire
c67703	and do not let me sink;
c67704	deliver me from my foes and out of the deep waters.
c67705	Do not let the floods engulf me
c67706	or the depths swallow me up; let not
c67707	the Pit close its mouth over me.
c67708	Answer me,
c67709	O LORD,
c67710	for Your loving devotion is good;
c67711	turn to me in keeping with Your great compassion.
c67712	Hide not Your face from Your servant,
c67713	for I am in distress.
c67714	quickly!
c67715	Answer me
c67716	Draw near to my soul
c67717	and redeem me;
c67718	ransom me because of my foes.
c67719	You know my reproach, my shame and disgrace.
c67720	All my adversaries are before You.
c67721	Insults have broken my heart,
c67722	and I am in despair.
c67723	I looked
c67724	for sympathy,
c67725	but there was none,
c67726	for comforters,
c67727	but I found no one.
c67728	They poisoned my food with gall
c67729	and gave me vinegar to quench my thirst.
c67730	May their table become a snare;
c67731	may it be a retribution and a trap.
c67732	May their eyes be darkened
c67733	so they cannot see,
c67734	and their backs be bent forever.
c67735	Pour out Your wrath upon them,
c67736	and let Your burning anger overtake them.
c67737	May their place be deserted;
c67738	let there be no one to dwell in their tents.
c67739	For ... You
c67740	the one ... struck
c67741	they persecute
c67742	and recount the pain of those You wounded.
c67743	Add iniquity to their iniquity;
c67744	let them not share in Your righteousness.
c67745	May they be erased from the book of life
c67746	and not listed with the righteous.
c67747	But I [am] in pain and distress;
c67748	let Your salvation
c67749	O God.
c67750	protect me,
c67751	I will praise God’s name in song
c67752	and exalt Him with thanksgiving.
c67753	And this will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull
c67754	with horns
c67755	and hooves.
c67756	The humble will see
c67757	and rejoice.
c67758	You who seek God,
c67759	let your hearts be revived!
c67760	For the LORD listens to the needy
c67761	and does not despise His captive people.
c67762	Let heaven and earth praise Him,
c67763	the seas and all
c67764	that moves therein.
c67765	For God will save Zion
c67766	and rebuild the cities of Judah,
c67767	that they may dwell there
c67768	and possess it.
c67769	The descendants of His servants will inherit it,
c67770	and those who love His name will settle therein.
c67771	For the choirmaster.
c67772	Of David.
c67773	To bring remembrance.
c67774	[Make haste], O God,
c67775	to deliver me!
c67776	O LORD,
c67777	Hurry, ... to help me!
c67778	be ashamed
c67779	and confounded;
c67780	May those who seek my life
c67781	be repelled
c67782	may those who wish me harm ... and humiliated.
c67783	retreat because of their shame.
c67784	May those who say,
c67785	“Aha, aha!”
c67786	rejoice
c67787	May all ... and be glad in You;
c67788	who seek You
c67789	ever say,
c67790	“Let God be magnified!”
c67791	may those who love Your salvation
c67792	I am poor and needy;
c67793	O God.
c67794	hurry to me,
c67795	You are my help and my deliverer;
c67796	O LORD,
c67797	do not delay.
c67798	In You,
c67799	O LORD,
c67800	I have taken refuge;
c67801	let me never be put to shame.
c67802	In Your justice, rescue
c67803	and deliver me;
c67804	incline Your ear
c67805	and save me.
c67806	Be my rock of refuge,
c67807	where I can always go.
c67808	Give the command
c67809	to save me,
c67810	for You are my rock and my fortress.
c67811	O my God,
c67812	Deliver me, ... from the hand of the wicked,
c67813	from the grasp of the unjust and ruthless.
c67814	For You are my hope,
c67815	O Lord GOD,
c67816	my confidence from my youth.
c67817	I have leaned on You since birth;
c67818	You pulled me from my mother’s womb.
c67819	My praise is always for You.
c67820	I have become a portent to many,
c67821	but You are my strong refuge.
c67822	My mouth is filled [with] Your praise
c67823	[and with] Your splendor all day long.
c67824	Do not discard me in my old age;
c67825	when my strength fails.
c67826	do not forsake me
c67827	For my enemies speak against me,
c67828	and those who lie in wait for my life conspire,
c67829	saying,
c67830	“God has forsaken him;
c67831	pursue him
c67832	and seize him,
c67833	for there is no one to rescue him.”
c67834	O God.
c67835	Be not far from me,
c67836	O my God,
c67837	Hurry, ... to help me.
c67838	be ashamed
c67839	May the accusers of my soul ... [and] consumed;
c67840	be covered with scorn and disgrace.
c67841	may those who seek my harm
c67842	But I will always hope
c67843	and will praise You more and more.
c67844	My mouth will declare Your righteousness
c67845	and Your salvation all day long,
c67846	though I cannot know their full measure.
c67847	I will enter in the strength of the Lord GOD;
c67848	I will proclaim Your righteousness— Yours alone.
c67849	O God,
c67850	You have taught me from my youth,
c67851	and to this day I proclaim Your marvelous deeds.
c67852	Even when I am old and gray,
c67853	O God,
c67854	do not forsake me,
c67855	until I proclaim Your power to the next generation,
c67856	to all
c67857	who are to come.
c67858	Your might
c67859	Your righteousness
c67860	O God,
c67861	[reaches] to the heavens,
c67862	You who have done great things.
c67863	O God,
c67864	Who, ... is like You?
c67865	Though you have shown me many troubles and misfortunes,
c67866	once again.
c67867	You will revive me
c67868	Even from the depths of the earth ... back up.
c67869	You will bring me
c67870	You will increase my honor
c67871	me once again.
c67872	and comfort
c67873	So I will praise You with the harp
c67874	for Your faithfulness,
c67875	O my God;
c67876	I will sing praise to You with the lyre,
c67877	O Holy One of Israel.
c67878	My lips will shout for joy
c67879	when I sing praise to You,
c67880	along with my soul
c67881	which You have redeemed.
c67882	My tongue will indeed proclaim Your righteousness all day long,
c67883	for ... are disgraced
c67884	and confounded.
c67885	those who seek my harm
c67886	Of Solomon.
c67887	O God,
c67888	Endow the king with Your justice,
c67889	and the son of the king with Your righteousness.
c67890	He will judge Your people with righteousness
c67891	and Your afflicted with justice.
c67892	May the mountains bring peace to the people
c67893	and the hills [bring] righteousness.
c67894	May he vindicate the afflicted among the people;
c67895	may he save the children of the needy,
c67896	and crush the oppressor.
c67897	May they fear him as long as the sun [shines], as long as the moon [remains], through all generations.
c67898	May he be like rain that falls on freshly cut grass,
c67899	like spring showers that water the earth.
c67900	May the righteous flourish in his days
c67901	and prosperity abound, until the moon is no more.
c67902	May he rule from sea to sea, and from the [Euphrates] to the ends of the earth.
c67903	May the nomads bow before him,
c67904	and his enemies lick the dust.
c67905	May the kings of Tarshish and distant shores bring tribute;
c67906	may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
c67907	May all kings bow down to him
c67908	[and] all nations serve him.
c67909	For he shall deliver the needy
c67910	who cry out
c67911	and the afflicted
c67912	who have no helper.
c67913	He will have compassion on the poor and needy
c67914	and save the lives of the oppressed.
c67915	He will rescue them from oppression and violence,
c67916	for their blood is precious in his sight.
c67917	Long may he live!
c67918	May gold from Sheba be given him.
c67919	May people ever pray for him;
c67920	may they bless him all day long.
c67921	May there be an abundance of grain in the land; ... atop the hills.
c67922	may it sway ... May its fruit trees ... like [the forests of] Lebanon,
c67923	flourish ... and its people like the grass of the field.
c67924	May his name endure forever;
c67925	may his name increase as long as the sun shines.
c67926	In him ... be blessed;
c67927	may all nations ... may they call him blessed.
c67928	Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel,
c67929	who alone does marvelous deeds.
c67930	And blessed [be] His glorious name forever;
c67931	may all the earth be filled with His glory.
c67932	Amen and amen.
c67933	This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.
c67934	A Psalm of Asaph.
c67935	Surely God [is] good to Israel,
c67936	to those who are pure in heart.
c67937	But as for me,
c67938	my feet had almost stumbled;
c67939	my steps had nearly slipped.
c67940	For I envied the arrogant
c67941	[when] I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
c67942	They have no struggle in their death;
c67943	their bodies are well-fed.
c67944	They are free of the burdens others carry;
c67945	they are not afflicted like [other] men.
c67946	Therefore pride is their necklace;
c67947	a garment of violence covers them.
c67948	From their callous hearts proceeds iniquity;
c67949	the imaginations of their hearts run wild.
c67950	They mock
c67951	and speak with malice; ... oppression.
c67952	with arrogance they threaten
c67953	They set their mouths against the heavens,
c67954	and their tongues strut across the earth.
c67955	So His people return to this place
c67956	and drink up waters in abundance.
c67957	The wicked say,
c67958	“How can God know?
c67959	Does the Most High have knowledge?”
c67960	Behold, these [are] the wicked—
c67961	always carefree as they increase their wealth.
c67962	Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure;
c67963	in innocence I have washed my hands.
c67964	For I am afflicted all day long
c67965	and punished every morning.
c67966	If I had said,
c67967	“I will speak this way,”
c67968	then I would have betrayed Your children.
c67969	When I tried
c67970	to understand all this,
c67971	it was troublesome in my sight
c67972	until I entered God’s sanctuary;
c67973	then I discerned their end.
c67974	Surely You set them on slick ground;
c67975	You cast them down into ruin.
c67976	How suddenly they are laid waste,
c67977	swept away
c67978	completely ... by terrors!
c67979	Like a dream
c67980	when [one] awakens,
c67981	O Lord,
c67982	upon arising,
c67983	You will despise their form.
c67984	When my heart was grieved
c67985	and I was pierced within,
c67986	I was senseless
c67987	and ignorant;
c67988	I was a brute beast before You.
c67989	Yet I am always with You;
c67990	You hold my right hand.
c67991	You guide me with Your counsel,
c67992	and later receive me in glory.
c67993	Whom have I in heaven but You?
c67994	And on earth I desire no one besides You.
c67995	My flesh and my heart may fail,
c67996	but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
c67997	Those far from You will surely perish;
c67998	You destroy all
c67999	who are unfaithful to You.
c68000	But as for me,
c68001	[it is] good to draw near to God.
c68002	I have made the Lord GOD my refuge,
c68003	that I may proclaim all Your works.
c68004	A Maskil of Asaph.
c68005	Why
c68006	O God?
c68007	have You rejected us forever,
c68008	Why does Your anger burn against the sheep of Your pasture?
c68009	Remember Your congregation,
c68010	which You purchased long ago
c68011	and redeemed as the tribe of Your inheritance— Mount Zion
c68012	where You dwell.
c68013	Turn Your steps to the everlasting ruins,
c68014	to everything in the sanctuary the enemy has destroyed.
c68015	Your foes have roared within Your meeting place;
c68016	they have unfurled their banners as signs,
c68017	like men
c68018	wielding axes, in a thicket of trees,
c68019	and smashing all the carved work with hatchets and picks.
c68020	They have burned Your sanctuary
c68021	{to the ground}; they have defiled the dwelling place of Your name.
c68022	They said in their hearts,
c68023	“We will crush them completely.”
c68024	They burned down every place where God met us in the land.
c68025	There are no signs for us to see.
c68026	There is no longer any prophet.
c68027	And none of us knows
c68028	how long this will last.
c68029	How long,
c68030	O God,
c68031	will the enemy taunt You?
c68032	Will the foe revile Your name forever?
c68033	Why do You withdraw Your hand? ... Your right hand
c68034	Stretch out ... and destroy them!
c68035	Yet God [is] my King from of old,
c68036	working salvation on the earth.
c68037	You divided the sea by Your strength;
c68038	You smashed the heads of the dragons of the sea;
c68039	You crushed the heads of Leviathan;
c68040	You fed him to the creatures of the desert.
c68041	You broke open the fountain and the flood;
c68042	You dried up the ever-flowing rivers.
c68043	The day is Yours,
c68044	and also the night;
c68045	You established the moon and the sun.
c68046	You set all the boundaries of the earth;
c68047	the summer and winter.
c68048	You made
c68049	Remember how
c68050	the enemy has mocked You,
c68051	O LORD,
c68052	how a foolish people has spurned Your name.
c68053	Do not deliver the soul of Your dove to beasts;
c68054	do not forget the lives of Your afflicted forever.
c68055	Consider Your covenant,
c68056	for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.
c68057	Do not let the oppressed retreat
c68058	in shame;
c68059	may the poor and needy praise Your name.
c68060	Rise up,
c68061	O God,
c68062	defend Your cause!
c68063	Remember how the fool mocks You all day long.
c68064	Do not disregard the clamor of Your adversaries,
c68065	the uproar of Your enemies
c68066	that ascends continually.
c68067	For the choirmaster:
c68068	[To the tune of] “Do not Destroy.”
c68069	A Psalm of Asaph.
c68070	A Song.
c68071	We give thanks to You,
c68072	O God;
c68073	we give thanks,
c68074	for Your name is near.
c68075	The people declare Your wondrous works.
c68076	“When I choose a time,
c68077	I will judge fairly.
c68078	When the earth and all its dwellers quake,
c68079	it is I who bear up its pillars.
c68080	Selah
c68081	I say to the proud,
c68082	‘Do not boast,’
c68083	and to the wicked,
c68084	‘Do not lift up your horn.
c68085	Do not lift up your horn against heaven
c68086	or speak with an outstretched neck.’”
c68087	For ... comes not from east or west
c68088	exaltation ... or out of the desert,
c68089	but it is God who judges;
c68090	He brings one down
c68091	and exalts another.
c68092	For a cup is in the hand of the LORD,
c68093	foaming wine
c68094	full of ... mixed with spices,
c68095	He pours from it,
c68096	and ... it to the dregs.
c68097	all the wicked of the earth drink it down
c68098	But I will proclaim it forever;
c68099	I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
c68100	“All the horns of the wicked I will cut off,
c68101	but the horns of the righteous will be exalted.”
c68102	For the choirmaster.
c68103	With stringed instruments.
c68104	A Psalm of Asaph.
c68105	A Song.
c68106	God is known in Judah;
c68107	His name is great in Israel.
c68108	His tent is in Salem,
c68109	His dwelling place in Zion.
c68110	There He shattered the flaming arrows, the shield and sword and weapons of war.
c68111	Selah
c68112	You are resplendent with light,
c68113	more majestic than mountains filled with game.
c68114	The valiant lie plundered;
c68115	they sleep their last sleep.
c68116	No men of might could lift a hand.
c68117	At Your rebuke,
c68118	O God of Jacob,
c68119	lie stunned.
c68120	both horse and rider
c68121	You
c68122	alone are to be feared.
c68123	When You are angry, who can stand before You?
c68124	From heaven You pronounced judgment,
c68125	[and] the earth feared
c68126	and was still
c68127	when God rose up to judge,
c68128	to save all the lowly of the earth.
c68129	Selah
c68130	Even the wrath of man shall praise You;
c68131	with the survivors of wrath You will clothe Yourself.
c68132	Make
c68133	and fulfill your vows to the LORD your God;
c68134	let all the neighboring lands bring tribute to Him who is to be feared.
c68135	He breaks the spirits of princes;
c68136	He is feared by the kings of the earth.
c68137	For the choirmaster.
c68138	According to Jeduthun.
c68139	of Asaph.
c68140	A Psalm
c68141	I cried aloud to God,
c68142	I cried out
c68143	to God
c68144	to hear me.
c68145	In the day of trouble I sought the Lord;
c68146	through the night my outstretched hands
c68147	did not grow weary;
c68148	refused
c68149	to be comforted.
c68150	my soul
c68151	I remembered You, O God,
c68152	and I groaned;
c68153	I mused
c68154	[and] my spirit grew faint.
c68155	Selah
c68156	You have kept my eyes from closing;
c68157	I am too troubled
c68158	to speak.
c68159	I considered days of old, years long in the past.
c68160	At night I remembered my song;
c68161	in my heart I mused,
c68162	[and] my spirit pondered:
c68163	“Will the Lord spurn [us] forever
c68164	and never
c68165	show His favor again?
c68166	Is His loving devotion gone forever?
c68167	Has His promise failed for all time?
c68168	forgotten
c68169	to be gracious?
c68170	Has God
c68171	Has His anger shut off His compassion?”
c68172	Selah
c68173	So I said,
c68174	“I am grieved ... has changed.”
c68175	that the right hand of the Most High
c68176	I will remember the works of the LORD;
c68177	yes, I will remember Your wonders of old.
c68178	I will reflect on all You have done
c68179	and ponder Your mighty deeds.
c68180	O God,
c68181	Your way, ... is holy.
c68182	What god [is so] great as [our] God?
c68183	You are the God
c68184	who works wonders;
c68185	You display Your strength among the peoples.
c68186	With power You redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
c68187	Selah
c68188	The waters saw You,
c68189	O God;
c68190	the waters saw You
c68191	and swirled;
c68192	even the depths were shaken.
c68193	The clouds poured down water;
c68194	the skies resounded with thunder;
c68195	Your arrows flashed back and forth.
c68196	Your thunder resounded in the whirlwind;
c68197	the lightning lit up the world;
c68198	trembled
c68199	the earth ... and quaked.
c68200	Your path led through the sea,
c68201	Your way through the mighty waters,
c68202	but Your footprints were not to be found.
c68203	You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
c68204	A Maskil of Asaph.
c68205	Give ear,
c68206	O my people,
c68207	to my instruction;
c68208	listen to the words of my mouth.
c68209	I will open my mouth in parables;
c68210	I will utter things hidden from of old,
c68211	that we have heard
c68212	and known
c68213	and our fathers have relayed to us.
c68214	We will not hide [them] from their children,
c68215	but will declare to the next generation the praises of the LORD and His might, and the wonders
c68216	He has performed.
c68217	For He established a testimony in Jacob
c68218	and appointed a law in Israel,
c68219	which He commanded our fathers
c68220	to teach to their children,
c68221	that the coming generation might know—
c68222	even children
c68223	yet to be born—
c68224	to arise
c68225	and tell their children,
c68226	that they should put their confidence in God,
c68227	not forgetting [His] works,
c68228	but keeping His commandments.
c68229	Then they will not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation,
c68230	whose heart was not loyal,
c68231	whose spirit was not faithful to God.
c68232	The archers of Ephraim turned back on the day of battle.
c68233	They did not keep God’s covenant
c68234	and refused ... by His law.
c68235	to live
c68236	They forgot what He had done, the wonders
c68237	He had shown them.
c68238	He worked wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
c68239	He split the sea
c68240	and brought them through;
c68241	He set the waters {upright} like a wall.
c68242	He led them with a cloud by day
c68243	and with a light of fire all night.
c68244	He split the rocks in the wilderness
c68245	and gave [them] drink as abundant as the seas.
c68246	He brought streams from the stone
c68247	and made water flow down like rivers.
c68248	But they continued
c68249	to sin against Him,
c68250	rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
c68251	They willfully tested God
c68252	by demanding the food they craved.
c68253	They spoke against God,
c68254	saying,
c68255	“Can God
c68256	really prepare a table in the wilderness?
c68257	When He struck the rock,
c68258	water gushed out
c68259	and torrents overflowed.
c68260	But can He also ... bread
c68261	give
c68262	or supply His people with meat?”
c68263	Therefore the LORD heard
c68264	and was full of wrath;
c68265	so a fire was kindled against Jacob,
c68266	and His anger flared against Israel
c68267	because they did not believe God
c68268	or rely on His salvation.
c68269	Yet He commanded the clouds above
c68270	and opened the doors of the heavens.
c68271	He rained down manna for them
c68272	to eat;
c68273	He gave them grain from heaven.
c68274	Man ate the bread of angels;
c68275	He sent them food in abundance.
c68276	He stirred the east wind from the heavens
c68277	and drove the south wind by His might.
c68278	He rained meat on them like dust,
c68279	and winged birds like the sand of the sea.
c68280	He felled them in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.
c68281	So they ate
c68282	and were well filled,
c68283	for He gave them what they craved.
c68284	Yet before they had filled their desire,
c68285	with the food still in their mouths,
c68286	God’s anger flared against them,
c68287	and He put to death their strongest
c68288	and subdued the young men of Israel.
c68289	In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; despite
c68290	His wonderful works, they did not believe.
c68291	So He ended their days in futility,
c68292	and their years in sudden terror.
c68293	When He slew them,
c68294	they would seek Him;
c68295	they repented
c68296	and searched for God.
c68297	And they remembered
c68298	that God was their rock,
c68299	that God Most High was their Redeemer.
c68300	But they deceived Him with their mouths,
c68301	and lied to Him with their tongues.
c68302	Their hearts were disloyal to Him,
c68303	and they were unfaithful to His covenant.
c68304	Yet He was compassionate;
c68305	He forgave [their] iniquity
c68306	and did not destroy them.
c68307	He often
c68308	restrained His anger
c68309	and did not unleash His full wrath.
c68310	He remembered
c68311	that they were but flesh,
c68312	breeze
c68313	a passing
c68314	that does not return.
c68315	How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness
c68316	and grieved Him in the desert.
c68317	Again and again
c68318	they tested God
c68319	and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
c68320	They did not remember His power—
c68321	the day
c68322	He redeemed them from the adversary,
c68323	when He performed His signs in Egypt
c68324	and His wonders in the fields of Zoan.
c68325	He turned their rivers to blood, and from their streams
c68326	they could not drink.
c68327	He sent swarms of flies
c68328	that devoured them,
c68329	and frogs
c68330	that devastated them.
c68331	He gave their crops to the grasshopper,
c68332	the fruit of their labor to the locust.
c68333	He killed their vines with hailstones
c68334	and their sycamore-figs with sleet.
c68335	He abandoned their cattle to the hail
c68336	and their livestock to bolts of lightning.
c68337	He unleashed His fury against them, wrath, indignation, and calamity— a band of destroying angels.
c68338	He cleared a path for His anger;
c68339	He did not spare them from death
c68340	but delivered their lives to the plague.
c68341	He struck all the firstborn of Egypt,
c68342	the virility in the tents of Ham.
c68343	He led out His people like sheep
c68344	and guided them like a flock in the wilderness.
c68345	He led them safely,
c68346	so they did not fear,
c68347	but the sea engulfed their enemies.
c68348	He brought them to His holy land, to the hill country
c68349	His right hand had acquired.
c68350	He drove out nations before them
c68351	and apportioned their inheritance;
c68352	He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
c68353	But they tested
c68354	and disobeyed God Most High,
c68355	for they did not keep His decrees.
c68356	They turned back
c68357	and were faithless like their fathers,
c68358	twisted like a faulty bow.
c68359	They enraged Him with their high places
c68360	and provoked His jealousy with their idols.
c68361	On hearing it, God
c68362	was furious
c68363	and rejected Israel completely.
c68364	He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent
c68365	He had pitched among men.
c68366	He delivered His strength to captivity,
c68367	and His splendor to the hand of the adversary.
c68368	He surrendered His people to the sword
c68369	because He was enraged by His heritage.
c68370	Fire consumed His young men,
c68371	and their maidens were left without wedding songs.
c68372	His priests fell by the sword,
c68373	but His widows could not lament.
c68374	Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,
c68375	like a warrior
c68376	overcome by wine.
c68377	He beat back His foes;
c68378	He put them to everlasting shame.
c68379	He rejected the tent of Joseph
c68380	and refused the tribe of Ephraim.
c68381	But He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion,
c68382	which He loved.
c68383	He built His sanctuary like the heights,
c68384	like the earth
c68385	He has established forever.
c68386	He chose David His servant
c68387	and took him from the sheepfolds;
c68388	from tending the ewes He brought him
c68389	to be shepherd of His people Jacob, of Israel His inheritance.
c68390	So [David] shepherded them with integrity of heart
c68391	and guided them with skillful hands.
c68392	A Psalm of Asaph.
c68393	O God,
c68394	The nations, ... have invaded Your inheritance;
c68395	they have defiled Your holy temple
c68396	[and] reduced Jerusalem to rubble.
c68397	They have given the corpses of Your servants as food to the birds of the air,
c68398	the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.
c68399	They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem,
c68400	and [there is] no one to bury [the dead].
c68401	We have become a reproach to our neighbors,
c68402	a scorn and derision to those around us.
c68403	How long,
c68404	O LORD?
c68405	Will You be angry forever?
c68406	Will Your jealousy burn like fire?
c68407	Pour out Your wrath on the nations
c68408	that do not acknowledge You,
c68409	on the kingdoms
c68410	that refuse to call on Your name,
c68411	for they have devoured Jacob
c68412	and laid waste to his homeland.
c68413	Do not hold past sins against us;
c68414	quickly,
c68415	let Your compassion come
c68416	for we are brought low.
c68417	Help us,
c68418	O God of our salvation,
c68419	for the glory of Your name;
c68420	deliver us
c68421	and atone for our sins, for the sake of Your name.
c68422	Why should the nations ask,
c68423	“Where is their God?”
c68424	Before our eyes, make known among the nations Your vengeance for the bloodshed of Your servants.
c68426	May the groans of the captives reach You;
c68427	by the strength of Your arm preserve those condemned to death.
c68428	Pay back into the laps of our neighbors sevenfold the reproach
c68429	they hurled at You,
c68430	O Lord.
c68431	Then we Your people, the sheep of Your pasture, will thank You forever; from generation to generation,
c68432	we will declare Your praise.
c68433	For the choirmaster.
c68434	To the tune of
c68435	“The Lilies of the Covenant.” ... of Asaph.
c68436	A Psalm
c68437	O Shepherd of Israel,
c68438	Hear us,
c68439	who leads Joseph like a flock;
c68440	You who sit enthroned [between] the cherubim,
c68441	shine forth.
c68442	Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, rally Your power
c68443	and come to save us.
c68444	O God,
c68445	Restore us,
c68446	and cause Your face to shine upon us,
c68447	that we may be saved.
c68448	O LORD God of Hosts,
c68449	how long will Your anger smolder against the prayers of Your people?
c68450	You fed them with the bread of tears
c68451	and made them drink their full measure of tears.
c68452	You make us contend with our neighbors;
c68453	our enemies mock us.
c68454	O God of Hosts,
c68455	Restore us,
c68456	and cause Your face to shine upon us,
c68457	that we may be saved.
c68458	You uprooted a vine from Egypt;
c68459	You drove out the nations
c68460	and transplanted it.
c68461	You cleared the ground for it,
c68462	and it took root
c68463	and filled the land.
c68464	The mountains were covered by its shade,
c68465	and the mighty cedars with its branches.
c68466	It sent out its branches to the Sea,
c68467	and its shoots toward the River.
c68468	Why have You broken down its walls,
c68469	so that all who pass by pick its fruit?
c68470	The boar from the forest ravages it,
c68471	and the creatures of the field feed upon it.
c68472	O God of Hosts,
c68473	Return, ... we pray!
c68474	Look down from heaven
c68475	and see!
c68476	Attend to this vine,
c68477	the root
c68478	Your right hand has planted,
c68479	the branch
c68480	You have raised up for Yourself.
c68481	and burned;
c68482	[Your vine] has been cut down
c68483	they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.
c68484	Let Your hand be upon the man at Your right hand,
c68485	on the son of man
c68486	You have raised up for Yourself.
c68487	Then we will not turn away from You;
c68488	revive us,
c68489	and we will call on Your name.
c68490	O LORD God of Hosts;
c68491	Restore us,
c68492	cause Your face to shine upon us,
c68493	that we may be saved.
c68494	For the choirmaster.
c68495	According to Gittith.
c68496	Of Asaph.
c68497	Sing for joy to God our strength;
c68498	make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.
c68499	Lift up a song,
c68500	strike the tambourine,
c68501	play the sweet-sounding harp and lyre.
c68502	Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon,
c68503	[and] at the full moon on the day of our Feast.
c68504	For this is a statute for Israel,
c68505	an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
c68506	He ordained it as a testimony for Joseph
c68507	when he went out over the land of Egypt,
c68508	language:
c68509	an unfamiliar
c68510	[where] I heard
c68511	“I relieved his shoulder of the burden;
c68512	his hands were freed from the basket.
c68513	You called out in distress,
c68514	and I rescued you;
c68515	I answered you from the cloud of thunder;
c68516	I tested you at the waters of Meribah.
c68517	Selah
c68518	Hear,
c68519	O My people,
c68520	and I will warn you:
c68521	O Israel,
c68522	if only you would listen to Me!
c68523	There must be no strange god among you,
c68524	nor shall you bow to a foreign god.
c68525	I am the LORD your God,
c68526	who brought you up out of Egypt.
c68527	Open wide your mouth,
c68528	and I will fill it.
c68529	But My people would not listen to Me,
c68530	and Israel would not obey Me.
c68531	So I gave them up to their stubborn hearts
c68532	to follow their own devices.
c68533	If only My people would listen to Me,
c68534	if Israel would follow My ways,
c68535	how soon I would subdue their enemies
c68536	and turn My hand against their foes.
c68537	Those who hate the LORD would feign obedience,
c68538	and their doom would last forever.
c68539	But I would feed you the finest wheat;
c68540	with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
c68541	A Psalm of Asaph.
c68542	God presides in the divine assembly;
c68543	He renders judgment among the gods:
c68544	“How long will you judge unjustly
c68545	and show partiality to the wicked?
c68546	Selah
c68547	Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless;
c68548	uphold the rights of the afflicted and oppressed.
c68549	Rescue the weak and needy;
c68550	save them from the hand of the wicked.
c68551	They do not know
c68552	or understand;
c68553	they wander in the darkness;
c68554	all the foundations of the earth are shaken.”
c68555	I have said,
c68556	“You are gods;
c68557	you are all sons of the Most High.
c68558	But like mortals you will die,
c68559	and like rulers you will fall.”
c68560	Rise up,
c68561	O God,
c68562	judge the earth,
c68563	for all the nations are Your inheritance.
c68564	A Song.
c68565	A Psalm of Asaph.
c68566	O God,
c68567	do not keep silent;
c68568	do not hold Your peace;
c68569	do not be still,
c68570	O God.
c68571	See how Your enemies rage,
c68572	how your foes have reared their heads.
c68573	With cunning they scheme against Your people
c68574	and conspire against those You cherish,
c68575	saying,
c68576	“Come,
c68577	let us erase them as a nation;
c68578	may the name of Israel be remembered no more.”
c68579	For with one mind they plot together,
c68580	they form an alliance against You—
c68581	the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,
c68582	Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with the people of Tyre.
c68583	Even Assyria has joined them,
c68584	lending strength to the sons of Lot.
c68585	Selah
c68586	Do to them as You did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the River Kishon,
c68587	who perished at Endor
c68588	and became [like] dung on the ground.
c68589	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
c68590	and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
c68591	who said,
c68592	“Let us possess for ourselves the pastures of God.”
c68593	O my God,
c68594	Make them like tumbleweed,
c68595	like chaff before the wind.
c68596	As fire
c68597	consumes a forest,
c68598	as a flame
c68599	sets the mountains {ablaze},
c68600	so pursue them with Your tempest,
c68601	and terrify them with Your storm.
c68602	Cover their faces with shame,
c68603	that they may seek Your name,
c68604	O LORD.
c68605	May they be ever ashamed
c68606	and terrified;
c68607	in disgrace.
c68608	may they perish
c68609	May they know
c68610	that You alone, whose name is the LORD,
c68611	are Most High over all the earth.
c68612	For the choirmaster.
c68613	According to Gittith.
c68614	of the sons of Korah.
c68615	A Psalm
c68616	How lovely is Your dwelling place,
c68617	O LORD of Hosts.
c68618	longs,
c68619	My soul ... even faints, for the courts of the LORD;
c68620	my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
c68621	Even the sparrow has found a home,
c68622	and the swallow a nest for herself
c68623	where she places her young
c68624	by Your altars,
c68625	O LORD of Hosts, my King and my God.
c68626	How blessed are those who dwell in Your house;
c68627	they are ever praising You.
c68628	Selah
c68629	Blessed are those
c68630	whose strength is in You,
c68631	whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
c68632	As they pass through the Valley of Baca,
c68633	they make it a place of springs;
c68634	even the autumn rain covers it with pools.
c68635	They go from strength to strength,
c68636	until each appears before God in Zion.
c68637	O LORD God of Hosts,
c68638	hear my prayer;
c68639	give ear,
c68640	O God of Jacob.
c68641	Selah
c68642	our shield,
c68643	Behold
c68644	O God,
c68645	and look with favor on the face of Your anointed.
c68646	For better is one day in Your courts than a thousand elsewhere.
c68647	I would rather
c68648	be a doorkeeper in the house of my God
c68649	than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.
c68650	For the LORD God is a sun and a shield;
c68651	the LORD gives grace and glory;
c68652	He withholds no good thing
c68653	from those who walk with integrity.
c68654	O LORD of Hosts,
c68655	how blessed is the man
c68656	who trusts in You!
c68657	For the choirmaster.
c68658	of the sons of Korah.
c68659	A Psalm
c68660	You showed favor
c68661	O LORD;
c68662	to Your land,
c68663	You restored Jacob from captivity.
c68664	You forgave the iniquity of Your people;
c68665	You covered all their sin.
c68666	Selah
c68667	You withheld all Your fury;
c68668	You turned from Your burning anger.
c68669	Restore us,
c68670	O God of our salvation,
c68671	and put away Your displeasure toward us.
c68672	Will You be angry with us forever?
c68673	Will You draw out Your anger to all generations?
c68674	Will You not ... us again,
c68675	revive
c68676	that Your people may rejoice in You?
c68677	Show
c68678	O LORD,
c68679	us Your loving devotion,
c68680	and grant us Your salvation.
c68681	I will listen
c68682	to what God the LORD will say;
c68683	for He will surely speak peace to His people and His saints;
c68684	He will not let them return to folly.
c68685	Surely His salvation [is] near to those who fear Him,
c68686	that His glory may dwell in our land.
c68687	Loving devotion and truth have joined together;
c68688	righteousness and peace have kissed.
c68689	Truth sprouts from the earth,
c68690	and righteousness looks down from heaven.
c68691	The LORD will indeed provide what is good,
c68692	and our land will yield its increase.
c68693	Righteousness will go before Him
c68694	to prepare the way for His steps.
c68695	A Prayer of David.
c68696	Incline
c68697	O LORD,
c68698	Your ear,
c68699	and answer me,
c68700	for I am poor and needy.
c68701	Preserve my soul,
c68702	for I [am] godly.
c68703	You ... save Your servant
c68704	are my God;
c68705	who trusts in You.
c68706	Be merciful to me,
c68707	O Lord,
c68708	for I call to You all day long.
c68709	Bring joy to Your servant,
c68710	for to You,
c68711	O Lord,
c68712	I lift up my soul.
c68713	For You,
c68714	O Lord,
c68715	are kind and forgiving, rich in loving devotion to all who call on You.
c68716	Hear
c68717	O LORD,
c68718	my prayer,
c68719	and attend to my plea for mercy.
c68720	In the day of my distress I will call on You,
c68721	for You will answer me.
c68722	[there is] none like You among the gods,
c68723	O Lord,
c68724	nor any works like Yours.
c68725	All the nations
c68726	You have made
c68727	will come
c68728	and bow before You,
c68729	O Lord,
c68730	and they will glorify Your name.
c68731	For You are great
c68732	and perform wonders;
c68733	You alone are God.
c68734	Teach me
c68735	O LORD,
c68736	Your way,
c68737	and I will walk in Your truth.
c68738	Grant me undividedness of heart
c68739	so that I may fear Your name.
c68740	I will praise You,
c68741	O Lord my God,
c68742	with all my heart;
c68743	I will glorify Your name forever.
c68744	For great is Your loving devotion to me;
c68745	You have delivered me from the depths of Sheol.
c68746	O God;
c68747	The arrogant rise against me,
c68748	a band of ruthless men seeks my life,
c68749	with no regard for You.
c68750	But You,
c68751	O Lord,
c68752	are a compassionate and gracious God,
c68753	slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and truth.
c68754	Turn to me
c68755	and have mercy;
c68756	grant Your strength to Your servant;
c68757	save the son of Your maidservant.
c68758	Show me a sign of Your goodness,
c68759	that my enemies may see
c68760	and be ashamed,
c68761	for You,
c68762	O LORD,
c68763	have helped me
c68764	and comforted me.
c68765	of the sons of Korah.
c68766	A Psalm
c68767	A Song.
c68768	His foundation [is] on the holy mountains.
c68769	The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
c68770	Glorious things are ascribed to you,
c68771	O city of God.
c68772	Selah
c68773	I will mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me—
c68774	along with Philistia, Tyre, and Cush—
c68775	[when I say,] “This one was born [in Zion].”
c68776	And it will be said of Zion:
c68777	“This one and that one were born in her,
c68778	Himself will establish her.”
c68779	and the Most High
c68780	The LORD will record
c68781	in the register of the peoples:
c68782	“This one was born [in Zion].”
c68783	Selah
c68784	Singers and pipers will say:
c68785	“All my springs [of joy] [are] in You.”
c68786	A Song.
c68787	A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
c68788	For the choirmaster.
c68789	According to Mahalath
c68790	Leannoth.
c68791	A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.
c68792	O LORD, the God of my salvation,
c68793	day ... I cry out
c68794	and night ... before You.
c68795	May my prayer come before You;
c68796	incline Your ear to my cry.
c68797	For my soul is full of troubles,
c68798	and my life draws near to Sheol.
c68799	I am counted among those descending to the pit.
c68800	I am like a man
c68801	without strength.
c68802	I am forsaken among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave,
c68803	whom You remember no more,
c68804	who are cut off from Your care.
c68805	You have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest of the depths.
c68806	Your wrath weighs heavily upon me;
c68807	all Your waves have submerged [me].
c68808	Selah
c68809	You have removed my friends from me;
c68810	You have made me repulsive to them;
c68811	I am confined
c68812	and cannot escape.
c68813	My eyes grow dim with grief.
c68814	I call to You
c68815	O LORD;
c68816	daily,
c68817	I spread out my hands to You.
c68818	Do You work wonders for the dead?
c68819	Do departed spirits rise up
c68820	to praise You?
c68821	Selah
c68822	Can Your loving devotion be proclaimed in the grave,
c68823	Your faithfulness in Abaddon?
c68824	Will Your wonders be known in the darkness,
c68825	or Your righteousness in the land of oblivion?
c68826	But to You,
c68827	O LORD,
c68828	I cry for help;
c68829	in the morning my prayer comes before You.
c68830	Why,
c68831	O LORD,
c68832	do You reject me?
c68833	Why do You hide Your face from me?
c68834	I [was] afflicted
c68835	From my youth ... and near death.
c68836	I suffer Your terrors;
c68837	I am in despair.
c68838	Your wrath has swept over me;
c68839	Your terrors have destroyed me.
c68840	All day long they engulf me like water;
c68841	they enclose me on every side.
c68842	You have removed my beloved and my friend;
c68843	darkness is my closest companion.
c68844	A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.
c68845	I will sing of the LORD’s loving devotion forever;
c68846	with my mouth I will proclaim Your faithfulness to all generations.
c68847	For I have said,
c68848	“Loving devotion is built up forever;
c68849	in the heavens
c68850	You establish Your faithfulness.”
c68851	You said, “I have made a covenant with My chosen one,
c68852	I have sworn to David My servant:
c68853	‘I will establish your offspring forever
c68854	and build up your throne for all generations.’”
c68855	Selah
c68856	The heavens praise Your wonders,
c68857	O LORD—
c68858	Your faithfulness as well— in the assembly of the holy ones.
c68859	For who in the skies can compare with the LORD?
c68860	Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD?
c68861	In the council of the holy ones, God is greatly feared,
c68862	and awesome above all who surround Him.
c68863	O LORD God of Hosts,
c68864	who is like You? O mighty
c68865	LORD,
c68866	Your faithfulness surrounds You.
c68867	You rule the raging sea;
c68868	when its waves mount up,
c68869	You still them.
c68870	You crushed Rahab like a carcass;
c68871	You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.
c68872	The heavens are Yours,
c68873	and also the earth.
c68874	The world and its fullness
c68875	You founded.
c68876	North and south
c68877	You created;
c68878	Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name.
c68879	Mighty is Your arm,
c68880	strong is Your hand;
c68881	Your right hand is exalted.
c68882	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne;
c68883	loving devotion and truth go before You.
c68884	Blessed are those
c68885	who know the joyful sound,
c68886	O LORD,
c68887	who walk, ... in the light of Your presence.
c68888	They rejoice in Your name all day long,
c68889	and in Your righteousness they exult.
c68890	For You [are] the glory of their strength,
c68891	and by Your favor our horn is exalted.
c68892	Surely our shield belongs to the LORD,
c68893	and our king to the Holy One of Israel.
c68894	You once spoke in a vision, to Your godly ones
c68895	You said,
c68896	“I have bestowed help on a warrior;
c68897	I have exalted one chosen from the people.
c68898	I have found David My servant;
c68899	with My sacred oil I have anointed him.
c68900	My hand will sustain him;
c68901	surely My arm will strengthen him.
c68902	No enemy will exact tribute;
c68903	no wicked man will oppress him.
c68904	I will crush his foes before him
c68905	and strike down those who hate him.
c68906	My faithfulness and loving devotion will be with him,
c68907	and through My name his horn will be exalted.
c68908	I will set his hand over the sea,
c68909	and his right hand upon the rivers.
c68910	He will call to Me,
c68911	‘You are my Father,
c68912	my God, the rock of my salvation.’
c68913	I will indeed appoint him as My firstborn,
c68914	the highest of the kings of the earth.
c68915	I will forever preserve My loving devotion for him,
c68916	and My covenant with him will stand fast.
c68917	I will establish his line forever,
c68918	his throne as long as the heavens endure.
c68919	If his sons forsake My law
c68920	and do not walk in My judgments,
c68921	if they violate My statutes
c68922	and fail to keep My commandments,
c68923	I will attend to their transgression with the rod,
c68924	and to their iniquity with stripes.
c68925	But I will not withdraw My loving devotion from him,
c68926	nor ever betray My faithfulness.
c68927	I will not violate My covenant
c68928	or alter the utterance of My lips.
c68929	Once and for all I have sworn by My holiness—
c68930	I will not lie to David—
c68931	his offspring will endure forever,
c68932	and his throne will be like the sun before Me,
c68933	like the moon, established forever,
c68934	a faithful witness in the sky.”
c68935	Selah
c68936	But You have spurned
c68937	and rejected him;
c68938	You are enraged by Your anointed one.
c68939	You have renounced the covenant with Your servant
c68940	and sullied his crown in the dust.
c68941	You have broken down all his walls;
c68942	You have reduced his strongholds to rubble.
c68943	All who pass by plunder him;
c68944	he has become a reproach to his neighbors.
c68945	You have exalted the right hand of his foes;
c68946	You have made all his enemies rejoice.
c68947	You have bent the edge of his sword
c68948	and have not sustained him in battle.
c68949	You have ended his splendor
c68950	and cast his throne to the ground.
c68951	You have shortened the days of his youth;
c68952	You have covered him with shame.
c68953	Selah
c68954	How long,
c68955	O LORD?
c68956	Will You hide Yourself forever?
c68957	Will Your wrath keep burning like fire?
c68958	Remember
c68959	is my lifespan.
c68960	how short
c68961	For what futility You have created all men!
c68962	What man
c68963	can live
c68964	and never see death?
c68965	Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?
c68966	Selah
c68967	Where, ... [is] Your loving devotion of old,
c68968	O Lord,
c68969	which You swore steadfastly to David?
c68970	Remember,
c68971	O Lord,
c68972	the reproach of Your servants,
c68973	which I bear in my heart from so many people,
c68974	how Your enemies have taunted,
c68975	O LORD,
c68976	how they have mocked every step of Your anointed one.
c68977	Blessed be the LORD forever!
c68978	Amen and amen.
c68979	A prayer of Moses, the man of God.
c68980	Lord,
c68981	You have been our dwelling place through all generations.
c68982	Before the mountains were born,
c68983	or You brought forth the earth and world,
c68984	from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.
c68985	You return man to dust
c68986	and say,
c68987	“Return,
c68988	O sons of mortals.”
c68989	For in Your sight a thousand years are but a day
c68990	that passes,
c68991	or a watch of the night.
c68992	You whisk them away
c68993	in their sleep; they are
c68994	like the new grass of the morning—
c68996	in the morning it springs up
c68997	new;
c68998	by evening it fades
c68999	and withers.
c69000	For we are consumed by Your anger
c69001	and terrified by Your wrath.
c69002	You have set our iniquities before You,
c69003	our secret [sins] in the light of Your presence.
c69004	For all our days decline in Your fury;
c69005	we finish our years with a sigh.
c69006	The length of our days
c69007	is seventy years—
c69009	if we are strong—
c69010	or eighty
c69011	yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,
c69012	for they quickly pass,
c69013	and we fly away.
c69014	Who knows the power of Your anger?
c69015	Your wrath matches the fear You are due.
c69016	us to number our days,
c69017	So teach
c69018	that we may present a heart of wisdom.
c69019	Return,
c69020	O LORD!
c69021	How long will it be?
c69022	Have compassion on Your servants.
c69023	Satisfy us in the morning with Your loving devotion,
c69024	that we may sing for joy
c69025	and be glad all our days.
c69026	Make us glad for as many days
c69027	as You have afflicted us,
c69028	for as many years
c69029	as we have seen evil.
c69030	May Your work be shown to Your servants,
c69031	and Your splendor to their children.
c69032	May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us;
c69033	establish for us the work of our hands—
c69034	the work of our hands!
c69035	establish
c69036	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
c69037	will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
c69038	I will say to the LORD,
c69039	“[You are] my refuge and fortress, my God,
c69040	in whom I trust.”
c69041	Surely He will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,
c69042	and from the deadly plague.
c69043	He will cover you with His feathers;
c69044	under His wings you will find refuge;
c69045	His faithfulness is a shield and rampart.
c69046	You will not fear the terror of the night,
c69047	or the arrow
c69048	that flies by day,
c69049	the plague
c69050	that stalks in darkness,
c69051	or the calamity
c69052	that destroys at noon.
c69053	Though a thousand may fall at your side,
c69054	and ten thousand at your right hand,
c69055	no [harm] will come near you.
c69056	You will only see it with your eyes
c69057	and witness the punishment of the wicked.
c69058	Because you
c69059	the LORD
c69060	my refuge,
c69061	have made ... your dwelling— ... the Most High—
c69062	no evil will befall you,
c69063	no plague will approach your tent.
c69064	For He will command His angels concerning you
c69065	to guard you in all your ways.
c69066	They will lift you up in their hands,
c69067	so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
c69068	You will tread on the lion and cobra;
c69069	you will trample the young lion and serpent.
c69070	“Because he loves Me,
c69071	I will deliver him;
c69072	I will protect him.
c69073	because he knows My name,
c69074	When he calls out to Me,
c69075	I will answer him;
c69076	I will be with him in trouble.
c69077	I will deliver
c69078	and honor him.
c69079	With long life I will satisfy him
c69080	and show him My salvation.”
c69081	A Psalm.
c69082	A Song for the Sabbath day.
c69083	It is good
c69084	to praise the LORD,
c69085	and to sing praises to Your name,
c69086	O Most High,
c69087	to proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning,
c69088	and Your faithfulness at night,
c69089	with the ten-stringed harp and the melody of the lyre.
c69090	For ... have made me glad
c69091	You, O LORD,
c69092	by Your deeds;
c69093	I will sing for joy at the works of Your hands.
c69094	How great are Your works,
c69095	O LORD,
c69096	how deep are Your thoughts!
c69097	A senseless man does not know,
c69098	and a fool does not understand,
c69099	that though the wicked sprout like grass,
c69100	and all evildoers flourish,
c69101	they will be forever destroyed.
c69102	But You, ... are exalted forever.
c69103	O LORD,
c69104	For surely Your enemies,
c69105	O LORD,
c69106	surely Your enemies will perish;
c69107	all evildoers will be scattered.
c69108	But You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox;
c69109	with fine oil I have been anointed.
c69110	My eyes see the downfall of my enemies;
c69111	attack me,
c69112	when evildoers
c69113	my ears are open.
c69114	The righteous will flourish like a palm tree,
c69115	and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
c69116	Planted in the house of the LORD,
c69117	they will flourish in the courts of our God.
c69118	In old age they will still bear fruit;
c69119	healthy and green they will remain,
c69120	to proclaim,
c69121	“The LORD [is] upright; He is my rock,
c69122	and in Him there is no unrighteousness.”
c69123	The LORD reigns!
c69124	He is robed in majesty;
c69125	the LORD has clothed ... with strength.
c69126	and armed Himself
c69127	The world indeed is firmly established;
c69128	it cannot be moved.
c69129	Your throne [was] established long ago;
c69130	You [are] from all eternity.
c69131	The floodwaters have risen,
c69132	O LORD,
c69133	the rivers have raised their voice;
c69134	the seas lift up their pounding waves.
c69135	Above the roar of many waters— the mighty breakers of the sea—
c69136	the LORD on high is majestic.
c69137	Your testimonies are fully confirmed;
c69138	holiness adorns Your house,
c69139	O LORD,
c69140	for all the days to come.
c69141	God of vengeance,
c69142	O LORD,
c69143	O God of vengeance,
c69144	shine forth.
c69145	Rise up,
c69146	O Judge of the earth;
c69147	render a reward to the proud.
c69148	How long will the wicked,
c69149	O LORD,
c69150	how long will the wicked exult?
c69151	They pour out
c69152	arrogant words;
c69153	all workers of iniquity boast.
c69154	Your people,
c69155	O LORD;
c69156	They crush
c69157	they oppress Your heritage.
c69158	They kill the widow and the foreigner;
c69159	they murder the fatherless.
c69160	They say,
c69161	“The LORD does not see;
c69162	the God of Jacob pays no heed.”
c69163	Take notice,
c69164	O senseless among the people!
c69166	O fools,
c69167	when will you be wise?
c69168	He who affixed the ear,
c69169	can He not hear?
c69170	He who formed the eye,
c69171	can He not see?
c69172	He who admonishes the nations,
c69173	does He not discipline?
c69174	He who teaches man, does He [lack] knowledge?
c69175	The LORD knows the thoughts of man,
c69176	that they are futile.
c69177	Blessed [is] the man
c69178	You discipline,
c69179	O LORD,
c69180	and teach from Your law,
c69181	to grant him relief from days of trouble,
c69182	until a pit is dug for the wicked.
c69183	For the LORD will not forsake His people;
c69184	He will never abandon His heritage.
c69185	Surely judgment will again be righteous,
c69186	and all the upright in heart will follow it.
c69187	Who will rise up for me against the wicked?
c69188	Who will stand for me against the workers of iniquity?
c69189	Unless the LORD had been my helper,
c69190	I would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence.
c69191	If I say,
c69192	“My foot is slipping,”
c69193	Your loving devotion,
c69194	O LORD,
c69195	will support me.
c69196	When anxiety abounds within me, Your comforts delight my soul.
c69197	Can a corrupt throne be Your ally—
c69198	one devising mischief by decree?
c69199	They band together against the righteous
c69200	and condemn the innocent to death.
c69201	But the LORD has been my stronghold,
c69202	and my God is my rock of refuge.
c69203	He will bring upon them their own iniquity
c69204	and destroy them for their wickedness.
c69205	The LORD our God will destroy them.
c69206	Come,
c69207	let us sing for joy to the LORD;
c69208	let us shout to the rock of our salvation!
c69209	Let us enter His presence with thanksgiving;
c69210	let us make a joyful noise to Him in song.
c69211	For the LORD is a great God,
c69212	a great King above all gods.
c69213	In His hand are the depths of the earth,
c69214	and the mountain peaks belong to Him.
c69215	The sea is His,
c69216	for He made it,
c69217	and His hands formed the dry land.
c69218	O come,
c69219	let us worship
c69220	and bow down;
c69221	let us kneel before the LORD
c69222	our Maker.
c69223	For He is our God,
c69224	and we are the people of His pasture, the sheep under His care.
c69225	Today,
c69226	if you hear His voice,
c69227	do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah,
c69228	as on that day at Massah in the wilderness,
c69229	where your fathers tested
c69230	and tried Me,
c69231	though they had seen My work.
c69232	For forty years I was angry with that generation,
c69233	and I said,
c69234	“They are a people whose hearts go astray,
c69235	and they have not known My ways.”
c69236	So I swore on oath in My anger,
c69237	“They shall never enter My rest.”
c69238	Sing to the LORD a new song;
c69239	sing to the LORD,
c69240	all the earth.
c69241	Sing to the LORD,
c69242	praise His name;
c69243	proclaim His salvation day after day.
c69244	Declare His glory among the nations,
c69245	His wonderful deeds among all peoples.
c69246	For great is the LORD,
c69247	and greatly to be praised;
c69248	He is to be feared above all gods.
c69249	For all the gods of the nations are idols,
c69250	but [it is] the LORD who made the heavens.
c69251	Splendor and majesty are before Him;
c69252	strength and beauty fill His sanctuary.
c69253	Ascribe to the LORD,
c69254	O families of the nations,
c69255	ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
c69256	Ascribe to the LORD the glory [due] His name;
c69257	bring an offering
c69258	and enter His courts.
c69259	Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness;
c69260	tremble before Him,
c69261	all the earth.
c69262	Declare among the nations:
c69263	“The LORD reigns.”
c69264	The world is firmly established;
c69265	it cannot be moved;
c69266	He judges the peoples with equity.
c69267	Let the heavens be glad
c69268	and the earth rejoice;
c69269	let the sea resound, and all that fills it.
c69270	Let the fields exult, and all
c69271	that [is] in them.
c69272	Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy
c69273	before the LORD,
c69274	for He is coming—
c69275	He is coming
c69276	to judge the earth.
c69277	He will judge the world in righteousness
c69278	and the peoples in His faithfulness.
c69279	The LORD reigns,
c69280	let the earth rejoice;
c69281	let the distant shores be glad.
c69282	Clouds and darkness surround Him;
c69283	righteousness and justice are His throne’s foundation.
c69284	Fire goes before Him
c69285	and consumes His foes on every side.
c69286	His lightning illuminates the world;
c69287	sees
c69288	the earth ... and trembles.
c69289	The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.
c69290	The heavens proclaim His righteousness;
c69291	all the peoples see His glory.
c69292	All who worship images are put to shame,
c69293	those who boast in idols—
c69294	worship Him,
c69295	all [you] gods!
c69296	hears
c69297	Zion ... and rejoices,
c69298	and the towns of Judah exult because of Your judgments,
c69299	O LORD.
c69300	For You,
c69301	O LORD,
c69302	are Most High over all the earth;
c69303	You are exalted far above all gods.
c69304	O you who love the LORD,
c69305	hate evil!
c69306	He preserves the souls of His saints;
c69307	He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
c69308	Light is sown on the righteous,
c69309	gladness on the upright in heart.
c69310	Rejoice
c69311	you righteous ones,
c69312	in the LORD,
c69313	and praise His holy name.
c69314	A Psalm.
c69315	Sing to the LORD a new song,
c69316	for He has done wonders;
c69317	His right hand and holy arm have gained Him the victory
c69318	The LORD has proclaimed His salvation
c69319	[and] revealed His righteousness to the nations.
c69320	He has remembered His love and faithfulness to the house of Israel;
c69321	all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
c69322	Make a joyful noise to the LORD,
c69323	all the earth;
c69324	break forth—
c69325	let your cry ring out
c69326	and sing praises!
c69327	Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre,
c69328	in melodious song with the harp.
c69329	With trumpets and the blast of the horn
c69330	shout for joy before the LORD, the King.
c69331	Let the sea resound, and all that fills it,
c69332	the world, and all who live in it.
c69333	Let the rivers clap their hands,
c69334	let the mountains sing together for joy
c69335	before the LORD,
c69336	for He comes
c69337	to judge the earth.
c69338	He will judge the world with righteousness,
c69339	and the peoples with equity.
c69340	The LORD reigns,
c69341	let the nations tremble!
c69342	He is enthroned above the cherubim.
c69343	Let the earth quake.
c69344	Great is the LORD in Zion;
c69345	He is exalted above all the peoples.
c69346	Let them praise Your great and awesome name—
c69347	He is holy!
c69348	The mighty King loves justice.
c69349	You have established equity;
c69350	You have exercised justice and righteousness in Jacob.
c69351	Exalt the LORD our God,
c69352	and worship at His footstool;
c69353	He is holy!
c69354	Moses and Aaron were among His priests,
c69355	and Samuel among those who called on His name.
c69356	They called to the LORD
c69357	and He answered.
c69358	He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud;
c69359	they kept His decrees and the statutes
c69360	He gave them.
c69361	O LORD our God,
c69362	You answered them.
c69363	You were a forgiving God to them,
c69364	yet an avenger of their misdeeds.
c69365	Exalt the LORD our God
c69366	and worship at His holy mountain,
c69367	for the LORD our God is holy.
c69368	A Psalm of thanksgiving.
c69369	Make a joyful noise to the LORD,
c69370	all the earth.
c69371	Serve the LORD with gladness;
c69372	come into His presence with joyful songs.
c69373	Know
c69374	that the LORD
c69375	is God.
c69376	[It is] He [who] made us,
c69377	and we are His; [we are] His people, and the sheep of His pasture.
c69378	Enter His gates with thanksgiving
c69379	and His courts with praise;
c69380	give thanks to Him
c69381	[and] bless His name.
c69382	For the LORD is good,
c69383	and His loving devotion endures forever;
c69384	His faithfulness continues to all generations.
c69385	of David.
c69386	A Psalm
c69387	I will sing of [Your] loving devotion and justice;
c69388	to You,
c69389	O LORD,
c69390	I will sing praise.
c69391	I will ponder the way that is blameless—
c69392	when will You come to me?
c69393	I will walk in my house with integrity of heart.
c69394	I will set no worthless thing before my eyes.
c69395	the work of those who fall away;
c69396	I hate
c69397	it shall not cling to me.
c69398	A perverse heart shall depart from me;
c69399	I will know nothing of evil.
c69400	Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret,
c69401	I will put to silence;
c69402	the one with haughty eyes and a proud heart,
c69403	I will not endure.
c69404	My eyes [will be] on the faithful of the land,
c69405	that they may dwell with me;
c69406	he who walks in the way of integrity
c69407	shall minister to me.
c69408	No ... shall dwell in my house;
c69409	one who practices deceit
c69410	one who tells lies
c69411	no ... shall stand in my presence.
c69412	Every morning I will remove all the wicked of the land,
c69413	that I may cut off every evildoer from the city of the LORD.
c69414	A prayer of one who is afflicted,
c69415	when he grows faint
c69416	and pours out his lament before the LORD.
c69417	O LORD;
c69418	Hear my prayer,
c69419	let my cry for help come before You.
c69420	Do not hide Your face from me
c69421	in the day
c69422	of my distress.
c69423	Incline Your ear to me;
c69424	when
c69425	I call.
c69426	me quickly
c69427	answer
c69428	For my days vanish like smoke,
c69429	and my bones burn like glowing embers.
c69430	is afflicted, ... like grass;
c69431	My heart ... and withered
c69432	I even forget
c69433	to eat my bread.
c69434	Through my loud groaning, my flesh clings to my bones.
c69435	like a desert owl,
c69436	I am ... like an owl among the ruins.
c69437	I lie awake;
c69438	I am ... bird
c69439	like a lone ... on a housetop.
c69440	All day long my enemies taunt me;
c69441	they ridicule and curse me.
c69442	For I have eaten ashes like bread
c69443	and mixed my drink with tears,
c69444	because of Your indignation and wrath;
c69445	for You have picked me up
c69446	and cast me aside.
c69447	My days are like lengthening shadows,
c69448	and I wither away like grass.
c69449	But You,
c69450	O LORD,
c69451	sit enthroned forever;
c69452	Your renown endures to all generations.
c69453	You will rise up
c69454	and have compassion on Zion,
c69455	for it is time
c69456	to show her favor—
c69457	the appointed time has come.
c69458	For Your servants delight in her stones
c69459	and take pity on her dust.
c69460	So the nations will fear the name of the LORD,
c69461	and all the kings of the earth [will fear] Your glory,
c69462	for the LORD will rebuild Zion;
c69463	He has appeared in His glory.
c69464	He will turn toward the prayer of the destitute;
c69465	He will not despise their prayer.
c69466	Let this be written for the generation to come,
c69467	that a people not yet created may praise the LORD.
c69468	For He looked down from the heights of His sanctuary;
c69469	the LORD gazed out from heaven to earth,
c69470	to hear a prisoner’s groaning,
c69471	to release those condemned to death,
c69472	that they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion
c69473	and His praise in Jerusalem,
c69474	when peoples ... assemble
c69475	and kingdoms
c69476	to serve the LORD.
c69477	He has broken my strength on the way;
c69478	He has shortened my days.
c69479	I say:
c69480	“O my God,
c69481	do not take me in the midst of my days!
c69482	Your years [go on] through all generations.
c69483	In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth,
c69484	and the heavens are the work of Your hands.
c69485	They will perish,
c69486	but You remain;
c69487	they will all wear out like a garment.
c69488	Like clothing You will change them,
c69489	and they will be passed on.
c69490	But You remain the same,
c69491	and Your years will never end.
c69492	The children of Your servants will dwell securely,
c69493	and their descendants will be established before You.”
c69494	Of David.
c69495	Bless
c69496	O my soul,
c69497	the LORD,
c69499	and all that is within me,
c69500	[bless] His holy name.
c69501	Bless
c69502	O my soul,
c69503	the LORD,
c69504	and do not forget all His kind deeds—
c69505	He who forgives all your iniquities,
c69506	and heals all your diseases,
c69507	who redeems your life from the pit,
c69508	[and] crowns you with loving devotion and compassion,
c69509	who satisfies you with good things,
c69510	so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
c69511	The LORD executes righteousness
c69512	and justice for all the oppressed.
c69513	He revealed His ways to Moses,
c69514	His deeds to the people of Israel.
c69515	The LORD is compassionate and gracious,
c69516	slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion.
c69517	He will not always accuse us,
c69518	nor harbor [His anger] forever.
c69519	He has not dealt ... our sins
c69520	with us according to ... or repaid us according to our iniquities.
c69521	For
c69522	as high as the heavens are above the earth,
c69523	so great is His loving devotion for those who fear Him.
c69524	As far as the east ... the west,
c69525	is from ... so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
c69526	As a father has compassion on his children,
c69527	so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.
c69528	For He knows our frame;
c69529	He is mindful
c69530	that we are dust.
c69531	As for man,
c69532	his days are like grass—
c69533	like a flower of the field;
c69534	he blooms
c69535	when the wind has passed over,
c69536	it vanishes,
c69537	and its place remembers it no more.
c69538	But from everlasting to everlasting the loving devotion of the LORD extends to those who fear Him,
c69539	and His righteousness to their children’s children—
c69540	to those who keep His covenant and remember ... His precepts.
c69541	to obey
c69542	The LORD has established His throne in heaven,
c69543	and His kingdom rules over all.
c69544	Bless the LORD,
c69545	all His angels mighty in strength,
c69546	who do His word,
c69547	who hearken to the voice of His command.
c69548	Bless the LORD,
c69549	all His hosts, you servants
c69550	who do His will.
c69551	Bless the LORD,
c69552	all His works in all places of His dominion.
c69553	Bless
c69554	O my soul!
c69555	the LORD,
c69556	Bless
c69557	O my soul.
c69558	the LORD,
c69559	O LORD my God,
c69560	You are very great;
c69561	You are clothed with splendor and majesty.
c69562	He wraps Himself in light as [with] a garment;
c69563	He stretches out the heavens like a tent,
c69564	laying the beams of his chambers on the waters above,
c69565	making the clouds His chariot,
c69566	walking on the wings of the wind.
c69567	He makes the winds His messengers,
c69568	flames of fire His servants.
c69569	He set the earth on its foundations,
c69570	never to be moved.
c69571	it with the deep
c69572	You covered ... like a garment;
c69573	the waters stood above the mountains.
c69574	At Your rebuke the waters fled;
c69575	at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away—
c69576	the mountains rose
c69577	and the valleys sank to the place
c69578	You appointed for them—
c69579	You set a boundary
c69580	they cannot cross;
c69581	they will never again
c69582	cover the earth.
c69583	He sends forth springs in the valleys;
c69584	they flow between the mountains.
c69585	They give drink to every beast of the field;
c69586	the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
c69587	The birds of the air nest beside the springs;
c69588	they sing among the branches.
c69589	He waters the mountains from His chambers;
c69590	the earth is satisfied by the fruit of His works.
c69591	He makes the grass grow for the livestock
c69592	and provides crops for man to cultivate,
c69593	bringing forth food from the earth:
c69594	wine
c69595	that gladdens the heart of man,
c69596	oil that makes his face to shine
c69597	and bread
c69598	that sustains [his] heart.
c69599	The trees of the LORD have their fill,
c69600	the cedars of Lebanon
c69601	that He planted,
c69602	where the birds build their nests;
c69603	the stork
c69604	makes her home in the pines.
c69605	The high mountains are for the wild goats,
c69606	the cliffs a refuge for the coneys.
c69607	He made the moon to mark the seasons;
c69608	the sun knows when to set.
c69609	You bring darkness,
c69610	and it becomes night,
c69611	when all the beasts of the forest prowl.
c69612	The young lions roar for their prey
c69613	and seek their food from God.
c69614	The sun rises,
c69615	and they withdraw;
c69616	they lie down in their dens.
c69617	Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until evening.
c69618	How many are Your works,
c69619	O LORD!
c69620	In wisdom You have made them all;
c69621	the earth is full of Your creatures.
c69622	Here is the sea,
c69623	vast and wide,
c69624	teeming with creatures
c69625	beyond number,
c69626	living things both great and small.
c69627	There the ships pass,
c69628	and Leviathan,
c69629	which You formed
c69630	to frolic there.
c69631	All [creatures] look to You
c69632	to give [them] their food in due season.
c69633	When You give it to them,
c69634	they gather it up;
c69635	when You open Your hand,
c69636	they are satisfied with good things.
c69637	When You hide Your face,
c69638	they panic;
c69639	when You take away their breath,
c69640	they die
c69641	and return to dust.
c69642	When You send Your Spirit,
c69643	they are created,
c69644	and You renew the face of the earth.
c69645	May the glory of the LORD endure forever;
c69646	may the LORD rejoice in His works.
c69647	He looks on the earth,
c69648	and it trembles;
c69649	He touches the mountains,
c69650	and they smolder.
c69651	I will sing to the LORD all my life;
c69652	I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
c69653	May my meditation be pleasing to Him,
c69654	for I rejoice in the LORD.
c69655	May sinners vanish from the earth
c69656	and the wicked
c69657	be no more.
c69658	Bless
c69659	O my soul.
c69660	the LORD,
c69661	Hallelujah!
c69662	Give thanks to the LORD,
c69663	call upon His name;
c69664	make known His deeds among the nations.
c69665	Sing to Him,
c69666	sing praises to Him;
c69667	tell of all His wonders.
c69668	Glory in His holy name;
c69669	let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
c69670	Seek out the LORD and His strength;
c69671	seek His face always.
c69672	Remember the wonders
c69673	He has done,
c69674	His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced,
c69675	O offspring of Abraham His servant,
c69676	O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
c69677	He is the LORD our God;
c69678	His judgments [carry] throughout the earth.
c69679	He remembers His covenant forever,
c69680	the word
c69681	He ordained for a thousand generations—
c69682	[the covenant] He made with Abraham,
c69683	and the oath He swore to Isaac.
c69684	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
c69685	to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
c69687	“I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.”
c69688	When they were few in number, few indeed,
c69689	and strangers in [the land],
c69690	they wandered from nation to nation,
c69691	from [one] kingdom to another.
c69692	He let no man
c69693	oppress them;
c69694	He rebuked kings on their behalf:
c69695	“Do not touch My anointed ones;
c69696	do no harm to My prophets.”
c69697	He called down famine on the land
c69698	and cut off all their supplies of food.
c69699	He sent a man before them—
c69700	Joseph, sold as a slave.
c69701	They bruised his feet with shackles
c69702	[and] placed his neck in irons,
c69703	until
c69704	his prediction came true,
c69705	the word of the LORD tested him.
c69706	The king sent
c69707	and released him;
c69708	the ruler of peoples
c69709	set him free.
c69710	He made him master of his household,
c69711	ruler over all his substance,
c69712	to instruct his princes as he pleased
c69713	and teach his elders {wisdom}.
c69714	Then Israel went to Egypt;
c69715	Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
c69716	And the LORD made His people very fruitful,
c69717	more numerous than their foes,
c69718	whose hearts He turned
c69719	to hate His people,
c69720	to conspire against His servants.
c69721	He sent Moses His servant,
c69722	and Aaron,
c69723	whom He had chosen.
c69724	They performed His miraculous signs among them,
c69725	and wonders in the land of Ham.
c69726	He sent darkness,
c69727	and it became dark—
c69728	for had they not defied His words?
c69729	He turned their water to blood
c69730	and caused their fish to die.
c69731	Their land teemed with frogs, even in their royal chambers.
c69732	He spoke,
c69733	and insects swarmed—
c69734	gnats throughout their country.
c69735	He gave them hail for rain,
c69736	with lightning throughout their land.
c69737	He struck their vines and fig trees
c69738	and shattered the trees of their country.
c69739	He spoke,
c69740	and the locusts came—
c69741	young locusts
c69742	without number.
c69743	They devoured every plant in their land
c69744	and consumed the produce of their soil.
c69745	Then He struck all the firstborn in their land,
c69746	the firstfruits of all their vigor.
c69747	Then He brought [Israel] out with silver and gold,
c69748	and none among His tribes stumbled.
c69749	Egypt was glad
c69750	when they departed,
c69751	for the dread of Israel had fallen on them.
c69752	He spread a cloud as a covering
c69753	and a fire
c69754	to light up the night.
c69755	They asked,
c69756	and He brought quail
c69757	and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
c69758	He opened a rock,
c69759	and water gushed out;
c69760	it flowed [like] a river in the desert.
c69761	For He remembered His holy promise
c69762	to Abraham His servant.
c69763	He brought forth His people with rejoicing,
c69764	His chosen with shouts of joy.
c69765	He gave them the lands of the nations,
c69766	that they might inherit the fruit of others’ labor,
c69767	that they might keep His statutes
c69768	and observe His laws.
c69769	Hallelujah!
c69770	Hallelujah!
c69771	Give thanks to the LORD,
c69772	for He is good;
c69773	His loving devotion endures forever.
c69774	Who can describe the mighty acts of the LORD
c69775	or fully proclaim His praise?
c69776	Blessed [are]
c69777	those who uphold justice,
c69778	who practice righteousness at all times.
c69779	Remember me,
c69780	O LORD,
c69781	in [Your] favor to Your people.
c69782	Visit me with Your salvation,
c69783	that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones,
c69784	and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,
c69785	and give glory with Your inheritance.
c69786	We have sinned like our fathers;
c69787	we have done wrong
c69788	[and] acted wickedly.
c69789	Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders
c69790	or remember Your abundant kindness;
c69791	but they rebelled by the sea, [there] at the Red Sea.
c69792	Yet He saved them for the sake of His name,
c69793	to make His power known.
c69794	He rebuked the Red Sea,
c69795	and it dried up;
c69796	He led them through the depths as through a desert.
c69797	He saved them from the hand that hated them,
c69798	and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
c69799	The waters covered their foes;
c69800	not one of them remained.
c69801	Then they believed His promises
c69802	and sang His praise.
c69803	[Yet] they soon
c69804	forgot His works
c69805	and failed to wait for His counsel.
c69806	They craved intensely in the wilderness
c69807	and tested God in the desert.
c69808	So He granted their request,
c69809	but sent a wasting disease upon them.
c69810	In the camp they envied Moses
c69811	and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.
c69812	The earth opened up
c69813	and swallowed Dathan;
c69814	it covered the assembly of Abiram.
c69815	Then fire blazed through their company;
c69816	flames consumed the wicked.
c69817	At Horeb they made a calf
c69818	and worshiped a molten image.
c69819	They exchanged their Glory for the image of an ox
c69820	that eats grass.
c69821	They forgot God their Savior,
c69822	who did great things in Egypt,
c69823	wondrous works in the land of Ham,
c69824	[and] awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
c69825	So He said
c69826	He would destroy them—
c69827	had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach
c69828	to divert His wrath
c69829	from destroying them.
c69830	They despised the pleasant land;
c69831	they did not believe His promise.
c69832	They grumbled in their tents
c69833	and did not listen to the voice of the LORD.
c69834	So He raised His hand {and swore}
c69835	to cast them down in the wilderness,
c69836	to disperse their offspring among the nations
c69837	and scatter them throughout the lands.
c69838	They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor
c69839	and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.
c69840	So they provoked [the LORD] to anger with their deeds,
c69841	and a plague broke out among them.
c69842	But Phinehas stood
c69843	and intervened,
c69844	and the plague was restrained.
c69845	It was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.
c69846	At the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD,
c69847	and trouble came to Moses because of them.
c69848	For they rebelled against His Spirit,
c69849	and [Moses] spoke rashly with his lips.
c69850	They did not destroy the peoples
c69851	as the LORD had commanded them,
c69852	but they mingled with the nations
c69853	and adopted their customs.
c69854	They worshiped their idols,
c69855	which became a snare to them.
c69856	They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
c69857	They shed innocent blood— the blood of their sons and daughters,
c69858	whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
c69859	and the land was polluted with blood.
c69860	They defiled themselves by their actions
c69861	and prostituted themselves by their deeds.
c69862	So the anger of the LORD was kindled against His people,
c69863	and He abhorred His own inheritance.
c69864	He delivered them into the hand of the nations,
c69865	and those who hated them ruled over them.
c69866	Their enemies oppressed them,
c69867	and subdued them under their hand.
c69868	Many times He rescued them,
c69869	but they were bent on rebellion
c69870	and sank down in their iniquity.
c69871	He took note of their distress.
c69872	Nevertheless He heard their cry;
c69873	And He remembered His covenant with them,
c69874	and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion.
c69875	He made them objects of compassion to all who held them captive.
c69876	Save us,
c69877	O LORD our God,
c69878	and gather us from the nations,
c69879	that we may give thanks to Your holy name,
c69880	that we may glory in Your praise.
c69881	Blessed [be] the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
c69882	Let all the people say,
c69883	“Amen!” Hallelujah!
c69884	Give thanks to the LORD,
c69885	for He is good;
c69886	His loving devotion endures forever.
c69887	Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,
c69888	whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy
c69889	and gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.
c69890	Some wandered in desert wastelands, ... path
c69891	finding no ... to a city to dwell in.
c69892	They were hungry
c69893	and thirsty;
c69894	their soul fainted within them.
c69895	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; ... them
c69896	He delivered ... from their distress.
c69897	He led them on a straight path
c69898	to reach a city where they could live.
c69899	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.
c69900	For He satisfies the thirsty
c69901	and fills the hungry with good things.
c69902	Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
c69903	prisoners in misery and chains,
c69904	because they rebelled against the words of God
c69905	and despised the counsel of the Most High.
c69906	He humbled their hearts with hard labor;
c69907	they stumbled,
c69908	and there was no one to help.
c69909	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; ... them
c69910	He saved ... from their distress.
c69911	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death
c69912	and broke away their chains.
c69913	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.
c69914	For He has broken down the gates of bronze
c69915	and cut through the bars of iron.
c69916	Fools, in their rebellious ways, and through their iniquities, suffered affliction.
c69917	They loathed all food
c69918	and drew near to the gates of death.
c69919	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble;
c69920	He saved them from their distress.
c69921	He sent forth His word
c69922	and healed them;
c69923	He rescued them from the Pit.
c69924	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.
c69925	Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving
c69926	and declare His works with rejoicing.
c69927	Others went out to sea in ships,
c69928	conducting trade on the mighty waters.
c69929	They saw the works of the LORD, and His wonders in the deep.
c69930	For He spoke
c69931	and raised a tempest
c69932	that lifted the waves of [the sea].
c69933	They mounted up to the heavens,
c69934	they sunk to the depths;
c69935	their courage melted in their anguish.
c69936	They reeled
c69937	and staggered like drunkards,
c69938	and all their skill was useless.
c69939	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, ... them out
c69940	and He brought ... of their distress.
c69941	He calmed the storm to a whisper,
c69942	and the waves of the sea were hushed.
c69943	They rejoiced
c69944	in the silence
c69945	and He guided them to the harbor they desired.
c69946	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.
c69947	Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people
c69948	and praise Him in the council of the elders.
c69949	He turns rivers into deserts,
c69950	springs of water into thirsty ground,
c69951	fruitful land into fields of salt, because of the wickedness of its dwellers.
c69952	He turns a desert into pools of water,
c69953	and a dry land into flowing springs.
c69954	He causes the hungry to settle there,
c69955	that they may establish a city to dwell.
c69956	They sow fields
c69957	and plant vineyards
c69958	that yield a fruitful harvest.
c69959	He blesses them,
c69960	and they multiply greatly;
c69961	He does not let their herds diminish.
c69962	When they are decreased
c69963	and humbled by oppression, evil, and sorrow,
c69964	He pours contempt on the nobles
c69965	and makes them wander ... wasteland.
c69966	a pathless
c69967	But He lifts the needy from affliction
c69968	and increases their families like flocks.
c69969	The upright see
c69970	and rejoice,
c69971	and all iniquity shuts its mouth.
c69972	Let him who is wise
c69973	pay heed to these things
c69974	and consider the loving devotion of the LORD.
c69975	A Song.
c69976	A Psalm of David.
c69977	My heart is steadfast,
c69978	O God;
c69979	I will sing
c69980	and make music
c69981	with all my being.
c69982	Awake,
c69983	O harp and lyre!
c69984	I will awaken the dawn.
c69985	I will praise You, ... among the peoples;
c69986	O LORD,
c69987	I will sing Your praises
c69988	among the nations.
c69989	For Your loving devotion is higher than the heavens,
c69990	and Your truth reaches to the skies.
c69991	Be exalted, ... above the heavens,
c69992	O God,
c69993	and let Your glory cover the earth.
c69994	That Your beloved may be delivered,
c69995	save [me] by Your right hand
c69996	and answer me!
c69997	God has spoken in His sanctuary:
c69998	“I will triumph!
c69999	I will parcel out Shechem,
c70000	and apportion the Valley of Succoth.
c70001	Gilead is Mine,
c70002	Manasseh is Mine;
c70003	Ephraim is My helmet
c70004	and Judah My scepter.
c70005	Moab is My washbasin;
c70006	on Edom I toss My sandal;
c70007	over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
c70008	Who will bring me to the fortified city?
c70009	Who will lead me to Edom?
c70010	Have You
c70011	O God?
c70012	rejected us,
c70013	Do You no longer march out,
c70014	O God,
c70015	with our armies?
c70016	Give us aid against the foe,
c70017	for the help of man is worthless.
c70018	With God we perform with valor,
c70019	and He will trample our enemies.
c70020	For the choirmaster.
c70021	of David.
c70022	A Psalm
c70023	O God of my praise,
c70024	do not be silent.
c70025	For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me;
c70026	they speak against me with lying tongues.
c70027	They surround me with hateful words
c70028	and attack me without cause.
c70029	In return for my love they accuse me,
c70030	but I [am a man] [of] prayer.
c70031	They repay me evil for good,
c70032	and hatred for my love.
c70033	Set over him a wicked man;
c70034	let an accuser stand at his right hand.
c70035	When he is tried,
c70036	let him be found guilty,
c70037	and may his prayer be regarded as sin.
c70038	May his days be few;
c70039	may another take his position.
c70040	May his children be fatherless
c70041	and his wife a widow.
c70042	May his children wander
c70043	as beggars;
c70044	may they seek sustenance far from their ruined homes.
c70045	May the creditor seize all
c70046	he owns,
c70047	and strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.
c70048	May there be none to
c70049	extend kindness,
c70050	[and] no one
c70051	to favor his fatherless children.
c70052	May his descendants be
c70053	cut off;
c70054	may their name be blotted out from the next generation.
c70055	May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD,
c70056	and the sin of his mother never be erased.
c70057	May [their sins] always remain before the LORD,
c70058	that He may cut off their memory from the earth.
c70059	For he never thought
c70060	to show kindness,
c70061	but pursued the poor and needy and brokenhearted,
c70062	even to their death.
c70063	The cursing he loved,
c70064	may it fall on him;
c70065	the blessing he refused to delight in,
c70066	may it be far from him.
c70067	The cursing he wore like a coat,
c70068	may it soak into his body like water,
c70069	and into his bones like oil.
c70070	May it be like a robe
c70071	wrapped about him,
c70072	like a belt
c70073	tied forever around him.
c70074	May this be the LORD’s reward to my accusers,
c70075	to those who speak evil against me.
c70076	But You,
c70077	O GOD, the Lord,
c70078	deal kindly with me for the sake of Your name;
c70079	by the goodness of Your loving devotion.
c70080	deliver me
c70081	For I [am] poor and needy;
c70082	my heart is wounded within me.
c70083	shadow;
c70084	like a lengthening
c70085	I am fading away
c70086	I am shaken off like a locust.
c70087	My knees are weak from fasting,
c70088	and my body grows lean and gaunt.
c70089	I am an object of scorn to [my accusers];
c70090	when they see me,
c70091	they shake their heads.
c70092	Help me,
c70093	O LORD my God;
c70094	save me according to Your loving devotion.
c70095	Let them know
c70096	that this [is] Your hand, that
c70097	You,
c70098	O LORD,
c70099	have done it.
c70100	Though they curse,
c70101	You will bless.
c70102	When they rise up,
c70103	they will be put to shame,
c70104	but Your servant will rejoice.
c70105	My accusers will be clothed with disgrace;
c70106	they will wear their shame like a robe.
c70107	With my mouth I will thank the LORD profusely;
c70108	I will praise Him in the presence of many.
c70109	For He stands at the right hand of the needy one,
c70110	to save him from the condemners of his soul.
c70111	of David.
c70112	A Psalm
c70113	The LORD said to my Lord:
c70114	“Sit at My right hand
c70115	until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”
c70116	The LORD will extend Your mighty scepter from Zion:
c70117	“Rule in the midst of your enemies.”
c70118	Your people [shall be] willing on Your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor,
c70119	from the womb of the dawn, to You belongs the dew of Your youth.
c70120	The LORD has sworn
c70121	and will not change His mind:
c70122	“You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”
c70123	The Lord is at Your right hand; He will crush kings in the day of His wrath.
c70124	He will judge the nations,
c70125	heaping up the dead;
c70126	He will crush the leaders far and wide.
c70127	He will drink from the brook by the road;
c70128	therefore He will lift up His head.
c70129	Hallelujah!
c70130	I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly.
c70131	Great are the works of the LORD;
c70132	they are pondered by all who delight in them.
c70133	Splendid and majestic is His work;
c70134	His righteousness endures forever.
c70135	He has caused His wonders to be remembered;
c70136	the LORD is gracious and compassionate.
c70137	He provides food to those who fear Him;
c70138	He remembers His covenant forever.
c70139	He has shown His people the power of His works
c70140	by giving them the inheritance of the nations.
c70141	The works of His hands are truth and justice;
c70142	all His precepts are trustworthy.
c70143	They are upheld forever and ever,
c70144	enacted in truth and uprightness.
c70145	He has sent redemption to His people;
c70146	He has ordained His covenant forever;
c70147	holy and awesome is His name.
c70148	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom;
c70149	all who follow [His precepts] have a rich understanding.
c70150	His praise endures forever!
c70151	Hallelujah!
c70152	Blessed is the man
c70153	who fears the LORD,
c70154	who greatly delights in His commandments.
c70155	His descendants will be mighty in the land;
c70156	the generation of the upright will be blessed.
c70157	Wealth and riches are in his house,
c70158	and his righteousness endures forever.
c70159	Light dawns in the darkness for the upright,
c70160	for the one who is gracious, compassionate, and righteous.
c70161	It is well with the man who is generous and lends freely,
c70162	whose affairs are guided by justice.
c70163	Surely he will never be shaken.
c70164	The righteous man will be remembered forever.
c70165	He will not fear bad news;
c70166	his heart is steadfast,
c70167	trusting in the LORD.
c70168	His heart is assured;
c70169	he will not fear,
c70170	until he looks in triumph on his foes.
c70171	He has scattered abroad
c70172	his gifts to the poor;
c70173	his righteousness endures forever.
c70174	His horn will be lifted high in honor.
c70175	The wicked man will see
c70176	and be grieved;
c70177	he will gnash his teeth
c70178	and waste away;
c70179	the desires of the wicked will perish.
c70180	Hallelujah!
c70181	Give praise,
c70182	O servants of the LORD;
c70183	praise the name of the LORD.
c70184	Blessed be the name of the LORD both now and forevermore.
c70185	From the rising to the setting of the sun, the name of the LORD [is] praised.
c70186	The LORD is exalted over all the nations,
c70187	His glory above the heavens.
c70188	Who is like the LORD our God,
c70189	on high?
c70190	the One enthroned
c70191	He humbles Himself
c70192	to behold the heavens and the earth.
c70193	He raises the poor from the dust
c70194	and lifts the needy from the dump
c70195	to seat them with nobles, with the princes of His people.
c70196	He settles the barren woman in her home,
c70197	as a joyful mother to her children.
c70198	Hallelujah!
c70199	When Israel departed from Egypt,
c70200	the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,
c70201	Judah became [God’s] sanctuary,
c70202	Israel His dominion.
c70203	The sea observed
c70204	and fled;
c70205	the Jordan turned back;
c70206	the mountains skipped like rams,
c70207	the hills like lambs.
c70208	Why was it,
c70209	O sea,
c70210	that you fled,
c70211	O Jordan,
c70212	that you turned back,
c70213	O mountains,
c70214	that you skipped like rams,
c70215	O hills,
c70216	like lambs?
c70217	Tremble, ... at the presence of the Lord,
c70218	O earth,
c70219	at the presence of the God of Jacob,
c70220	who turned the rock into a pool,
c70221	the flint into a fountain of water.
c70222	Not to us,
c70223	O LORD,
c70224	not to us,
c70225	but to Your name be the glory, because of Your loving devotion, because of Your faithfulness.
c70226	Why should the nations say,
c70227	“Where is their God?”
c70228	Our God is in heaven
c70229	as
c70230	He pleases.
c70231	and does
c70232	Their idols are silver and gold,
c70233	made by the hands of men.
c70234	They have mouths,
c70235	but cannot speak;
c70236	they have eyes,
c70237	but cannot see;
c70238	they have ears,
c70239	but cannot hear;
c70240	they have noses,
c70241	but cannot smell;
c70242	they have hands,
c70243	but cannot feel;
c70244	they have feet,
c70245	but cannot walk.
c70246	They cannot utter a sound with their throats.
c70247	Those who make them will be like them,
c70248	as will all
c70249	who trust in them.
c70250	O Israel,
c70251	trust in the LORD!
c70252	He is their help and shield.
c70253	O house of Aaron,
c70254	trust in the LORD!
c70255	He is their help and shield.
c70256	You who fear the LORD,
c70257	trust in the LORD!
c70258	He is their help and shield.
c70259	The LORD is mindful of us;
c70260	He will bless us.
c70261	He will bless the house of Israel;
c70262	He will bless the house of Aaron;
c70263	He will bless those who fear the LORD— small and great alike.
c70264	May the LORD give you increase, both you and your children.
c70265	May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
c70266	The highest heavens belong to the LORD,
c70267	but the earth He has given to mankind.
c70268	It is not the dead who praise the LORD,
c70269	nor any who descend into silence.
c70270	But it is we who will bless the LORD, both now and forevermore.
c70271	Hallelujah!
c70272	I love
c70273	the LORD, for He has heard my voice— my appeal for mercy.
c70274	Because He has inclined His ear to me,
c70275	I will call on Him as long as I live.
c70276	The ropes of death entangled me,
c70277	and the anguish of Sheol overcame me;
c70278	I was confronted by trouble and sorrow.
c70279	Then I called on the name of the LORD:
c70281	“O LORD,
c70282	deliver my soul!”
c70283	The LORD is gracious
c70284	and righteous;
c70285	our God is full of compassion.
c70286	The LORD preserves the simplehearted;
c70287	I was helpless,
c70288	and He saved me.
c70289	Return to your rest,
c70290	O my soul,
c70292	for the LORD has been good to you.
c70293	For You have delivered my soul from death,
c70294	my eyes from tears,
c70295	my feet from stumbling.
c70296	I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
c70297	I believed,
c70298	therefore I have spoken:
c70299	“I am greatly afflicted.”
c70300	I said,
c70301	In my alarm
c70302	“All men [are] liars!”
c70303	How can I repay the LORD for all His goodness to me?
c70304	I will lift the cup of salvation
c70305	and call on the name of the LORD.
c70306	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people.
c70307	Precious in the sight of the LORD [is] the death of His saints.
c70308	Truly,
c70309	O LORD,
c70310	I [am] Your servant;
c70311	I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant;
c70312	You have released my bonds.
c70313	I will offer to You a sacrifice of thanksgiving
c70314	and call on the name of the LORD.
c70315	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people,
c70316	in the courts of the LORD’s house,
c70317	in your midst,
c70318	O Jerusalem.
c70319	Hallelujah!
c70320	Praise the LORD,
c70321	all you nations!
c70322	Extol Him,
c70323	all you peoples!
c70324	For great is His loving devotion to us,
c70325	and the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever.
c70326	Hallelujah!
c70327	Give thanks to the LORD,
c70328	for He is good;
c70329	His loving devotion endures forever.
c70330	Let Israel say,
c70331	“His loving devotion endures forever.”
c70332	Let the house of Aaron say,
c70333	“His loving devotion endures forever.”
c70334	Let those who fear the LORD say,
c70335	“His loving devotion endures forever.”
c70336	In [my] distress I called to the LORD,
c70337	[and He] answered [and set me] free.
c70338	The LORD is with me;
c70339	I will not be afraid.
c70340	What can man do to me?
c70341	The LORD is with me; He is my helper.
c70342	Therefore I will look in triumph on those who hate me.
c70343	It is better
c70344	to take refuge in the LORD
c70345	than to trust in man.
c70346	It is better
c70347	to take refuge in the LORD
c70348	than to trust in princes.
c70349	All the nations surrounded me;
c70350	in the name of the LORD
c70351	I will surely cut them off.
c70352	They surrounded me,
c70353	yes, they surrounded me;
c70354	in the name of the LORD
c70355	I will surely cut them off.
c70356	They swarmed around me like bees;
c70357	they were extinguished like a fire of thorns;
c70358	in the name of the LORD
c70359	I will surely cut them off.
c70360	I was pushed so hard
c70361	I was falling,
c70362	but the LORD helped me.
c70363	The LORD is my strength and my song,
c70364	and He has become my salvation.
c70365	Shouts of joy and salvation [resound] in the tents of the righteous:
c70366	“The right hand of the LORD performs with valor!
c70367	The right hand of the LORD is exalted!
c70368	The right hand of the LORD performs with valor!”
c70369	I will not die,
c70370	but I will live
c70371	and proclaim what the LORD has done.
c70372	The LORD disciplined me severely,
c70373	but He has not given me over to death.
c70374	Open to me the gates of righteousness;
c70375	I will enter
c70376	and give thanks to the LORD.
c70377	This is the gate of the LORD;
c70378	the righteous shall enter through it.
c70379	I will give You thanks,
c70380	for You have answered me,
c70381	and You have become my salvation.
c70382	The stone
c70383	the builders rejected
c70384	has become the cornerstone.
c70385	This is from the LORD,
c70386	[and] it [is] marvelous in our eyes.
c70387	This is the day
c70388	[that] the LORD has made;
c70389	we will rejoice
c70390	and be glad in it.
c70391	we pray.
c70392	O LORD,
c70393	save us, ... We beseech You,
c70395	O LORD,
c70396	cause us to prosper!
c70397	Blessed [is]
c70398	he who comes in the name of the LORD.
c70399	From the house of the LORD we bless you.
c70400	The LORD is God
c70401	and has made His light shine upon us.
c70402	Bind the festival sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar.
c70403	You are my God,
c70404	and I will give You thanks.
c70405	You are my God,
c70406	[and] I will exalt You.
c70407	Give thanks to the LORD,
c70408	for He is good;
c70409	His loving devotion endures forever.
c70410	Blessed [are] those whose way is blameless,
c70411	who walk in the law of the LORD.
c70412	Blessed
c70413	are those who keep His testimonies,
c70414	and seek Him with all their heart.
c70415	They do no iniquity;
c70416	they walk in His ways.
c70417	You have ordained Your precepts,
c70418	that we should keep them diligently.
c70419	Oh, that my ways were committed
c70420	to keeping Your statutes!
c70421	Then I would not be ashamed
c70422	when I consider all Your commandments.
c70423	I will praise You with an upright heart
c70424	when I learn Your righteous judgments.
c70425	I will keep Your statutes;
c70426	do not utterly forsake me.
c70427	How can a young man keep his way pure?
c70428	By guarding it according to Your word.
c70429	With all my heart I have sought You;
c70430	do not let me stray from Your commandments.
c70431	I have hidden Your word in my heart
c70432	that I might not sin against You.
c70433	Blessed are You,
c70434	O LORD;
c70435	teach me Your statutes.
c70436	With my lips I proclaim all the judgments of Your mouth.
c70437	I rejoice in the way of Your testimonies as much as in all riches.
c70438	I will meditate on Your precepts
c70439	and regard Your ways.
c70440	I will delight in Your statutes;
c70441	I will not forget Your word.
c70442	Deal bountifully with Your servant,
c70443	that I may live
c70444	and keep Your word.
c70445	Open my eyes
c70446	that I may see wondrous things from Your law.
c70447	I am a stranger on the earth;
c70448	do not hide Your commandments from me.
c70449	My soul is consumed with longing for Your judgments at all times.
c70450	You rebuke the arrogant— the cursed
c70451	who stray from Your commandments.
c70452	Remove my scorn and contempt,
c70453	for I have kept Your testimonies.
c70454	Though rulers sit
c70455	and slander me,
c70456	Your servant meditates on Your statutes;
c70457	Your testimonies are indeed my delight;
c70458	[they are] my counselors.
c70459	My soul cleaves to the dust;
c70460	revive me according to Your word.
c70461	I recounted my ways
c70462	and You answered me;
c70463	teach me Your statutes.
c70464	Make clear to me the way of Your precepts;
c70465	then I will meditate on Your wonders.
c70466	My soul melts with sorrow;
c70467	strengthen me according to Your word.
c70468	Remove me from the path of deceit
c70469	and graciously grant me Your law.
c70470	I have chosen the way of truth;
c70471	I have set Your ordinances {before me}.
c70472	I cling to Your testimonies,
c70473	O LORD;
c70474	let me not be put to shame.
c70475	I run in the path of Your commandments,
c70476	for You will enlarge my heart.
c70477	Teach me,
c70478	O LORD,
c70479	the way of Your statutes,
c70480	and I will keep [them] to the end.
c70481	Give me understanding
c70482	that I may observe Your law,
c70483	and follow it with all my heart.
c70484	Direct me in the path of Your commandments,
c70485	for there I find delight.
c70486	Turn my heart to Your testimonies
c70487	and not to covetous gain.
c70488	Turn my eyes
c70489	[away] from worthless things;
c70490	revive me with Your word.
c70491	Establish Your word to Your servant,
c70492	to produce reverence for You.
c70493	Turn away the disgrace
c70494	I dread,
c70495	for Your judgments are good.
c70496	How I long for Your precepts!
c70497	Revive me in Your righteousness.
c70498	May Your loving devotion come to me,
c70499	O LORD,
c70500	Your salvation, according to Your promise.
c70501	Then I can answer him who taunts, ... in Your word.
c70502	for I trust
c70503	Never snatch the word of truth from my mouth,
c70504	for I hope in Your judgments.
c70505	I will always obey Your law, forever and ever.
c70506	And I will walk in freedom,
c70507	for I have sought Your precepts.
c70508	I will speak of Your testimonies before kings,
c70509	and I will not be ashamed.
c70510	I delight in Your commandments
c70511	because I love them.
c70512	I lift up my hands to Your commandments,
c70513	which I love,
c70514	and I meditate on Your statutes.
c70515	Remember Your word to Your servant,
c70516	upon which You have given me hope.
c70517	This is my comfort in affliction,
c70518	that Your promise has given me life.
c70519	The arrogant utterly deride me,
c70520	but I do not turn from Your law.
c70521	I remember Your judgments of old,
c70522	O LORD,
c70523	and in them I find comfort.
c70524	Rage has taken hold of me because of the wicked
c70525	who reject Your law.
c70526	Your statutes are songs to me in the house of my pilgrimage.
c70527	In the night, ... I remember Your name,
c70528	O LORD,
c70529	and I will keep Your law.
c70530	This is my practice,
c70531	for I obey Your precepts.
c70532	The LORD is my portion;
c70533	I have promised
c70534	to keep Your words.
c70535	I have sought Your face with all my heart;
c70536	be gracious to me according to Your promise.
c70537	I considered my ways
c70538	and turned my steps to Your testimonies.
c70539	I hurried
c70540	without hesitating
c70541	to keep Your commandments.
c70542	Though the ropes of the wicked bind me,
c70543	I do not forget Your law.
c70544	At midnight I rise
c70545	to give You thanks for Your righteous judgments.
c70546	I am a friend to all
c70547	who fear You,
c70548	and to those who keep Your precepts.
c70549	with Your loving devotion,
c70550	O LORD;
c70551	The earth is filled
c70552	teach me Your statutes.
c70553	You are good to Your servant,
c70554	O LORD,
c70555	according to Your word.
c70556	Teach me good judgment and knowledge,
c70557	for I believe in Your commandments.
c70558	Before I was afflicted,
c70559	I went astray;
c70560	but now I keep Your word.
c70561	You are good,
c70562	and You do what is good;
c70563	teach me Your statutes.
c70564	Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies,
c70565	I will keep Your precepts with all my heart.
c70566	Their hearts are hard and callous,
c70567	but I delight in Your law.
c70568	It was good
c70569	for me to be afflicted,
c70570	that I might learn Your statutes.
c70571	The law from Your mouth is more precious to me than thousands [of pieces] of gold and silver.
c70572	Your hands have made me
c70573	and fashioned me;
c70574	give me understanding
c70575	to learn Your commandments.
c70576	May those who fear You see me
c70577	and rejoice,
c70578	for I have hoped in Your word.
c70579	I know,
c70580	O LORD,
c70581	that Your judgments are righteous,
c70582	and that in faithfulness You have afflicted me.
c70583	May Your loving devotion ... I pray,
c70584	comfort me,
c70585	according to Your promise to Your servant.
c70586	May Your compassion come to me,
c70587	that I may live,
c70588	for Your law [is] my delight.
c70589	May the arrogant be put to shame
c70590	for subverting me with a lie;
c70591	I will meditate on Your precepts.
c70592	May those who fear You turn to me,
c70593	those who know Your testimonies.
c70594	May my heart be blameless in Your statutes,
c70595	that I may not be put to shame.
c70596	My soul faints for Your salvation;
c70597	I wait for Your word.
c70598	My eyes fail, looking for Your promise;
c70599	I ask,
c70600	“When will You comfort me?”
c70601	Though I am like a wineskin dried by smoke,
c70602	I do not forget Your statutes.
c70603	How many days must Your servant wait?
c70604	When will You execute judgment on my persecutors?
c70605	The arrogant have dug pits for me
c70606	in violation of Your law.
c70607	All Your commandments [are] faithful;
c70608	I am persecuted without cause—
c70609	help me!
c70610	They almost wiped me from the earth,
c70611	but I have not forsaken Your precepts.
c70612	Revive me according to Your loving devotion,
c70613	and I will obey the testimony of Your mouth.
c70614	[is] everlasting;
c70615	O LORD,
c70616	Your word, ... it is firmly fixed in the heavens.
c70617	Your faithfulness [continues] through all generations;
c70618	You established the earth,
c70619	and it endures.
c70620	They stand this day according to Your ordinances,
c70621	for all things are servants to You.
c70622	If Your law had not been my delight,
c70623	then I would have perished in my affliction.
c70624	I will never forget Your precepts,
c70625	for by them You have revived me.
c70626	I am Yours;
c70627	save me,
c70628	for I have sought Your precepts.
c70629	The wicked wait
c70630	to destroy me,
c70631	but I will ponder Your testimonies.
c70632	I have seen an end to all perfection,
c70633	but Your commandment is without limit.
c70634	Oh, how I love Your law!
c70635	All day long it is my meditation.
c70636	Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies,
c70637	for they are always with me.
c70638	I have more insight than all my teachers,
c70639	for Your testimonies are my meditation.
c70640	I discern more than the elders,
c70641	because I obey Your precepts.
c70642	I have kept my feet from every evil path,
c70643	that I may keep Your word.
c70644	I have not departed from Your ordinances,
c70645	for You Yourself have taught me.
c70646	How sweet are Your words to my taste,
c70647	[sweeter than] honey in my mouth.
c70648	I gain understanding from Your precepts;
c70649	therefore I hate every false way.
c70650	Your word is a lamp to my feet
c70651	and a light to my path.
c70652	I have sworn
c70653	and confirmed
c70654	that I will keep Your righteous judgments.
c70655	I am severely afflicted,
c70656	O LORD;
c70657	revive me through Your word.
c70658	Accept the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
c70659	LORD,
c70660	and teach me Your judgments.
c70661	I constantly [take] my life in my hands,
c70662	yet I do not forget Your law.
c70663	The wicked have set a snare for me,
c70664	but I have not wandered from Your precepts.
c70665	Your testimonies are my heritage forever,
c70666	for they are the joy of my heart.
c70667	I have inclined my heart
c70668	to perform Your statutes, even to the very end.
c70669	The double-minded I despise,
c70670	but Your law I love.
c70671	You [are] my hiding place and my shield;
c70672	I put my hope in Your word.
c70673	Depart from me,
c70674	you evildoers,
c70675	that I may obey the commandments of my God.
c70676	Sustain me as You promised,
c70677	that I may live;
c70678	let me not be ashamed of my hope.
c70679	Uphold me,
c70680	and I will be delivered,
c70681	that I may always regard Your statutes.
c70682	You reject all
c70683	who stray from Your statutes,
c70684	for their deceitfulness is in vain.
c70685	All the wicked on earth You discard like dross;
c70686	therefore I love Your testimonies.
c70687	My flesh trembles in awe of You;
c70688	I stand in fear of Your judgments.
c70689	I have done what is just and right;
c70690	do not leave me to my oppressors.
c70691	Ensure Your servant’s well-being;
c70692	do not let the arrogant oppress me.
c70693	My eyes fail, looking for Your salvation, [and] for Your righteous promise.
c70694	Deal with Your servant according to Your loving devotion,
c70695	and teach me Your statutes.
c70696	I am Your servant;
c70697	give me understanding
c70698	that I may know Your testimonies.
c70699	It is time
c70700	to act,
c70701	for the LORD
c70702	[for] they have broken Your law.
c70703	Therefore I love Your commandments more than gold, even the purest gold.
c70704	Therefore I admire all Your precepts
c70705	and hate every false way.
c70706	Wonderful are Your testimonies;
c70707	therefore I obey them.
c70708	The unfolding of Your words gives light;
c70709	it informs the simple.
c70710	I open my mouth
c70711	and pant,
c70712	as I long for Your commandments.
c70713	Turn to me
c70714	and show me mercy, as You do to those who love Your name.
c70715	Establish my steps through Your promise;
c70716	let no sin rule over me.
c70717	Redeem me from the oppression of man,
c70718	that I may keep Your precepts.
c70719	Make Your face shine upon Your servant,
c70720	and teach me Your statutes.
c70721	My eyes shed streams of tears
c70722	because Your law is not obeyed.
c70723	Righteous are You,
c70724	O LORD,
c70725	and upright are Your judgments.
c70726	The testimonies You have laid down are righteous and altogether faithful.
c70727	My zeal has consumed me
c70728	because my foes forget Your words.
c70729	Your promise is completely pure;
c70730	therefore Your servant loves it.
c70731	I am lowly
c70732	and despised,
c70733	but I do not forget Your precepts.
c70734	Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
c70735	and Your law is true.
c70736	Trouble and distress have found me,
c70737	but Your commandments are my delight.
c70738	Your testimonies are righteous forever.
c70739	Give me understanding,
c70740	that I may live.
c70741	I call with all my heart;
c70742	answer me,
c70743	O LORD!
c70744	I will obey Your statutes.
c70745	I call to You;
c70746	save me,
c70747	that I may keep Your testimonies.
c70748	I rise before dawn
c70749	and cry for help;
c70750	in Your word I have put my hope.
c70751	My eyes anticipate the watches of night,
c70752	that I may meditate on Your word.
c70753	Hear my voice, ... according to Your loving devotion;
c70754	O LORD,
c70755	give me life according to Your justice.
c70756	Those who follow after wickedness draw near;
c70757	they are far from Your law.
c70758	You are near,
c70759	O LORD,
c70760	and all Your commandments are true.
c70761	Long ago I learned from Your testimonies
c70762	that You have established them forever.
c70763	Look upon my affliction
c70764	and rescue me,
c70765	for I have not forgotten Your law.
c70766	Defend my cause
c70767	and redeem me;
c70768	revive me according to Your word.
c70769	Salvation is far from the wicked
c70770	because they do not seek Your statutes.
c70771	Great are Your mercies,
c70772	O LORD;
c70773	revive me according to Your ordinances.
c70774	[Though] my persecutors and foes are many,
c70775	I have not turned from Your testimonies.
c70776	I look on the faithless
c70777	with loathing
c70778	because they do not keep Your word.
c70779	Consider
c70780	how I love Your precepts,
c70781	O LORD;
c70782	give me life according to Your loving devotion.
c70783	Your word is the essence of truth,
c70784	and all Your righteous judgments endure.
c70785	Rulers persecute me without cause,
c70786	but my heart fears only Your word.
c70787	I rejoice in Your promise
c70788	like one who finds great spoil.
c70789	I hate ... falsehood,
c70790	and abhor
c70791	[but] Your law I love.
c70792	Seven times a day I praise You for Your righteous judgments.
c70793	Abundant peace belongs to those who love Your instruction;
c70794	nothing can make them stumble.
c70795	I wait for Your salvation,
c70796	O LORD,
c70797	and I carry out Your commandments.
c70798	I obey Your testimonies
c70799	and love them greatly.
c70800	I obey Your precepts and Your testimonies,
c70801	for all my ways are before You.
c70802	May my cry come before You,
c70803	O LORD;
c70804	give me understanding according to Your word.
c70805	May my plea come before You;
c70806	rescue me according to Your promise.
c70807	My lips pour forth praise,
c70808	for You teach me Your statutes.
c70809	My tongue sings of Your word,
c70810	for all Your commandments are righteous.
c70811	May Your hand be ready
c70812	to help me,
c70813	for I have chosen Your precepts.
c70814	I long for Your salvation,
c70815	O LORD,
c70816	and Your law is my delight.
c70817	Let me live
c70818	to praise You;
c70819	may Your judgments sustain me.
c70820	I have strayed like a lost sheep;
c70821	seek Your servant,
c70822	for I have not forgotten Your commandments.
c70823	A Song of Ascents.
c70824	In my distress I cried to the LORD,
c70825	and He answered me.
c70826	O LORD,
c70827	Deliver my soul, ... from lying lips
c70828	and a deceitful tongue.
c70829	What will He do to you,
c70830	and what will be added to you,
c70831	O deceitful tongue?
c70832	arrows from the warrior,
c70833	Sharp
c70834	with burning coals of juniper!
c70835	Woe to me
c70836	that I dwell in Meshech,
c70837	that I live among the tents of Kedar!
c70838	Too long have I dwelt among those who hate peace.
c70839	I [am in favor of] peace;
c70841	but when I speak,
c70842	they [want] war.
c70843	A Song of Ascents.
c70844	I lift up my eyes to the hills.
c70845	From where does my help come?
c70846	My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
c70847	He will not allow your foot to slip;
c70848	your Protector will not slumber.
c70849	Behold, ... will not slumber
c70850	the Protector of Israel ... or sleep.
c70851	The LORD [is] your keeper;
c70852	the LORD [is] the shade on your right hand.
c70853	The sun will not strike you by day
c70854	nor the moon by night.
c70855	The LORD will guard you from all evil;
c70856	He will preserve your soul.
c70857	The LORD will watch over
c70858	and going,
c70859	your coming
c70860	both now and forevermore.
c70861	A Song of Ascents.
c70862	Of David.
c70863	I was glad
c70864	when they said to me,
c70865	“Let us go to the house of the LORD.”
c70866	Our feet are standing in your gates,
c70867	O Jerusalem.
c70868	Jerusalem
c70869	is built up as a city
c70870	united together,
c70871	where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD,
c70872	as a testimony for Israel,
c70873	to give thanks to the name of the LORD.
c70874	For there the thrones of judgment stand,
c70875	the thrones of the house of David.
c70876	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
c70877	“May those who love you prosper.
c70878	May there be peace within your walls,
c70879	[and] prosperity inside your fortresses.”
c70880	For the sake of my brothers and friends, I will say,
c70881	“Peace [be] within you.”
c70882	For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your prosperity.
c70883	A Song of Ascents.
c70884	I lift up my eyes to You,
c70885	the One enthroned in heaven.
c70887	As the eyes of servants [look] to the hand of their master,
c70888	as the eyes of a maidservant [look] to the hand of her mistress,
c70889	so our eyes are on the LORD our God
c70890	until He shows us mercy.
c70891	Have mercy on us,
c70892	O LORD,
c70893	have mercy,
c70894	for we have endured much contempt.
c70895	We have endured much scorn from the arrogant,
c70896	much contempt from the proud.
c70897	A Song of Ascents.
c70898	Of David.
c70899	If the LORD had not
c70900	been on our side—
c70901	let Israel now declare—
c70902	if the LORD had not
c70903	been on our side
c70904	when men attacked us,
c70905	then they would have swallowed us alive,
c70906	when their anger flared against us,
c70907	then the floods would have engulfed us,
c70908	the torrent would have overwhelmed us,
c70909	then the raging waters would have swept us away.
c70910	Blessed [be] the LORD,
c70911	who has not given us as prey to their teeth.
c70912	We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler;
c70913	the net is torn,
c70914	and we have slipped away.
c70915	Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
c70916	A Song of Ascents.
c70917	Those who trust in the LORD
c70918	are like Mount Zion.
c70919	It cannot be moved;
c70920	it abides forever.
c70921	Jerusalem,
c70922	As the mountains surround
c70923	so the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forevermore.
c70924	For the scepter of the wicked will not rest upon the land allotted to the righteous,
c70925	so that the righteous will not put forth their hands to injustice.
c70926	Do good,
c70927	O LORD,
c70928	to [those who are] good, and to the upright in heart.
c70929	But those who turn aside to crooked ways,
c70930	the LORD will banish with the evildoers.
c70931	Peace be upon Israel.
c70932	A Song of Ascents.
c70933	When the LORD restored the captives of Zion,
c70934	we were like dreamers.
c70935	Then our mouths were filled with laughter
c70936	and our tongues with shouts of joy.
c70937	Then it was proclaimed among the nations,
c70938	“The LORD ... great
c70939	has done ... things for them.”
c70940	The LORD ... great
c70941	has done ... things for us;
c70942	we are filled with joy.
c70943	Restore
c70944	O LORD,
c70945	our captives, ... like streams in the Negev.
c70946	Those who sow in tears
c70947	will reap with shouts of joy.
c70948	He who goes out
c70949	weeping,
c70950	bearing a trail of seed,
c70951	will surely return with shouts of joy,
c70952	carrying sheaves [of grain].
c70953	A Song of Ascents.
c70954	Of Solomon.
c70955	Unless the LORD builds the house,
c70956	its builders labor in vain;
c70957	unless the LORD protects the city,
c70958	its watchmen stand guard in vain.
c70959	In vain you
c70960	early
c70961	rise
c70962	late,
c70963	and stay up
c70964	toiling for bread to eat—
c70965	for He gives sleep to His beloved.
c70966	Children are indeed a heritage from the LORD,
c70967	[and] the fruit of the womb [is His] reward.
c70968	Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,
c70969	so [are] children [born in] one’s youth.
c70970	Blessed is the man
c70971	whose quiver is full of them.
c70972	He will not be put to shame
c70973	when he confronts the enemies at the gate.
c70974	A Song of Ascents.
c70975	Blessed are all who fear the LORD,
c70976	who walk in His ways!
c70977	the fruit of your labor,
c70978	For when you eat
c70979	blessings
c70980	and prosperity will be yours.
c70981	Your wife will be like a fruitful vine [flourishing] within your house,
c70982	your sons like olive shoots [sitting] around your table.
c70983	indeed
c70984	In this way ... shall blessing come to the man
c70985	who fears the LORD.
c70986	May the LORD bless you from Zion,
c70987	that you may see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life,
c70988	that you may see your children’s children!
c70989	Peace be upon Israel.
c70990	A Song of Ascents.
c70991	Many a time they have persecuted me from my youth—
c70992	let Israel now declare—
c70993	many a time they have persecuted me from my youth,
c70994	but they have not prevailed against me.
c70995	The plowmen plowed over my back;
c70996	they made their furrows long.
c70997	The LORD is righteous;
c70998	He has cut me from the cords of the wicked.
c70999	in shame.
c71000	May all who hate Zion be turned back
c71001	May they be like grass on the rooftops,
c71002	before it can grow,
c71003	which withers
c71004	unable to fill the hands of the reaper,
c71005	or the arms of the one who binds sheaves.
c71006	May none who pass by say [to them],
c71007	“The blessing of the LORD be on you.
c71008	We bless you in the name of the LORD.”
c71009	A Song of Ascents.
c71010	Out of the depths I cry to You,
c71011	O LORD!
c71012	O LORD,
c71013	hear my voice;
c71014	let Your ears be attentive to my plea for mercy.
c71015	If You, ... kept track of iniquities,
c71016	O LORD,
c71017	O Lord,
c71018	who could stand?
c71019	But with You there is forgiveness,
c71020	that You may be feared.
c71021	I wait for the LORD;
c71022	my soul does wait,
c71023	and in His word I put my hope.
c71024	My soul [waits] for the Lord
c71025	more than watchmen for the morning—
c71026	more than watchmen waiting for the morning.
c71027	put your hope
c71028	O Israel,
c71029	in the LORD,
c71030	for with the LORD is loving devotion,
c71031	and with Him is redemption in abundance.
c71032	And He will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.
c71033	A Song of Ascents.
c71034	Of David.
c71035	O LORD,
c71036	My heart is not proud,
c71037	my eyes are not haughty.
c71038	I do not aspire to great matters or things too lofty for me.
c71039	Surely I have stilled
c71040	and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with his mother,
c71041	like a weaned child is my soul within me.
c71042	put your hope
c71043	O Israel,
c71044	in the LORD, both now and forevermore.
c71045	A Song of Ascents.
c71046	remember
c71047	O LORD,
c71048	on behalf of David all the hardships he endured,
c71049	how he swore an oath to the LORD,
c71050	[and] vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
c71051	“I will not enter my house
c71052	or get into my bed,
c71053	I will not give sleep to my eyes
c71054	[or] slumber to my eyelids,
c71055	until I find a place for the LORD,
c71056	a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
c71057	We heard [the ark] was in Ephrathah;
c71058	we found it in the fields of Jaar.
c71059	Let us go to His dwelling place;
c71060	let us worship at His footstool.
c71061	Arise,
c71062	O LORD,
c71063	to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.
c71064	May Your priests be clothed with righteousness,
c71065	and Your saints shout for joy.
c71066	For the sake of Your servant David, do not reject Your anointed one.
c71067	The LORD swore an oath to David,
c71068	a promise He will not revoke
c71069	:“One of your descendants I will set upon your throne.
c71070	If your sons keep My covenant and the testimony
c71071	I will teach them,
c71072	then their sons will also sit on your throne forever and ever.”
c71073	For the LORD has chosen Zion;
c71074	He has desired it for His home:
c71075	“This is My resting place forever and ever;
c71076	here I will dwell,
c71077	for I have desired [this home].
c71078	I will bless her with abundant provisions;
c71079	I will satisfy her poor with bread.
c71080	I will clothe her priests with salvation,
c71081	and her saints will sing out in joy.
c71082	There I will make a horn grow for David;
c71083	I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.
c71084	I will clothe his enemies with shame,
c71085	but the crown upon him will gleam.”
c71086	A Song of Ascents.
c71087	Of David.
c71088	Behold,
c71089	how good
c71090	and how pleasant it is
c71091	when brothers live in harmony!
c71092	It is like fine oil on the head,
c71093	running down on the beard, ... Aaron’s beard
c71094	running down ... over the collar of his robes.
c71095	It is like the dew of Hermon
c71096	falling on the mountains of Zion.
c71097	For there the LORD has bestowed the blessing
c71098	of life forevermore.
c71099	A Song of Ascents.
c71100	Come, bless the LORD,
c71101	all you servants of the LORD
c71102	who serve by night in the house of the LORD!
c71103	Lift up your hands to the sanctuary
c71104	and bless the LORD!
c71105	May the LORD, ... bless you from Zion.
c71106	the Maker of heaven and earth,
c71107	Hallelujah!
c71108	Praise the name of the LORD.
c71109	Give praise,
c71110	O servants of the LORD,
c71111	who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.
c71112	Praise the LORD,
c71113	for the LORD is good;
c71114	sing praises to His name,
c71115	for it is lovely.
c71116	For the LORD has chosen Jacob as His own,
c71117	Israel as His treasured possession.
c71118	For I know
c71119	that the LORD is great;
c71120	our Lord is above all gods.
c71121	whatever
c71122	The LORD ... pleases Him
c71123	does ... in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all their depths.
c71124	He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth.
c71125	He sends lightning with the rain
c71126	and brings the wind from His storehouses.
c71127	He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, of both man and beast.
c71128	He sent signs and wonders into your midst,
c71129	O Egypt,
c71130	against Pharaoh and all his servants.
c71131	He struck down many nations
c71132	and slaughtered mighty kings:
c71133	Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan.
c71134	He gave their land as an inheritance,
c71135	a heritage to His people Israel.
c71136	O LORD,
c71137	Your name, ... endures forever,
c71138	O LORD,
c71139	Your renown, ... through all generations.
c71140	For the LORD will vindicate His people
c71141	and will have compassion on His servants.
c71142	The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
c71143	made by the hands of men.
c71144	They have mouths
c71145	but cannot speak,
c71146	eyes
c71147	but cannot see.
c71148	They have ears
c71149	but cannot hear,
c71150	nor is there breath in their mouths.
c71151	Those who make them will be like them,
c71152	as will all
c71153	who trust in them.
c71154	O house of Israel,
c71155	praise the LORD;
c71156	O house of Aaron,
c71157	praise the LORD;
c71158	O house of Levi,
c71159	praise the LORD;
c71160	you who fear the LORD,
c71161	praise the LORD!
c71162	Blessed be the LORD from Zion—
c71163	He who dwells in Jerusalem.
c71164	Hallelujah!
c71165	Give thanks to the LORD,
c71166	for He is good.
c71167	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71168	Give thanks to the God of gods.
c71169	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71170	Give thanks to the Lord of lords.
c71171	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71172	He alone does great wonders.
c71173	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71174	By His insight He made the heavens.
c71175	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71176	He spread out the earth upon the waters.
c71177	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71178	He made the great lights—
c71179	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71180	the sun to rule the day,
c71181	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71182	the moon and stars to govern the night.
c71183	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71184	He struck down the firstborn of Egypt
c71185	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71186	and brought Israel out from among them
c71187	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71188	with a mighty hand and outstretched arm.
c71189	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71190	He divided the Red Sea in two
c71191	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71192	and led Israel through the midst,
c71193	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71194	but swept Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea.
c71195	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71196	He led His people through the wilderness.
c71197	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71198	He struck down great kings
c71199	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71200	and slaughtered mighty kings—
c71201	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71202	Sihon king of the Amorites
c71203	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71204	and Og king of Bashan—
c71205	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71206	and gave their land as an inheritance,
c71207	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71208	a heritage to His servant Israel.
c71209	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71210	He remembered us in our low estate
c71211	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71212	and rescued us from our foes.
c71213	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71214	He gives food to every creature.
c71215	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71216	Give thanks to the God of heaven!
c71217	His loving devotion endures forever.
c71218	By the rivers of Babylon
c71219	we sat
c71220	and wept
c71221	when we remembered Zion.
c71222	There on the poplars we hung our harps,
c71223	for there our captors requested a song,
c71224	and our tormentors demanded songs of joy:
c71225	“Sing us a song of Zion.”
c71226	How can we sing a song of the LORD in a foreign land?
c71227	If I forget you,
c71228	O Jerusalem,
c71229	may my right hand cease to function.
c71230	May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth
c71231	if I do not remember you,
c71232	if I do not exalt Jerusalem as my greatest joy!
c71233	Remember,
c71234	O LORD,
c71235	the sons of Edom on the day Jerusalem [fell]:
c71236	they said,
c71237	“Destroy it,”
c71238	“tear it down to its foundations!”
c71239	O Daughter Babylon,
c71240	doomed to destruction,
c71241	blessed
c71242	is he who repays you as
c71243	you have done to us.
c71244	Blessed is
c71245	he who seizes
c71246	your infants and dashes them against the rocks.
c71247	Of David.
c71248	I will give You thanks with all my heart;
c71249	before the heavenly beings I will sing Your praises.
c71250	I will bow down toward Your holy temple
c71251	and give thanks to Your name for Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness;
c71252	You have exalted Your name and Your word above all else.
c71253	On the day I called,
c71254	You answered me;
c71255	You made me bold [and] strengthened my soul.
c71256	will give You thanks,
c71257	O LORD,
c71258	All the kings of the earth
c71259	when they hear the words of Your mouth.
c71260	They will sing of the ways of the LORD,
c71261	for the glory of the LORD is great.
c71262	Though the LORD is on high,
c71263	He attends to the lowly;
c71264	but the proud He knows from afar.
c71265	If I walk in the midst of trouble,
c71266	You preserve me
c71267	from the anger of my foes; You will extend Your hand,
c71268	and Your right hand will save me.
c71269	The LORD will fulfill [His purpose] in me.
c71270	O LORD,
c71271	Your loving devotion endures forever—
c71272	do not abandon the works of Your hands.
c71273	For the choirmaster.
c71274	of David.
c71275	A Psalm
c71276	O LORD,
c71277	You have searched me
c71278	and known me.
c71279	You know
c71280	when I sit
c71281	and when I rise;
c71282	You understand my thoughts from afar.
c71283	my path
c71284	and my lying down;
c71285	You search out
c71286	You are aware of all my ways.
c71287	Even before a word is on my tongue,
c71289	O LORD.
c71290	You know all about it,
c71291	You hem me in behind and before;
c71292	You have laid Your hand upon me.
c71293	[Such] knowledge [is] too wonderful for me,
c71294	too lofty
c71295	for me to attain.
c71296	Where can I go to escape Your Spirit?
c71297	Where can I flee from Your presence?
c71298	If I ascend to the heavens,
c71299	You are there;
c71300	if I make my bed in Sheol,
c71301	You are there.
c71302	If I rise on the wings of the dawn,
c71303	if I settle by the farthest sea,
c71304	even there Your hand will guide me;
c71305	Your right hand will hold me fast.
c71306	If I say,
c71307	“Surely the darkness will hide me,
c71308	and the light become night around me”—
c71309	even the darkness is not dark to You,
c71310	but the night shines like the day,
c71311	for darkness is as light to You.
c71312	For You formed my inmost being;
c71313	You knit me together in my mother’s womb.
c71314	I will praise
c71315	You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
c71316	Marvelous [are] Your works,
c71317	and I know this very well.
c71318	My frame was not hidden from You
c71319	when I was made in secret,
c71320	when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
c71321	Your eyes saw my unformed body;
c71322	all ... were written in Your book
c71323	my days
c71324	and ordained for me
c71325	before one of them came to be.
c71328	How precious to me are Your thoughts,
c71329	O God,
c71330	how vast is their sum!
c71331	[If] I were to count them,
c71332	they would outnumber the grains of sand;
c71333	when I awake,
c71334	I am still with You.
c71335	O ... that You would slay
c71336	God,
c71337	the wicked—
c71338	you bloodthirsty men—
c71339	away from me,
c71340	who invoke You with deceit;
c71341	Your enemies take [Your name] in vain.
c71342	Do I not hate
c71343	O LORD,
c71344	those who hate You,
c71345	and detest those who rise against You?
c71346	I hate them with perfect hatred;
c71347	I count them as my enemies.
c71348	Search me,
c71349	O God,
c71350	and know my heart;
c71351	test
c71352	me and know my concerns.
c71353	See
c71354	if there is any offensive way in me;
c71355	lead me in the way everlasting.
c71356	For the choirmaster.
c71357	A Psalm of David.
c71358	Rescue me,
c71359	O LORD,
c71360	from evil men.
c71361	Protect me from men of violence,
c71362	who devise evil in their hearts
c71363	and stir up war all day long.
c71364	They make their tongues as sharp as serpents;
c71365	the venom of vipers is on their lips.
c71366	Selah
c71367	Guard me,
c71368	O LORD,
c71369	from the hands of the wicked.
c71370	Keep me safe from men of violence
c71371	who scheme
c71372	to make me stumble.
c71373	The proud hide a snare for me;
c71374	the cords
c71375	of their net are spread along the path,
c71376	and lures are set out for me.
c71377	Selah
c71378	I say to the LORD,
c71379	“You are my God.”
c71380	Hear,
c71381	O LORD,
c71382	my cry for help.
c71383	O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
c71384	You shield my head in the day of battle.
c71385	Grant not,
c71386	O LORD,
c71387	the desires of the wicked;
c71388	do not promote their evil plans,
c71389	[lest] they be exalted.
c71390	Selah
c71391	May the heads of those who surround me
c71392	be covered in the trouble their lips have caused.
c71393	May burning coals fall on them;
c71394	may they be thrown into the fire,
c71395	into the miry pits,
c71396	never to rise again.
c71397	May no slanderer be established in the land.
c71398	May calamity ... the man of violence.
c71399	hunt down
c71400	I know
c71401	that the LORD upholds justice for the poor [and defends] the cause of the needy.
c71402	Surely the righteous will praise Your name;
c71403	the upright will dwell in Your presence.
c71404	A Psalm of David.
c71405	O LORD;
c71406	I call upon You,
c71407	come quickly to me.
c71408	Hear my voice
c71409	when I call to You.
c71410	May my prayer be set before You like incense,
c71411	my uplifted hands like the evening offering.
c71412	Set
c71413	O LORD,
c71414	a guard, ... over my mouth;
c71415	keep watch at the door of my lips.
c71416	Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing
c71417	or take part in works of wickedness with men
c71418	who do iniquity;
c71419	let me not feast on their delicacies.
c71420	Let the righteous man strike me;
c71421	be an act of loving devotion.
c71422	let his rebuke
c71423	It is oil for my head;
c71424	let me not refuse it.
c71425	For
c71426	my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked.
c71427	When their rulers are thrown from the cliffs,
c71428	the people will listen to my words,
c71429	for they are pleasant.
c71430	As when one plows
c71431	and breaks up the soil,
c71432	so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
c71433	But ... are fixed on You,
c71434	O GOD, the Lord.
c71435	my eyes
c71436	In You I seek refuge;
c71437	do not leave my soul {defenseless}.
c71438	Keep me from the snares
c71439	they have laid for me,
c71440	and from the lures of the evildoers.
c71441	Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
c71442	I
c71443	while ... pass by in safety.
c71444	A Maskil of David,
c71445	when he was in the cave.
c71446	A prayer.
c71447	I cry aloud to the LORD;
c71448	I lift my voice to the LORD for mercy.
c71449	I pour out my complaint before Him;
c71450	I reveal my trouble to Him.
c71451	Although my spirit grows faint within me,
c71452	You know my way.
c71453	Along the path
c71454	I travel
c71455	they have hidden a snare for me.
c71456	Look to my right
c71457	and see,
c71458	no one attends to me;
c71459	there is no refuge for me,
c71460	no one cares for my soul.
c71461	I cry to You,
c71462	O LORD:
c71464	“You [are] my refuge,
c71465	my portion in the land of the living.”
c71466	Listen to my cry,
c71467	for I am brought quite low.
c71468	Rescue me from my pursuers,
c71469	for they are too strong for me.
c71470	Free my soul from prison
c71471	that I may praise Your name.
c71472	The righteous will gather around me
c71473	because of Your goodness to me.
c71474	A Psalm of David.
c71475	O LORD,
c71476	hear my prayer.
c71477	In Your faithfulness, give ear to my plea;
c71478	in Your righteousness, answer me.
c71479	Do not bring Your servant into judgment,
c71480	for no one alive is righteous before You.
c71481	For the enemy has pursued my soul,
c71482	crushing my life to the ground,
c71483	making me dwell in darkness like those long since dead.
c71484	My spirit grows faint within me;
c71485	my heart is dismayed inside me.
c71486	I remember the days of old;
c71487	I meditate on all Your works;
c71488	I consider the work of Your hands.
c71489	I stretch out my hands to You;
c71490	my soul thirsts for you like a parched land.
c71491	Selah
c71492	me quickly,
c71493	Answer
c71494	O LORD;
c71495	my spirit fails.
c71496	Do not hide Your face from me,
c71497	or I will be like those who go down to the Pit.
c71498	Let me hear Your loving devotion in the morning,
c71499	for I have put my trust in You.
c71500	Teach me the way
c71501	I should walk,
c71502	for to You I lift up my soul.
c71503	Deliver me from my enemies,
c71504	O LORD;
c71505	I flee to You for refuge.
c71506	Teach
c71507	me to do Your will,
c71508	for You are my God.
c71509	May Your good Spirit
c71510	lead me on level ground.
c71511	For the sake of Your name,
c71512	O LORD,
c71513	revive me.
c71514	In Your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.
c71515	And in Your loving devotion, cut off my enemies.
c71516	Wipe out all who afflict me,
c71517	for I am Your servant.
c71518	Of David.
c71519	Blessed [be] the LORD, my rock,
c71520	who trains my hands for war,
c71521	my fingers for battle.
c71522	He is my loving devotion and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer.
c71523	He is my shield,
c71524	in whom I take refuge,
c71525	who subdues peoples under me.
c71526	O LORD,
c71527	what is man,
c71528	that You regard him,
c71529	the son of man that
c71530	You think of him?
c71531	Man is like a breath;
c71532	his days are like a passing shadow.
c71533	O LORD,
c71534	Part Your heavens,
c71535	and come down;
c71536	touch the mountains,
c71537	that they may smoke.
c71538	Flash forth Your lightning
c71539	and scatter them;
c71540	shoot Your arrows
c71541	and rout them.
c71542	Reach down from on high; ... from the grasp
c71543	rescue me
c71544	and deliver me from deep waters,
c71545	of foreigners,
c71546	whose mouths speak falsehood,
c71547	whose right hands are deceitful.
c71548	O God;
c71549	I will sing to You a new song,
c71550	on a harp of ten strings I will make music to You,
c71551	to the One who gives victory to kings,
c71552	who frees His servant David from the deadly sword.
c71553	Set me free
c71554	and rescue me from the grasp of foreigners,
c71555	whose mouths speak falsehood,
c71556	whose right hands are deceitful.
c71557	Then our sons will be like plants
c71558	nurtured in their youth,
c71559	our daughters like corner pillars
c71560	carved to adorn a palace.
c71561	Our storehouses will be full,
c71562	supplying all manner of produce;
c71563	our flocks will bring forth thousands,
c71564	tens of thousands in our fields.
c71565	Our oxen will bear great loads.
c71566	There will be no breach in the walls,
c71567	no going into captivity,
c71568	and no cry of lament in our streets.
c71569	Blessed are the people
c71570	of whom this is so;
c71571	blessed are the people
c71572	whose God is the LORD.
c71573	[A Psalm] of praise. Of David.
c71574	I will exalt You,
c71575	my God [and] King;
c71576	I will bless Your name forever and ever.
c71577	Every day I will bless You,
c71578	and I will praise Your name forever and ever.
c71579	Great [is] the LORD
c71580	and greatly to be praised;
c71581	His greatness [is] unsearchable.
c71582	One generation will commend Your works to the next,
c71583	and they shall proclaim Your mighty acts,
c71584	the glorious splendor of Your majesty. And I will meditate on Your wondrous works.
c71585	They will proclaim the power of Your awesome deeds,
c71586	Your greatness.
c71587	and I will declare
c71588	They will extol the fame of Your abundant goodness
c71589	and joyfully sing of Your righteousness.
c71590	The LORD is gracious and compassionate,
c71591	slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion.
c71592	The LORD is good to all;
c71593	His compassion rests on all He has made.
c71594	will give You thanks,
c71595	O LORD,
c71596	All You have made
c71597	and Your saints shall bless You.
c71598	They will tell of the glory of Your kingdom
c71599	and speak of Your might,
c71600	to make known to men Your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of Your kingdom.
c71601	Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, ... all
c71602	and Your dominion [endures] through ... generations. The LORD is faithful in all His words <p class=|indent2|>and kind in all His actions.
c71603	The LORD upholds all
c71604	who fall
c71605	and lifts up all
c71606	who are bowed down.
c71607	The eyes of all look to You,
c71608	and You give them their food in season.
c71609	You open Your hand
c71610	and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
c71611	The LORD is righteous in all His ways
c71612	and kind in all His deeds.
c71613	The LORD is near to all
c71614	who call on Him,
c71615	to all
c71616	who call out to Him in truth.
c71617	He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him;
c71618	He hears their cry
c71619	and saves them.
c71620	The LORD preserves all who love Him,
c71621	but all the wicked He will destroy.
c71622	My mouth will declare the praise of the LORD;
c71623	let every creature bless His holy name forever and ever.
c71624	Hallelujah!
c71625	Praise
c71626	O my soul.
c71627	the LORD,
c71628	I will praise the LORD all my life;
c71629	I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.
c71630	Put not your trust in princes,
c71631	in mortal man,
c71632	who cannot save.
c71633	When his spirit departs,
c71634	he returns to the ground;
c71635	on that very day his plans perish.
c71636	Blessed is he
c71637	whose help is the God of Jacob,
c71638	whose hope is in the LORD his God,
c71639	the Maker of heaven and earth,
c71640	the sea, and everything
c71641	in them.
c71642	He remains faithful forever,
c71643	executing justice for the oppressed,
c71644	giving food to the hungry.
c71645	The LORD sets the prisoners {free},
c71646	the LORD opens [the eyes of] the blind,
c71647	the LORD lifts those who are weighed down,
c71648	the LORD loves the righteous.
c71649	The LORD protects the sojourners;
c71650	He sustains the fatherless and the widow,
c71651	but the ways of the wicked He frustrates.
c71652	The LORD reigns forever,
c71653	your God,
c71654	O Zion,
c71655	for all generations.
c71656	Hallelujah!
c71657	Hallelujah!
c71658	How good [it is]
c71659	to sing praises to our God,
c71660	for ... is pleasant
c71661	praise ... and lovely.
c71662	The LORD builds up Jerusalem;
c71663	He gathers the exiles of Israel.
c71664	He heals the brokenhearted
c71665	and binds up their wounds.
c71666	He determines the number of the stars;
c71667	He calls them each by name.
c71668	Great [is] our Lord
c71669	and mighty in power;
c71670	His understanding has no limit.
c71671	The LORD sustains the afflicted,
c71672	[but] casts the wicked to the ground.
c71673	Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving;
c71674	make music on the harp to our God,
c71675	who covers the sky with clouds,
c71676	who prepares rain for the earth,
c71677	who makes grass to grow on the hills.
c71678	He provides food for the animals,
c71679	and for the young ravens
c71680	when they call.
c71681	He does not delight in the strength of the horse;
c71682	He takes no pleasure in the legpower of the man.
c71683	The LORD is pleased with those who fear Him,
c71684	who hope in His loving devotion.
c71685	Exalt
c71686	O Jerusalem;
c71687	the LORD,
c71688	praise your God,
c71689	O Zion!
c71690	For He strengthens the bars of your gates
c71691	and blesses the children within you.
c71692	He makes peace [at] your borders;
c71693	He fills you with the finest wheat.
c71694	He sends forth His command ... the earth;
c71695	to ... His word runs swiftly.
c71696	He spreads the snow like wool;
c71697	He scatters the frost like ashes;
c71698	He casts forth His hail like pebbles.
c71699	can withstand His icy blast?
c71700	Who
c71701	He sends forth His word
c71702	and melts them;
c71703	He unleashes His winds,
c71704	and the waters flow.
c71705	He declares His word to Jacob,
c71706	His statutes and judgments to Israel.
c71707	He has done this for no other nation;
c71708	His judgments.
c71709	they do not know
c71710	Hallelujah!
c71711	Hallelujah!
c71712	Praise the LORD from the heavens;
c71713	praise Him in the highest places.
c71714	Praise Him,
c71715	all His angels;
c71716	praise Him,
c71717	all His heavenly hosts.
c71718	Praise Him,
c71719	O sun and moon;
c71720	praise Him,
c71721	all you shining stars.
c71722	Praise Him,
c71723	O highest heavens, and you waters
c71724	above the skies.
c71725	Let them praise the name of the LORD,
c71726	for He gave the command
c71727	and they were created.
c71728	He established them forever and ever;
c71729	He issued a decree
c71730	that will never pass away.
c71731	Praise the LORD from the earth,
c71732	all great sea creatures and ocean depths,
c71733	lightning and hail, snow and clouds, powerful wind
c71734	fulfilling His word,
c71735	mountains and all hills,
c71736	fruit trees and all cedars,
c71737	wild animals and all cattle,
c71738	crawling creatures and flying birds,
c71739	kings of the earth and all peoples,
c71740	princes and all rulers of the earth,
c71741	young men and maidens,
c71742	old and young together.
c71743	Let them praise the name of the LORD,
c71744	for His name alone is exalted;
c71745	His splendor [is] above heaven and earth.
c71746	He has raised up a horn for His people,
c71747	the praise of all His saints, of Israel, a people near to Him.
c71748	Hallelujah!
c71749	Hallelujah!
c71750	Sing to the LORD a new song—
c71751	His praise in the assembly of the godly.
c71752	Let Israel rejoice in their Maker;
c71753	let the children of Zion rejoice in their King.
c71754	Let them praise His name with dancing,
c71755	and make music to Him with tambourine and harp.
c71756	For the LORD takes pleasure in His people;
c71757	He adorns the afflicted with salvation.
c71758	Let the saints exult in glory;
c71759	let them shout for joy upon their beds.
c71760	May the high praises of God be in their mouths,
c71761	and a two-edged sword in their hands,
c71762	to inflict vengeance on the nations
c71763	and punishment
c71764	on the peoples,
c71765	to bind their kings with chains,
c71766	and their nobles with shackles of iron,
c71767	to execute the judgment written [against them].
c71768	This honor is for all His saints.
c71769	Hallelujah!
c71770	Hallelujah!
c71771	Praise God in His sanctuary.
c71772	Praise Him in His mighty heavens.
c71773	Praise Him for His mighty acts;
c71774	praise Him for His excellent greatness.
c71775	Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet;
c71776	praise Him with the harp and lyre.
c71777	Praise Him with tambourine and dancing;
c71778	praise Him with the strings and flute.
c71779	Praise Him with clashing cymbals;
c71780	praise Him with resounding cymbals.
c71781	Let everything that has breath praise the LORD.
c71782	Hallelujah!
c71783	There once was a man in the land of Uz
c71784	whose name [was] Job.
c71785	And this man was blameless and upright, fearing God
c71786	and shunning evil.
c71787	He had seven sons and three daughters,
c71788	and he owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, ... Job was
c71789	and a very large number of servants.
c71790	the greatest man of all the people of the east.
c71791	[Job's] sons would take turns
c71792	holding feasts in their homes,
c71793	and they would invite
c71794	their three sisters
c71795	to eat
c71796	and drink with them.
c71797	And
c71798	when the days of feasting were over,
c71799	Job would send [for his children]
c71800	to purify them,
c71801	rising early in the morning
c71802	to offer burnt offerings for all of them.
c71803	For Job thought,
c71804	“Perhaps my children have sinned
c71805	and cursed God in their hearts.”
c71806	This was Job’s regular practice.
c71807	One day
c71808	the sons of God came
c71809	to present themselves before the LORD,
c71810	and Satan also came with them.
c71811	said the LORD to Satan.
c71812	“Where have you come from?”
c71813	he replied,
c71815	“From roaming through the earth,”
c71816	“and from walking back and forth in it.”
c71817	Then the LORD said to Satan,
c71818	“Have you considered My servant Job?
c71819	For [there is] no one on earth like him, a man
c71820	[who is] blameless and upright, who fears God
c71821	and shuns evil.”
c71822	Satan answered the LORD,
c71824	“Does Job fear God for nothing?
c71825	Have You not placed a hedge ... around him and his household and all
c71826	that he owns?
c71827	on every side
c71828	You have blessed the work of his hands,
c71829	and his possessions have increased in the land.
c71830	But stretch out Your hand
c71831	and strike all
c71832	that he has,
c71833	and he will surely curse You to Your face.”
c71834	said the LORD to Satan.
c71835	“Very well,” ... “Everything
c71836	he has [is]
c71837	in your hands,
c71838	but you must not lay a hand on the man himself.”
c71839	Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
c71840	One day,
c71841	while Job’s sons and daughters were eating
c71842	and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
c71843	a messenger came ... to Job:
c71844	and reported
c71845	“While the oxen were plowing
c71846	and the donkeys grazing nearby,
c71847	the Sabeans swooped down
c71848	and took them away.
c71849	They struck down the servants with the sword,
c71850	and I alone have escaped
c71851	to tell you!”
c71852	While he was still speaking,
c71853	another messenger came
c71854	and reported:
c71855	“The fire of God fell from heaven.
c71856	It burned ... the sheep and the servants,
c71857	and consumed
c71858	and I alone have escaped
c71859	to tell you!”
c71860	While he was still speaking,
c71861	another [messenger] came
c71862	and reported:
c71863	“The Chaldeans formed three bands,
c71864	raided the camels,
c71865	and took them away.
c71866	They struck down the servants with the sword,
c71867	and I alone have escaped
c71868	to tell you!”
c71869	While he was still speaking,
c71870	another messenger came
c71871	and reported:
c71872	“Your sons and daughters were eating
c71873	and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
c71874	when suddenly
c71875	a mighty wind swept in from the desert
c71876	and struck the four corners of the house.
c71877	It collapsed on the young people
c71878	and they are dead,
c71879	and I alone have escaped
c71880	to tell you!”
c71881	Then Job stood up,
c71882	tore his robe,
c71883	and shaved his head.
c71884	He fell to the ground
c71885	and worshiped,
c71886	saying:
c71887	“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
c71888	and naked I shall return.
c71889	The LORD gave,
c71890	and the LORD has taken away.
c71891	Blessed be the name of the LORD.”
c71892	In all this, Job did not sin
c71893	or charge God with wrongdoing.
c71894	On another day,
c71895	the sons of God came
c71896	to present themselves before the LORD;
c71897	and Satan also came with them
c71898	to present himself before [Him].
c71899	said the LORD to Satan.
c71900	“Where have you come from?”
c71901	[he] replied,
c71903	“From roaming through the earth,”
c71904	“and from walking back and forth in it.”
c71905	Then the LORD said to Satan,
c71906	“Have you considered My servant Job?
c71907	For [there is] no one on earth like him—
c71908	blameless and upright, fearing God
c71909	and shunning evil.
c71910	He still retains his integrity,
c71911	even though you incited Me against him
c71912	to ruin him without cause.”
c71913	Satan replied.
c71915	“Skin for skin!”
c71916	all
c71917	“A man ... he owns
c71918	will give up ... in exchange for his life.
c71919	But stretch out Your hand
c71920	and strike his flesh and bones, ... to
c71921	and he will surely curse You ... Your face.”
c71922	said the LORD to Satan.
c71923	“Very well,” ... “He is in your hands,
c71924	but you must spare his life.”
c71925	So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD
c71926	and infected Job with terrible boils from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.
c71927	And Job took a piece of broken pottery
c71928	to scrape himself
c71929	as he sat among the ashes.
c71930	Then [Job's] wife said to him,
c71931	“Do you still retain your integrity?
c71932	Curse God
c71933	and die!”
c71934	he told her.
c71935	“You speak as a foolish woman
c71936	speaks,”
c71937	“Should we accept from God only good
c71938	and not adversity?”
c71939	In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
c71940	Now when Job’s three friends— ... heard about all this adversity
c71941	that had come upon him,
c71942	came
c71943	each of them ... from his home
c71944	Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite—
c71945	and met together
c71946	to go
c71947	and sympathize with [Job]
c71948	and comfort him.
c71949	When they lifted up their eyes from afar,
c71950	they could barely recognize [Job].
c71951	aloud,
c71952	They began to weep
c71953	and each man tore his robe
c71954	and threw dust into the air over his head.
c71955	Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights,
c71956	but no one spoke a word to
c71957	him because they saw
c71958	how intense his suffering had become.
c71959	After this, Job opened his mouth
c71960	and cursed the day of his [birth].
c71961	And [this is what] [he]
c71962	said:
c71963	“May the day ... perish,
c71964	of my birth
c71965	and the night
c71966	it was said,
c71967	‘A boy is conceived.’
c71968	If only that day had turned to darkness!
c71969	May God above disregard it;
c71970	[may no] light shine upon it.
c71971	May darkness and gloom reclaim it,
c71972	and a cloud settle over it;
c71973	may the blackness of the day overwhelm it.
c71974	had taken that night
c71975	If only darkness ... away!
c71976	May it not appear among the days of the year,
c71977	or be entered in any of the months.
c71978	Behold,
c71979	may that night be barren;
c71980	may no joyful voice come into it.
c71981	May it be cursed by those who curse the day—
c71982	those prepared
c71983	to rouse Leviathan.
c71984	May its morning stars grow dark;
c71985	may it wait ... for daylight;
c71986	in vain
c71987	may it not see the breaking of dawn.
c71988	For that night did not shut the doors of the womb
c71989	to hide the sorrow from my eyes.
c71990	Why did I not perish at birth;
c71991	as I came from the womb?
c71992	why did I not die
c71993	Why were there knees to receive me,
c71994	[and] breasts
c71995	that I should be nursed?
c71996	For now I would be lying down
c71997	in peace;
c71998	I would be asleep
c71999	and at rest
c72000	with kings and counselors of the earth,
c72001	who built for themselves cities now in ruins,
c72002	or with princes
c72003	who had gold,
c72004	who filled their houses with silver.
c72005	Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child,
c72006	like an infant
c72007	who never sees daylight?
c72008	There the wicked cease from raging,
c72009	and there the weary find rest.
c72010	The captives enjoy their ease;
c72011	they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
c72012	Both small and great are there,
c72013	and the slave is freed from his master.
c72014	Why is light given to the miserable,
c72015	and life to the bitter of soul,
c72016	who long for death
c72017	that does not come,
c72018	and search for it like hidden treasure,
c72019	who rejoice and greatly
c72020	exult
c72021	when they can find the grave?
c72022	Why is life given to a man
c72023	whose way is hidden,
c72024	whom God has hedged in?
c72025	I sigh when food is put before me,
c72026	and my groans pour out like water.
c72027	For the thing I feared
c72028	has overtaken me,
c72030	and what I dreaded
c72031	has befallen me.
c72032	I am not at ease
c72033	or quiet; I have no
c72034	rest,
c72035	for trouble has come.”
c72036	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
c72038	“If one ventures a word with you,
c72039	will you be wearied?
c72041	keep from speaking?
c72042	Yet who can
c72043	Surely
c72044	you have instructed many,
c72045	and have strengthened their feeble hands.
c72046	Your words have steadied those who stumbled,
c72047	and have made firm the knees that were buckling.
c72048	But now it has come upon you,
c72049	and you are weary.
c72050	It strikes you,
c72051	and you are dismayed.
c72052	Is your reverence not your confidence,
c72053	and the uprightness of your ways your hope?
c72054	Consider now:
c72055	Who
c72056	when he was innocent?
c72057	has perished
c72058	Or where were the upright destroyed?
c72059	As I have observed,
c72060	those who plow iniquity, and those who sow trouble, reap the same.
c72061	By the breath of God they perish,
c72062	and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.
c72063	The lion may roar, and the fierce lion may growl, yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.
c72064	The old lion perishes for lack of prey,
c72065	and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
c72066	Now a word came to me secretly;
c72067	my ears caught a whisper of it.
c72068	In disquieting visions in the night,
c72069	when deep sleep falls on men,
c72070	fear ... came over me
c72071	and trembling
c72072	and made all my bones shake.
c72073	Then a spirit glided past my face,
c72074	[and] the hair on my body bristled.
c72075	It stood still,
c72076	but I could not discern its appearance;
c72077	a form loomed before my eyes,
c72078	a whispering
c72079	and I heard ... voice:
c72080	‘Can a [mortal] be more righteous than God,
c72081	or a man more pure than his Maker?
c72082	If
c72083	God puts no trust in His servants,
c72084	and He charges His angels with error,
c72085	how much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
c72086	whose foundations are in the dust,
c72087	who can be crushed like a moth!
c72088	They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk;
c72089	unnoticed, they perish forever.
c72090	Are not their tent cords pulled up,
c72091	so that they die
c72092	without wisdom?’
c72093	Call out if you please,
c72094	but who will answer?
c72095	To which of the holy ones will you turn?
c72096	For resentment kills a fool,
c72097	and envy slays the simple.
c72098	I have seen a fool
c72099	taking root,
c72100	but suddenly his house was cursed.
c72101	His sons are far from safety,
c72102	crushed in court
c72103	without a defender.
c72104	his harvest,
c72105	The hungry consume
c72106	taking it even from the thorns;
c72107	and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
c72108	For distress does not spring from the dust,
c72109	and trouble does not sprout from the ground.
c72110	Yet man is born to trouble
c72111	as surely as sparks ... upward.
c72112	fly
c72113	However, if I were you, I would appeal to God
c72114	and lay my cause before Him
c72115	who does great
c72116	and unsearchable things,
c72117	wonders without number.
c72118	He gives rain to the earth
c72119	and sends water upon the fields.
c72120	He sets the lowly on high,
c72121	so that mourners are lifted to safety.
c72122	He thwarts the schemes of the crafty,
c72123	so that their hands find no success.
c72124	He catches the wise in their craftiness,
c72125	and sweeps away the plans of the cunning.
c72126	They encounter darkness by day
c72127	and grope at noon as in the night.
c72128	He saves ... from the sword in their mouth
c72129	the needy ... and from the clutches of the powerful.
c72130	So the poor have hope,
c72131	and injustice shuts its mouth.
c72132	Blessed indeed is the man
c72133	[whom] God corrects;
c72134	so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
c72135	For He wounds,
c72136	but also binds;
c72137	He strikes,
c72138	but His hands also heal.
c72139	He will rescue you from six calamities;
c72140	no harm will touch you in seven.
c72141	In famine He will redeem you from death,
c72142	and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
c72143	You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
c72144	and need not fear destruction
c72145	when it comes.
c72146	You will laugh at destruction and famine,
c72147	and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
c72148	For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field,
c72149	and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
c72150	You will know
c72151	that your tent is secure,
c72152	when inspecting your home.
c72153	and find nothing amiss
c72154	You will know
c72155	that your offspring will be many,
c72156	and your descendants [will be] like the grass of the earth.
c72157	You will come to the grave in full vigor,
c72158	like a sheaf of grain gathered in season.
c72159	Indeed,
c72160	we have investigated,
c72161	and it is true!
c72162	So hear it
c72163	and know for yourself.”
c72164	Then Job replied:
c72166	“If only my grief could be weighed
c72167	and placed with my calamity on the scales.
c72168	For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas—
c72169	no wonder my words have been rash.
c72170	For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me;
c72171	my spirit drinks in their poison;
c72172	the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
c72173	Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass,
c72174	or an ox low over its fodder?
c72175	Is tasteless food eaten without salt,
c72176	or is there flavor in the white of an egg?
c72177	refuses
c72178	to touch them;
c72179	My soul
c72180	they are loathsome food to me.
c72181	If only
c72182	my request were granted
c72183	and God would fulfill my hope:
c72184	that God would be willing
c72185	to crush me,
c72186	to unleash His hand
c72187	and cut me off!
c72188	It still brings me comfort,
c72189	and joy ... pain,
c72190	through unrelenting
c72191	that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
c72192	What strength do I have,
c72193	that I should still hope?
c72194	What is my future,
c72195	that I should be patient?
c72196	Is my strength like that of stone, or
c72197	my flesh made of bronze?
c72198	[Is] there any help within me,
c72199	now that success is driven from me?
c72200	A despairing man [should have] the kindness of his friend,
c72201	even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
c72202	[But] my brothers are as faithless as a wadi,
c72203	as seasonal streams that overflow,
c72204	darkened because of the ice
c72205	and the inflow of melting snow,
c72206	in the dry season
c72208	but ceasing
c72209	in the heat.
c72210	[and] vanishing from their channels
c72211	Caravans turn aside from their routes;
c72212	they go into the wasteland
c72213	and perish.
c72214	The caravans of Tema look [for water];
c72215	the travelers of Sheba hope to find it.
c72216	They are confounded
c72217	by their confidence;
c72218	their arrival
c72219	brings disappointment.
c72220	For now you are of no help;
c72221	you see terror,
c72222	and you are afraid.
c72223	Have I ever said:
c72224	‘Give me something;
c72225	offer me a bribe from your wealth;
c72226	‘deliver me from the hand of the enemy;
c72227	redeem me from the grasp of the ruthless’?
c72228	Teach me,
c72229	and I will be silent.
c72231	how I have erred.
c72232	Help me understand
c72233	How painful [are] honest words!
c72234	But what does your argument prove?
c72236	to correct my words,
c72237	Do you intend
c72238	and treat the speech of a desperate man as wind?
c72239	You would even cast lots
c72240	for the fatherless and negotiate a price for your friend.
c72241	But now,
c72242	please
c72243	look at me;
c72244	to your face?
c72245	would I lie
c72246	Reconsider;
c72247	do not be unjust.
c72248	Reconsider,
c72249	for my righteousness is at stake.
c72250	Is there iniquity on my tongue?
c72251	Can my mouth not discern malice?
c72252	Is not man consigned to labor on earth?
c72253	Are not his days like those of a hired hand?
c72254	Like a slave
c72255	he longs for shade;
c72256	like a hired man
c72257	he waits for his wages.
c72258	So I am allotted months of futility,
c72259	and nights of misery are appointed me.
c72260	When I lie down
c72261	I think:
c72262	‘When will I get up?’
c72263	But the night drags on,
c72264	and I toss and turn until dawn.
c72265	My flesh is clothed with worms and encrusted with dirt;
c72266	my skin is cracked
c72267	and festering.
c72268	My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle;
c72269	they come to an end without hope.
c72270	Remember
c72271	that my life is but a breath.
c72272	My eyes will never again
c72273	see happiness.
c72274	The eye ... will no longer see me.
c72275	that beholds me
c72276	You will look for me,
c72277	but I will be no more.
c72278	As a cloud vanishes
c72279	and is gone,
c72280	so
c72281	he who goes down to Sheol
c72282	will never rise again.
c72283	He will never return to his house;
c72284	his place will remember him no more.
c72285	Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;
c72286	I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
c72287	I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
c72288	Am I the sea,
c72289	or the monster of the deep,
c72290	that You must keep me under guard?
c72291	When I think
c72292	my bed will comfort me,
c72293	and my couch will ease my complaint,
c72294	then You frighten me with dreams,
c72295	and terrify me with visions,
c72296	so that I would prefer strangling
c72297	and death over my life in this body.
c72298	I loathe [my life]!
c72299	I would not live forever.
c72300	Leave me alone
c72301	,for my days [are] [but] a breath.
c72302	What is man
c72303	that You should exalt him,
c72304	that You should set Your heart upon him,
c72305	that You attend to him every morning,
c72306	[and] test him every moment?
c72307	Will You never look away from me,
c72308	or let me alone
c72309	to swallow my spittle?
c72310	If I have sinned,
c72311	what have I done to You,
c72312	O Watcher of mankind?
c72313	Why have You made me Your target,
c72314	so that I am a burden to You?
c72315	Why do You not pardon my transgression
c72316	and take away my iniquity?
c72317	For soon I will lie down in the dust;
c72318	You will seek me,
c72319	but I will be no more.”
c72320	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
c72322	“How long will you go on saying such things?
c72323	The words of your mouth are a blustering wind.
c72324	Does God pervert justice?
c72325	Or does the Almighty pervert what is right?
c72326	When your children sinned against Him,
c72327	He gave them over to their rebellion.
c72328	But if you would earnestly seek God
c72329	and ask the Almighty for mercy,
c72330	if you are pure and upright,
c72331	even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf
c72332	and restore your righteous estate.
c72333	Though your beginnings were modest,
c72334	your latter days will be full of prosperity.
c72335	Please inquire of past generations
c72336	and consider the discoveries of their fathers.
c72337	For we [were born] yesterday
c72338	and know nothing;
c72339	our days on earth are but a shadow.
c72340	Will they not teach you
c72341	and tell you,
c72342	and speak from their understanding?
c72343	Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh?
c72344	Do reeds flourish without water?
c72345	While the shoots
c72346	are still uncut,
c72347	they dry up quicker than grass.
c72348	Such is the destiny of all who forget God;
c72349	so the hope of the godless will perish.
c72350	His confidence is fragile;
c72351	his security is in a spider’s web.
c72352	He leans on his web,
c72353	but it gives way;
c72354	he holds fast,
c72355	but it does not endure.
c72356	He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine,
c72357	spreading its shoots over the garden.
c72358	His roots wrap around the rock heap;
c72359	he looks for a home among the stones.
c72360	If he is uprooted from his place,
c72361	it will disown him,
c72362	saying, ‘ I never saw you.’
c72363	Surely this is the joy of His way;
c72364	yet others will spring from the dust.
c72365	Behold,
c72366	God does not reject the blameless,
c72367	nor will He strengthen the hand of evildoers.
c72368	He will yet fill your mouth with laughter,
c72369	and your lips with a shout of joy.
c72370	Your enemies will be clothed in shame,
c72371	and the tent of the wicked
c72372	will be no more.”
c72373	Then Job answered:
c72375	“Yes, I know
c72376	that [it is] so,
c72377	but how can a mortal be righteous before God?
c72378	If one wished
c72379	to contend with [God],
c72380	he could not answer Him one [time] out of a thousand.
c72381	[God is] wise in heart and mighty in strength.
c72382	Who has hardened [himself] against Him
c72383	and prospered?
c72384	He moves mountains
c72385	without their knowledge,
c72386	when He overturns them in His anger.
c72387	He shakes the earth from its place,
c72388	so that its foundations tremble.
c72389	He commands the sun
c72390	not to shine,
c72391	and seals off the stars.
c72392	He alone stretches out the heavens,
c72393	and treads on the waves of the sea.
c72394	He is the Maker of the Bear [and] Orion, of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
c72395	He does great and unfathomable [things],
c72396	wonders without number.
c72397	Were He to pass by me,
c72398	I would not see Him;
c72399	were He to move,
c72400	I would not recognize Him.
c72401	If He snatches away,
c72402	who can hinder Him?
c72403	Who can say to Him,
c72404	‘What are You doing?’
c72405	God does not restrain His anger;
c72406	the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him.
c72407	How then can I answer Him
c72408	or choose my arguments against Him?
c72409	For
c72410	even if I were right,
c72411	I could not answer.
c72412	I could only beg my Judge for mercy.
c72413	If I summoned Him
c72414	and He answered me,
c72415	I do not believe
c72416	He would listen to my voice.
c72417	For He would crush me with a tempest
c72418	and multiply my wounds without cause.
c72419	He does not let
c72420	me catch my breath,
c72421	but overwhelms me with bitterness.
c72422	If it is a matter of strength,
c72423	He is indeed mighty!
c72424	If it is a matter of justice,
c72425	who can summon Him?
c72426	Even if I were righteous,
c72427	my mouth would condemn me;
c72428	if I were blameless,
c72429	it would declare me guilty.
c72430	Though I am blameless,
c72431	I have no concern for myself;
c72432	I despise my life.
c72433	It is all the same;
c72434	that is why I say,
c72435	‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’
c72436	When the scourge brings sudden death,
c72437	He mocks the despair of the innocent.
c72438	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
c72439	He blindfolds its judges.
c72440	If it is not [He], then
c72441	who [is] it?
c72442	My days are swifter than a runner;
c72443	they flee
c72444	without seeing any good.
c72445	They sweep by like boats of papyrus,
c72446	like an eagle
c72447	swooping down on its prey.
c72448	If I say,
c72449	‘I will forget my complaint,
c72450	I will change my expression,
c72451	and smile,’
c72452	I would still dread all my sufferings;
c72453	I know
c72454	that You will not acquit me.
c72455	Since I am already found guilty,
c72456	why should I labor in vain?
c72457	If I should wash myself with snow
c72458	and cleanse my hands with lye,
c72459	then You would plunge me into the pit,
c72460	and even my own clothes would despise me!
c72461	For He is not a man like me,
c72462	that I can answer Him,
c72463	that we can take each other to court.
c72464	Nor is there a mediator between us,
c72465	to lay his hand upon us both.
c72466	Let Him remove His rod from me,
c72467	so that His terror will no longer frighten me.
c72468	Then I would speak
c72469	without fear of Him.
c72470	But as it is, I am on my own.
c72471	I loathe my own life;
c72472	I will express my complaint
c72473	and speak in the bitterness of my soul.
c72474	I will say to God:
c72475	‘Do not condemn me!
c72476	Let me know
c72477	why You prosecute me.’
c72478	Does it please You
c72479	to oppress me,
c72480	to reject the work of Your hands,
c72481	and favor the schemes of the wicked?
c72482	Do You have eyes of flesh?
c72484	Do You see as man
c72485	sees?
c72486	Are Your days like those of a [mortal],
c72487	or Your years like those of a man,
c72488	that You should seek my iniquity
c72489	and search out my sin—
c72490	though You know
c72491	that I am not guilty,
c72492	and there is no deliverance from Your hand?
c72493	Your hands shaped me
c72494	formed me.
c72495	and altogether ... Will You now turn
c72496	and destroy me?
c72497	Please remember
c72498	that You molded me like clay.
c72499	Will You now return me to dust?
c72500	Did You not pour me out like milk,
c72501	and curdle me like cheese?
c72502	You clothed me with skin and flesh,
c72503	and knit me together with bones and sinews.
c72504	You have granted me life and loving devotion,
c72505	and Your care has preserved my spirit.
c72506	Yet You concealed these [things] in Your heart,
c72507	and I know
c72508	that this [was] in Your [mind]:
c72509	If I sinned,
c72510	You would take note,
c72511	and would not acquit me of my iniquity.
c72512	If I am guilty,
c72513	woe to me!
c72514	And even if I am righteous,
c72515	I cannot lift my head.
c72516	[I am] full of shame
c72517	and aware of my affliction.
c72518	Should I hold my head high,
c72519	You would hunt me like a lion,
c72520	and again
c72521	display Your power against me.
c72522	You produce new witnesses against me
c72523	and multiply Your anger toward me.
c72524	Hardships assault me in wave after wave.
c72525	Why then did You bring me from the womb?
c72526	Oh, that I had died,
c72527	and no eye had seen me!
c72528	If only I had never come
c72529	to be,
c72530	but had been carried from the womb to the grave.
c72531	Are my days not few?
c72532	Withdraw
c72533	from me,
c72534	that I may have a little comfort,
c72535	before I go—
c72536	never to return—
c72537	to a land of darkness and gloom,
c72538	to a land of utter darkness, of deep shadow
c72539	and disorder,
c72540	where even the light is like darkness.”
c72541	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
c72543	“Should this stream of words go unanswered
c72544	and such a speaker be vindicated?
c72545	Should your babbling put others to silence?
c72546	Will you scoff
c72547	without rebuke?
c72548	You have said,
c72549	‘My doctrine [is] sound,
c72550	and I am pure in Your sight.’
c72551	But
c72552	if only
c72553	God would speak
c72554	and open His lips against you,
c72555	and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom,
c72556	for true wisdom has two sides.
c72557	Know
c72558	then that God exacts from you [less] than your iniquity [deserves].
c72559	Can you fathom the deep things of God
c72560	or discover the limits of the Almighty?
c72561	They are higher than the heavens—
c72562	what can you do?
c72563	They are deeper than Sheol—
c72564	what can you know?
c72565	Their measure is longer than the earth
c72566	and wider than the sea.
c72567	If He comes along
c72568	to imprison you,
c72569	or convenes a court,
c72570	who can hinder Him?
c72571	Surely He knows the deceit of men.
c72572	If He sees iniquity,
c72573	does He not take note?
c72574	But a witless man can no more become wise
c72575	than the colt of a wild donkey can be born a man!
c72576	As for you, if you direct your heart
c72577	and lift up your hands to Him,
c72578	if ... the iniquity in your hand,
c72579	you put away
c72580	and allow no injustice to dwell in your tents,
c72581	then indeed you will lift up your face without shame;
c72582	you will stand firm
c72583	and unafraid.
c72584	For you will forget [your] misery,
c72585	it only as waters
c72586	gone by.
c72587	recalling
c72588	Your life will be brighter than noonday;
c72589	its darkness will be like the morning.
c72590	You will be secure,
c72591	because there is hope,
c72592	and you will look around
c72593	and lie down in safety.
c72594	You will lie down
c72595	without fear,
c72596	and many will court your favor.
c72597	But the eyes of the wicked will fail,
c72598	their escape route will be cut off
c72599	,and they will hope for their last breath.”
c72600	Then Job answered:
c72602	“Truly
c72603	then you are the people,
c72604	and wisdom will die with you!
c72605	But I also have a mind;
c72606	I am not inferior to you.
c72607	Who does not [know] such things as these?
c72608	I am a laughingstock to my friends,
c72609	though I called on God,
c72610	and He answered.
c72611	The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock.
c72612	The one at ease despises misfortune as the fate
c72613	of those whose feet are slipping.
c72614	The tents of robbers are safe,
c72615	and those who provoke God are secure—
c72616	those who carry their god in their hands.
c72617	But
c72618	ask the animals,
c72619	and they will instruct you;
c72620	ask the birds of the air,
c72621	and they will tell you.
c72622	Or speak to the earth,
c72623	and it will teach you;
c72624	let the fish of the sea inform you.
c72625	Which of all these does not know
c72626	that the hand of the LORD has done this?
c72627	The life of every living thing is in His hand, as well as the breath of all mankind.
c72628	Does not the ear test words
c72629	as the tongue tastes its food?
c72630	Wisdom is found with the elderly,
c72631	and understanding comes with long life.
c72632	Wisdom and strength belong to God;
c72633	counsel and understanding are His.
c72634	What
c72635	He tears down
c72636	cannot be rebuilt;
c72637	the man He imprisons
c72638	cannot be released.
c72639	If
c72640	He holds back the waters,
c72641	they dry up,
c72642	and if He releases them,
c72643	they overwhelm the land.
c72644	True wisdom and power belong to Him.
c72645	The deceived and the deceiver [are His].
c72646	He leads counselors away barefoot
c72647	and makes fools of judges.
c72648	He loosens the bonds placed by kings
c72649	and fastens a belt around their waists.
c72650	He leads priests away barefoot
c72651	and overthrows the established.
c72652	He deprives the trusted of speech
c72653	and takes away the discernment of elders.
c72654	He pours out contempt on nobles
c72655	and disarms the mighty.
c72656	He reveals the deep things of darkness
c72657	and brings deep shadows into light.
c72658	He makes nations great,
c72659	and destroys them;
c72660	He enlarges nations,
c72661	and sends them away.
c72662	He deprives the earth's leaders of reason,
c72663	and makes them wander ... wasteland.
c72664	a trackless
c72665	They grope in darkness
c72666	with no light;
c72667	He makes them stagger like drunkards.
c72668	Behold,
c72669	my eyes have seen all this;
c72670	my ears have heard
c72671	and understood.
c72672	What you know, I also know;
c72673	I am not inferior to you.
c72674	Yet
c72675	I ... to speak to the Almighty
c72677	and argue my case before God.
c72678	desire
c72679	however,
c72680	You, ... smear with lies;
c72681	you are all worthless physicians.
c72682	If only
c72683	you would be silent;
c72684	for that would be your wisdom!
c72685	Hear now my argument,
c72686	and listen to the plea of my lips.
c72687	Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf
c72688	or speak deceitfully for Him?
c72689	Would you show Him partiality
c72690	or argue in His defense?
c72691	Would it be well
c72692	when He examined you?
c72694	Could you deceive Him ... a man?
c72695	[like]
c72696	Surely He would rebuke you
c72697	if you secretly showed partiality.
c72698	Would His majesty not terrify you?
c72699	Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?
c72700	Your maxims are proverbs of ashes;
c72701	your defenses are defenses of clay.
c72702	Be silent,
c72703	and I will speak.
c72704	Then let come to me
c72705	what [may].
c72706	Why do I put myself at risk
c72707	and take my life in my own hands?
c72708	Though
c72709	He slay me,
c72710	I will hope in Him.
c72711	I will still defend my ways to His face.
c72712	Moreover, this will be my salvation,
c72713	for no godless man can appear before Him.
c72714	Listen carefully to my words;
c72715	let my declaration ring in your ears.
c72716	Behold, now that
c72717	I have prepared my case,
c72718	I know
c72719	that I will be vindicated.
c72720	Can anyone
c72721	indict me?
c72722	If so, I will be silent
c72723	and die.
c72724	Only grant these two things to me,
c72725	so that I need not hide from You:
c72726	Withdraw Your hand from me,
c72727	and do not let Your terror frighten me.
c72728	Then call me,
c72729	and I will answer,
c72730	or let me speak,
c72731	and You can reply.
c72732	How many [are] my iniquities and sins?
c72733	Reveal to me my transgression and sin.
c72734	Why do You hide Your face
c72735	and consider me as Your enemy?
c72736	Will You frighten a windblown leaf?
c72737	Will You chase after dry chaff?
c72738	For You record bitter accusations against me
c72739	and bequeath to me the iniquities of my youth.
c72740	You put my feet in the stocks
c72741	and stand watch over all my paths;
c72742	You set a limit for the soles of my feet.
c72743	So man wastes away like something rotten,
c72744	garment.
c72745	like a moth-eaten
c72746	Man, who is born of woman, is short of days and full of trouble.
c72747	Like a flower, he comes forth,
c72748	then withers away;
c72749	like a fleeting shadow,
c72750	he does not endure.
c72751	Do You open your eyes to one like this? ... You?
c72752	Will You bring him into judgment before
c72753	Who can bring clean out of unclean?
c72754	No one!
c72755	Since his days [are] determined
c72756	and the number of his months [is] with You,
c72757	and since You have set limits
c72758	that he cannot exceed,
c72759	look away from him
c72760	and let him rest,
c72761	so he can enjoy his day as a hired hand.
c72762	For there is hope for a tree:
c72763	If it is cut down,
c72764	it will sprout again,
c72765	and its tender shoots will not fail.
c72766	If its roots grow old in the ground
c72767	and its stump dies in the soil,
c72768	at the scent of water it will bud
c72769	and put forth twigs like a sapling.
c72770	But a man dies
c72771	and is laid low;
c72772	he breathes his last,
c72773	and where [is] he?
c72774	As water disappears from the sea
c72775	and a river becomes parched
c72776	and dry,
c72777	so man lies down
c72778	and does not rise.
c72779	Until the heavens are no more, he will not be awakened
c72780	[or] roused from his sleep.
c72781	If only
c72782	You would hide me in Sheol
c72783	and conceal me
c72784	until Your anger passes.
c72785	If only You would appoint a time for me
c72786	and then remember me.
c72787	When a man dies,
c72788	will he live [again]?
c72789	All the days of my hard service I will wait,
c72790	until my relief comes.
c72791	You will call,
c72792	and I will answer You;
c72793	You will desire the work of Your hands.
c72794	For then You would count my steps,
c72795	but would not keep track of my sin.
c72796	My transgression would be sealed in a bag,
c72797	and You would cover over my iniquity.
c72798	But
c72799	as a mountain erodes and crumbles
c72800	and a rock is dislodged from its place,
c72801	as water wears away stones
c72802	and torrents wash away the soil,
c72803	so You destroy a man’s hope.
c72804	You forever overpower him,
c72805	and he passes on;
c72806	You change his countenance
c72807	and send him away.
c72808	If his sons receive honor,
c72809	he does not know it;
c72810	if they are brought low,
c72811	he is unaware.
c72812	He feels only the pain of his own body ... only for
c72813	and mourns ... himself.”
c72814	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
c72816	“Does a wise man answer with empty counsel
c72817	or fill his belly with the hot east wind?
c72818	Should he argue ... words
c72819	with useless
c72820	or speeches
c72821	that serve no purpose?
c72822	But you even undermine the fear [of God]
c72823	and hinder meditation before Him.
c72824	For your iniquity instructs your mouth,
c72825	and you choose the language of the crafty.
c72826	Your own mouth condemns you,
c72827	not mine;
c72828	your own lips testify against you.
c72829	Were you the first man ever born?
c72830	Were you brought forth before the hills?
c72831	Do you listen in on God's council
c72832	or limit wisdom to yourself?
c72833	What do you know
c72834	that we do not?
c72835	What do you understand
c72836	that is not clear to us?
c72837	Both the gray-haired and the aged are on our side—
c72838	men much older than your father.
c72839	Are the consolations of God not enough for you,
c72840	even words [spoken] gently to you?
c72841	Why has your heart carried you away,
c72842	and why do your eyes flash,
c72843	as you turn your spirit against God
c72844	and pour such words out of your mouth?
c72845	What is man,
c72846	that he should be pure,
c72847	or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?
c72848	If
c72849	God puts no trust in His holy ones,
c72850	if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes,
c72851	how much less ... who is vile
c72852	man, ... and corrupt,
c72853	who drinks injustice like water?
c72854	and I will inform you.
c72855	Listen to me
c72856	what I have seen,
c72857	I will describe
c72858	what was declared by wise men
c72859	and was not concealed from their fathers,
c72860	to whom alone the land was given
c72861	when no foreigner passed among them:
c72862	A wicked man writhes in pain all his days;
c72863	only a few years are reserved for the ruthless.
c72864	Sounds of terror fill his ears;
c72865	in his prosperity the destroyer attacks him.
c72866	He despairs of
c72867	his return from darkness;
c72868	he is marked for the sword.
c72869	He wanders about as food
c72870	for vultures;
c72871	he knows
c72872	the day of darkness is at hand.
c72873	Distress and anguish terrify him,
c72874	overwhelming him like a king
c72875	poised to attack.
c72876	For he has stretched out his hand against God
c72877	and has vaunted himself against the Almighty,
c72878	rushing headlong at Him with his thick, studded shield.
c72879	Though his face is covered with fat
c72880	and his waistline bulges with flesh,
c72881	he will dwell in ruined cities,
c72882	houses
c72883	in abandoned
c72884	destined to crumble.
c72885	He will no longer be rich;
c72886	his wealth will not endure.
c72887	His possessions will not spread over the land.
c72888	He will not escape from the darkness;
c72889	the flame will wither his shoots,
c72890	and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.
c72891	Let him not ... with trust in emptiness,
c72892	deceive himself
c72893	for emptiness will be his reward.
c72894	It will be paid in full before his time,
c72895	and his branch will not flourish.
c72896	He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes,
c72897	and like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.
c72898	For the company of the godless [will be] barren,
c72899	and fire will consume the tents of bribery.
c72900	They conceive trouble
c72901	and give birth to evil;
c72902	their womb prepares deceit.”
c72903	Then Job answered:
c72905	“I have heard many things like these;
c72906	miserable comforters are you all.
c72907	Is there no end to your long-winded speeches?
c72908	What provokes you
c72909	to continue testifying?
c72910	I could also speak like you
c72911	if you were in my place;
c72912	I could heap up words against you
c72913	and shake my head at you.
c72914	But I would encourage you with my mouth,
c72915	and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.
c72916	Even if I speak,
c72917	my pain is not relieved,
c72918	and if I hold back,
c72919	how will it go away?
c72920	Surely He has now exhausted me;
c72921	You have devastated all my family.
c72922	You have shriveled me up
c72923	[as] a witness [against me];
c72924	my frailty rises up
c72925	and testifies against me.
c72926	His anger has torn me
c72927	and hated me;
c72928	He gnashes His teeth at me.
c72929	My adversary pierces me with His eyes.
c72930	They open their mouths against me
c72931	and strike my cheeks with contempt;
c72932	they join together against me.
c72933	God has delivered me to unjust men;
c72934	He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked.
c72935	I was at ease,
c72936	but He shattered me;
c72937	He seized me by the neck
c72938	and crushed me.
c72939	He has set me up as His target;
c72940	His archers surround me.
c72941	He pierces my kidneys
c72942	without mercy
c72943	and spills my gall on the ground.
c72944	He breaks me with wound upon wound;
c72945	He rushes me like a warrior.
c72946	I have sewn sackcloth over my skin;
c72947	I have buried my horn in the dust.
c72948	My face is red with weeping,
c72949	and deep shadows circle my eyes;
c72950	yet my hands are free of violence
c72951	and my prayer is pure.
c72952	O earth,
c72953	do not cover my blood;
c72954	may my cry for help never be laid to rest.
c72955	Even now
c72957	my witness is in heaven,
c72958	and my advocate is on high!
c72959	My friends are my scoffers
c72960	as my eyes pour out [tears] to God.
c72961	Oh, that a man might plead with God
c72962	as [he] [pleads] with his neighbor!
c72963	For when only a few years are past
c72964	the way
c72965	of no return.
c72966	I will go
c72967	My spirit is broken;
c72968	my days are extinguished;
c72969	the grave awaits me.
c72970	Surely mockers surround me
c72972	at their rebellion.
c72973	and my eyes must gaze
c72974	Give [me], I pray,
c72975	the pledge You [demand].
c72976	Who else
c72977	will be my guarantor?
c72978	You have closed their minds to understanding;
c72979	therefore You will not exalt them.
c72980	If a man denounces his friends for a price,
c72981	the eyes of his children will fail.
c72982	He has made me
c72983	a byword to the people;
c72984	I am the one in whose face they spit.
c72985	My eyes have grown dim with grief,
c72986	body
c72987	and my whole ... is but a shadow.
c72988	The upright are appalled at this,
c72989	and the innocent are stirred against the godless.
c72990	Yet the righteous will hold to his way,
c72991	and the one with clean hands will grow stronger.
c72992	But
c72993	and try again, all of you.
c72994	come back
c72995	For I will not find a wise man among you.
c72996	My days have passed;
c72997	my plans are broken off—
c72998	even the desires of my heart.
c72999	They have turned night into day
c73000	and have made light seem near in the face of darkness.
c73001	If I look for Sheol as my home,
c73002	if I spread out my bed in darkness,
c73003	and say to corruption,
c73004	‘You [are] my father,’
c73005	‘My mother,’
c73006	or ‘My sister,’
c73007	and to the worm,
c73008	where then is my hope?
c73009	any hope for me?
c73010	Who can see
c73011	Will it go down to the gates of Sheol?
c73012	Will we go down together into the dust?”
c73013	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
c73015	“How long until you end these speeches?
c73016	Show some sense,
c73017	and then we can talk.
c73018	Why are we regarded as cattle,
c73019	as stupid in your sight?
c73020	You who tear yourself in anger—
c73021	should the earth be forsaken on your account,
c73022	or the rocks be moved from their place?
c73023	Indeed, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished;
c73024	the flame of his fire does not glow.
c73025	The light in his tent grows dark,
c73026	and the lamp beside him goes out.
c73027	His vigorous stride is shortened,
c73028	and his own schemes trip him up.
c73029	For his own feet lead him into a net,
c73030	and he wanders into its mesh.
c73031	A trap seizes his heel;
c73032	a snare grips him.
c73033	A noose is hidden in the ground,
c73034	and a trap lies in his path.
c73035	Terrors frighten him on every side
c73036	and harass his every step.
c73037	His strength is depleted,
c73038	and calamity [is] ready at his side.
c73039	It devours patches of his skin;
c73040	the firstborn of death devours his limbs.
c73041	He is torn from the shelter of his tent
c73042	and is marched off to the king of terrors.
c73043	resides in his tent;
c73044	Fire
c73045	brimstone is scattered over his home.
c73046	The roots beneath him dry up,
c73047	and the branches above him wither away.
c73048	The memory of him perishes from the earth,
c73049	and he has no name in the land.
c73050	He is driven from light into darkness
c73051	and is chased from the inhabited world.
c73052	He has no offspring
c73053	or posterity among his people,
c73054	no survivor where he once lived.
c73055	Those in the west are appalled at his fate,
c73056	while those in the east tremble in horror.
c73057	Surely such is the dwelling of the wicked,
c73058	and this is the place
c73059	of one who does not know God.”
c73060	Then Job answered:
c73062	“How long will you torment me
c73063	and crush me with words?
c73064	Ten times now, you have reproached me;
c73065	you shamelessly
c73066	mistreat me.
c73067	Even if I have truly gone astray,
c73068	my error concerns me alone.
c73069	If indeed you would exalt [yourselves] above me
c73070	and use my disgrace against me,
c73071	then understand
c73072	that it is God who has wronged me
c73073	and drawn His net around me.
c73074	Though I cry out,
c73075	‘Violence!’
c73076	I get no response;
c73077	though I call for help,
c73078	there is no justice.
c73079	He has blocked my way
c73080	so I cannot pass;
c73081	He has veiled my paths with darkness.
c73082	He has stripped me of my honor
c73083	and removed the crown from my head.
c73084	He tears me down on every side
c73085	until I am gone;
c73086	He uproots my hope like a tree.
c73087	His anger burns against me,
c73088	and He counts me among His enemies.
c73089	His troops advance together;
c73090	they construct a ramp against me
c73091	and encamp around my tent.
c73092	He has removed my brothers from me;
c73093	my acquaintances have abandoned me.
c73094	My kinsmen have failed me,
c73095	and my friends have forgotten me.
c73096	My guests and maidservants count me as a stranger;
c73097	I am a foreigner in their sight.
c73098	I call for my servant,
c73099	but he does not answer,
c73100	though I implore him with my own mouth.
c73101	My breath is repulsive to my wife,
c73102	and I am loathsome to my own family.
c73103	Even little boys scorn me;
c73104	when I appear,
c73105	they deride me.
c73106	All my best friends despise me,
c73107	and those I love
c73108	have turned against me.
c73109	My skin and flesh cling to my bones;
c73110	I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
c73111	Have pity on me,
c73112	have pity,
c73113	my friends,
c73114	for the hand of God has struck me.
c73115	Why do you persecute me as God does?
c73116	Will you never get enough of my flesh?
c73117	I wish
c73118	that my words were recorded
c73119	in a book,
c73120	and inscribed
c73121	by an iron stylus on lead, or chiseled in stone forever.
c73122	But I know
c73123	that my Redeemer lives,
c73124	and that at the last He will stand upon the earth.
c73125	Even after my skin has been destroyed,
c73126	yet in my flesh I will see God.
c73127	I will see Him for myself;
c73128	my eyes will behold Him,
c73129	and not as a stranger.
c73130	How my heart yearns within me!
c73131	If you say,
c73132	‘How shall we persecute him,
c73133	since the root of the matter lies with him?’
c73134	then you should fear the sword yourselves,
c73135	because wrath brings punishment by the sword,
c73136	so that you may know [there is] a judgment.”
c73137	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
c73139	“For this reason my anxious thoughts compel me to answer,
c73140	because of the turmoil within me.
c73141	I have heard a rebuke that insults me,
c73142	and my understanding makes me reply.
c73143	Do you not know that from antiquity,
c73144	since man was placed on the earth,
c73145	the triumph of the wicked has been brief
c73146	and the joy of the godless momentary?
c73147	Though his arrogance reaches the heavens,
c73148	and his head touches the clouds,
c73149	he will perish forever, like his own dung;
c73150	those who had seen him will ask,
c73151	‘Where is he?’
c73152	He will fly away like a dream,
c73153	never to be found;
c73154	he will be chased away like a vision in the night.
c73155	The eye [that] saw him
c73156	will see him no more,
c73157	and his place will no longer behold him.
c73158	His sons will seek the favor of the poor,
c73159	for his own hands must return his wealth.
c73160	The youthful vigor that fills his bones
c73161	will lie down with him in the dust.
c73162	Though evil is sweet in his mouth
c73163	and he conceals it under his tongue,
c73164	though he cannot bear
c73165	to let it go
c73166	and keeps it in his mouth,
c73167	yet his food will sour in his stomach
c73168	to the venom of cobras within him.
c73169	He swallows wealth
c73170	but vomits it out;
c73171	God will force it from his stomach.
c73172	He will suck the poison of cobras;
c73173	the fangs of a viper will kill him.
c73174	He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
c73175	He must return the fruit of his labor
c73176	without consuming it;
c73177	the profits of his trading.
c73178	he cannot enjoy
c73179	For he has oppressed
c73180	[and] forsaken the poor;
c73181	he has seized houses
c73182	he did not build.
c73183	Because his appetite is never satisfied,
c73184	he cannot escape with his treasure.
c73185	Nothing is left
c73186	for him to consume;
c73187	therefore, his prosperity will not endure.
c73188	In the midst of his plenty,
c73189	he will be distressed;
c73190	the full force of misery will come upon him.
c73191	When he
c73192	has filled his stomach,
c73193	God will vent His fury upon him,
c73194	raining it down on him as he eats.
c73195	Though he flees from an iron weapon,
c73196	a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him.
c73197	It is drawn
c73198	out of his back,
c73199	the gleaming point out of his liver. ... come
c73200	Terrors ... over him.
c73201	Total darkness is reserved for his treasures.
c73202	A fire ... will consume him
c73203	unfanned
c73204	and devour what is left in his tent.
c73205	The heavens will expose his iniquity,
c73206	and the earth will rise up against him.
c73207	The possessions of his house will be removed,
c73208	flowing away on the day of God’s wrath.
c73209	This is the wicked man’s portion from God,
c73210	the inheritance God has appointed him.”
c73211	Then Job answered:
c73213	“Listen carefully to my words;
c73214	let this be your consolation [to me].
c73215	Bear with
c73216	me while I speak;
c73217	then after I have spoken, you may keep mocking.
c73218	Is my
c73219	complaint against a man?
c73221	Then why should I not be impatient?
c73222	Look at me
c73223	and be astonished;
c73224	put your hand over your mouth.
c73225	When I remember,
c73226	terror
c73227	takes hold, and my body trembles in horror.
c73228	Why do the wicked live on,
c73229	growing old
c73230	and increasing in power?
c73231	Their descendants
c73232	are established
c73233	around them,
c73234	and their offspring before their eyes.
c73235	Their homes are safe
c73236	from fear;
c73237	the rod of God is not upon them.
c73238	Their bulls breed
c73239	without fail;
c73240	their cows calve
c73241	and do not miscarry.
c73242	They send forth their little ones like a flock;
c73243	their children skip about,
c73244	singing to the tambourine and lyre
c73245	and making merry at the sound of the flute.
c73246	They spend their days in prosperity
c73247	and go down to Sheol in peace.
c73248	Yet they say to God:
c73249	‘Leave us alone
c73250	!For we have no desire to know Your ways.
c73251	Who is the Almighty,
c73252	that we should serve Him,
c73253	and what would we gain
c73254	if we pray to Him?’
c73255	Yet
c73256	their prosperity [is] not in their own hands,
c73257	so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.
c73258	How often is the lamp of the wicked put out?
c73259	Does disaster come upon them?
c73260	Does [God,] in His anger, apportion destruction?
c73261	Are they like straw before the wind,
c73262	like chaff
c73263	swept away by a storm?
c73264	[It is said that] God lays up one's punishment for his children.
c73265	Let God repay the man himself,
c73266	so that he may know it.
c73267	Let his own eyes see his destruction;
c73268	let him drink [for himself] the wrath of the Almighty.
c73269	For what does he care about his household after him,
c73270	when the number of his months has run out?
c73271	Can anyone teach knowledge to God,
c73272	since He judges those on high?
c73273	One man dies full of vigor,
c73274	completely secure and at ease.
c73275	His body is well fed,
c73276	and his bones rich with marrow.
c73277	Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul,
c73278	having never tasted prosperity.
c73279	But together they lie down in the dust,
c73280	and worms cover them [both].
c73281	Behold,
c73282	I know your thoughts full well,
c73283	the schemes by which
c73284	you would wrong me.
c73285	For you say,
c73286	‘Where now is the nobleman’s house,
c73287	and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?’
c73288	Have you never asked those who travel the roads?
c73289	Do you not accept their reports?
c73290	Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of calamity,
c73291	delivered from the day of wrath.
c73292	Who will denounce his behavior to his face?
c73293	for what he has done?
c73294	Who will repay him
c73295	He is carried to the grave,
c73296	and watch is kept over his tomb.
c73297	The clods of the valley are sweet to him;
c73298	everyone follows behind him,
c73299	and those before him
c73300	are without number.
c73301	So how can you comfort me with empty words?
c73302	For your answers
c73303	remain [full of] falsehood.”
c73304	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
c73306	“Can a man be of use to God?
c73307	Can even a wise man benefit Him?
c73308	Does it delight the Almighty
c73309	that you are righteous?
c73310	Does He profit
c73311	if your ways are blameless?
c73312	Is it for your reverence that He rebukes you
c73313	and enters into judgment against you?
c73314	Is not your wickedness great?
c73315	Are not your iniquities endless?
c73316	For you demanded security from your brothers without cause,
c73317	stripping off their clothes and leaving them naked.
c73318	You gave no water to the weary
c73319	and withheld food from the famished,
c73320	belonged to a mighty man,
c73321	while the land
c73322	and a man of honor lived on it.
c73323	You sent widows away empty-handed,
c73324	and the strength of the fatherless was crushed.
c73325	Therefore snares surround you,
c73326	and sudden peril terrifies you;
c73327	it is so dark you cannot see,
c73328	and a flood of water covers you.
c73329	Is not God as high as the heavens?
c73330	Look at the highest stars,
c73331	how lofty they are!
c73332	Yet you say:
c73333	‘What does God know?
c73334	Does He judge through thick darkness?
c73335	Clouds veil Him
c73336	so that He cannot see,
c73337	as He traverses heaven's horizon.’
c73338	Will you stay on the ancient path
c73339	that wicked men have trod?
c73340	They were snatched away
c73341	before their time,
c73342	and their foundations were swept away by a river.
c73343	They said to God,
c73344	‘Depart from us.
c73345	What can the Almighty do to us?’
c73346	But it was He who filled their houses with good things;
c73347	so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.
c73348	The righteous see [it]
c73349	and are glad;
c73350	the innocent mock them, saying,
c73351	‘Surely our foes are destroyed,
c73352	and fire has consumed their excess.’
c73353	Reconcile now ... with Him;
c73354	and be at peace
c73355	thereby good will come to you.
c73356	Receive instruction from His mouth,
c73357	and lay up His words in your heart.
c73358	If you return to the Almighty,
c73359	you will be restored.
c73360	If you remove injustice from your tents
c73361	and consign your gold to the dust
c73362	and the gold of Ophir to the stones of the ravines,
c73363	then the Almighty will be your gold
c73364	and the finest silver for you.
c73365	Surely then you will delight in the Almighty
c73366	and lift up your face to God.
c73367	You will pray to Him,
c73368	and He will hear you,
c73369	and you will fulfill your vows.
c73370	Your decisions
c73371	will be carried out,
c73372	and light will shine on your ways.
c73373	When men are brought low
c73374	and you say,
c73375	‘Lift them up,’
c73376	then He will save the lowly.
c73377	He will deliver [even] the guilty one,
c73378	who will be rescued through the purity of your hands.”
c73379	Then Job answered:
c73381	“Even today my complaint is bitter.
c73382	His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
c73383	If only
c73384	I knew
c73385	where to find Him,
c73386	so that I could go to His seat.
c73387	I would plead my case before Him
c73388	and fill my mouth with arguments.
c73389	I would learn how
c73390	He would answer,
c73391	and consider
c73392	what He would say.
c73393	Would He contend with me in His great power?
c73394	No,
c73395	He would certainly take [note] of me.
c73396	Then an upright man could reason with Him,
c73397	and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
c73398	If I go east,
c73399	He is not there,
c73400	and if I go west,
c73401	I cannot find Him.
c73402	in the north,
c73403	When He is at work
c73404	I cannot behold [Him];
c73405	when He turns to the south,
c73406	I cannot see [Him].
c73407	Yet He knows the way I have taken;
c73408	when He has tested me,
c73409	I will come forth as gold.
c73410	My feet have followed in His tracks;
c73411	I have kept His way
c73412	without turning aside.
c73413	from the command of His lips;
c73414	I have not departed
c73415	I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.
c73416	But He is unchangeable,
c73417	and who can oppose Him?
c73418	what He desires.
c73419	He does
c73420	For He carries out His decree against me,
c73421	and He has many such plans.
c73422	Therefore I am terrified in His presence;
c73423	when I consider this,
c73424	I fear Him.
c73425	God has made my heart faint;
c73426	the Almighty has terrified me.
c73427	Yet I am not silenced by the darkness,
c73428	by the thick darkness that covers my face.
c73429	Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment?
c73430	Why may those who know Him never see His days?
c73431	Men move boundary stones;
c73432	stolen flocks.
c73433	they pasture
c73434	They drive away the donkey of the fatherless
c73435	and take the widow’s ox in pledge.
c73436	They push the needy off the road
c73437	and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
c73438	Indeed, [like] wild donkeys in the desert,
c73439	the poor go to work
c73440	foraging for food;
c73441	the wasteland is food for their children.
c73442	They gather fodder in the fields
c73443	and glean the vineyards of the wicked.
c73444	Without clothing, they spend the night naked;
c73445	they have no covering against the cold.
c73446	Drenched by mountain rains,
c73447	they huddle against the rocks for want of shelter.
c73448	The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast;
c73449	the nursing child of the poor is seized for a debt.
c73450	Without clothing, they wander about naked.
c73451	They carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
c73452	They crush olives within their walls;
c73453	they tread the winepresses,
c73454	but go thirsty.
c73455	From the city, men groan,
c73456	and the souls of the wounded cry out,
c73457	yet God charges no one with wrongdoing.
c73458	Then there are those who rebel against the light,
c73459	not knowing its ways
c73460	or staying on its paths.
c73461	When daylight [is gone], the murderer rises
c73462	to kill the poor and needy;
c73463	in the night he is like a thief.
c73464	The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight.
c73465	Thinking,
c73466	‘No eye will see me,’
c73467	he covers his face.
c73468	In the dark they dig through houses;
c73469	by day they shut themselves in,
c73470	never to experience the light.
c73471	For to them, deep darkness is their morning;
c73472	surely they are friends with the terrors of darkness!
c73473	They are but foam on the surface of the water;
c73474	their portion of the land is cursed,
c73475	so that no one [would] turn into their vineyards.
c73476	As drought and heat consume the melting snow,
c73477	so Sheol
c73478	steals those who have sinned.
c73479	The womb forgets them;
c73480	the worm feeds on them;
c73481	they are remembered no more.
c73482	So injustice is like a broken tree.
c73483	They prey on the barren
c73484	and childless,
c73485	and show no kindness to the widow.
c73486	Yet by His power, God drags away the mighty.
c73487	though rising up,
c73488	they have no assurance of life.
c73489	He gives them a sense of security,
c73491	but His eyes are on their ways.
c73492	They are exalted for a moment,
c73493	then they are gone;
c73494	they are brought low
c73495	and gathered up like all others;
c73496	they are cut off like heads of grain.
c73497	If this is not so, then
c73498	who can prove me a liar
c73499	and reduce my words to nothing?”
c73500	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
c73502	“Dominion and awe belong to Him;
c73503	He establishes harmony in the heights of heaven.
c73504	Can His troops be numbered?
c73505	On whom does His light not rise?
c73506	How then can a man be just before God?
c73507	How can one born of woman be pure?
c73508	If even the moon
c73509	does not shine,
c73510	and the stars
c73511	are not pure in His sight,
c73512	how much less man,
c73513	who is but a maggot,
c73514	and the son of man,
c73515	who is but a worm!”
c73516	Then Job answered:
c73518	“How you have helped the powerless
c73519	and saved the arm that is feeble!
c73520	How you have counseled the unwise
c73521	and provided fully sound insight!
c73522	To whom have you uttered these words?
c73523	And whose spirit spoke through you?
c73524	The dead tremble— those who dwell beneath the waters.
c73525	Sheol is naked before Him,
c73526	and Abaddon has no covering.
c73527	He stretches out the north over empty space;
c73528	He hangs the earth upon nothing.
c73529	He wraps up the waters in His clouds,
c73530	yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight.
c73531	He covers the face of the full moon,
c73532	spreading His cloud over it.
c73533	He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
c73534	The foundations of heaven quake,
c73535	astounded at His rebuke.
c73536	By His power He stilled the sea,
c73537	and by His understanding He shattered Rahab.
c73538	By His breath the skies were cleared;
c73539	His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
c73540	Indeed, these [are] but the fringes of His ways;
c73541	how faint is the whisper we hear of Him!
c73542	Who then can understand the thunder of His power?”
c73543	Then Job continued
c73544	his discourse
c73545	and said:
c73546	“As surely as God lives,
c73547	who has deprived me of justice,
c73548	the Almighty,
c73549	who has embittered my soul,
c73550	as long as my breath is still within me
c73551	and the breath of God remains in my nostrils,
c73552	my lips will not speak wickedness,
c73553	and my tongue
c73554	will not utter deceit.
c73555	I will never
c73556	declare that you are right;
c73557	until I die.
c73558	I will maintain my integrity
c73559	I will hold fast my righteousness
c73560	and never let go.
c73561	As long as I live, my conscience will not accuse me.
c73562	May my enemy be like the wicked
c73563	and my opponent like the unjust.
c73564	For what hope has the godless
c73565	when he is cut off,
c73566	when God takes away his life?
c73567	Will God hear his cry
c73568	when distress comes upon him?
c73569	Will he delight in the Almighty?
c73570	Will he call upon God at all times?
c73571	I will instruct you in the power of God.
c73572	the ways of the Almighty.
c73573	I will not conceal
c73574	Surely ... for yourselves.
c73575	all of you have seen [it]
c73576	Why then do you keep up this empty talk?
c73577	This [is] the wicked man’s portion from God—
c73578	the heritage the ruthless
c73579	receive from the Almighty.
c73580	Though his sons are many,
c73581	they are destined for the sword;
c73582	and his offspring will never have enough food.
c73583	His survivors will be buried by the plague,
c73584	and their widows will not weep for them.
c73585	Though he heaps up silver like dust
c73586	and piles up a wardrobe like clay,
c73587	what he lays up,
c73588	the righteous will wear,
c73589	and his silver will be divided by the innocent.
c73590	The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon,
c73591	like a hut set up by a watchman.
c73592	He lies down wealthy,
c73593	but will do so no more;
c73594	when he opens his eyes,
c73595	all is gone.
c73596	Terrors overtake him like a flood;
c73597	a tempest sweeps him away in the night.
c73598	The east wind carries him away,
c73599	and he is gone;
c73600	it sweeps him out of his place.
c73601	It hurls against him
c73602	without mercy,
c73603	while he flees headlong from its power.
c73604	It claps its hands at him
c73605	and hisses him out of his place.
c73606	Surely there is a mine for silver
c73607	and a place where gold
c73608	is refined.
c73609	Iron is taken from the earth,
c73610	and copper is smelted from ore.
c73611	[Man] puts an end to the darkness;
c73612	he probes the farthest recesses for ore in deepest darkness.
c73613	he cuts a shaft
c73614	Far from human habitation
c73615	in places forgotten by the foot of man.
c73616	he dangles
c73617	Far from men ... and sways.
c73618	the earth,
c73619	Food may come from
c73620	but from below it is transformed as by fire.
c73621	Its rocks are the source of sapphires,
c73622	containing flecks of gold.
c73623	that path;
c73624	No bird of prey knows
c73625	no falcon’s eye has seen it.
c73626	Proud beasts have never trodden it;
c73627	no lion has ever prowled over it.
c73628	The miner strikes the flint;
c73629	he overturns mountains at their base.
c73630	He hews out channels in the rocks,
c73631	and his eyes spot every treasure.
c73632	He searches the sources of the streams
c73633	to bring what is hidden to light.
c73634	But where can wisdom be found,
c73635	and where does understanding dwell?
c73636	No man can know its value,
c73637	nor is it found in the land of the living.
c73638	The ocean depths say,
c73639	‘It [is] not in me,’
c73640	while the sea declares,
c73641	‘[It is] not with me.’
c73642	It cannot be purchased for gold,
c73643	nor its price weighed out in silver.
c73644	It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir,
c73645	in precious onyx or sapphire.
c73646	Neither gold nor crystal can compare,
c73647	nor jewels of fine gold be exchanged for it.
c73648	Coral and quartz are unworthy of mention;
c73649	the price of wisdom [is] beyond rubies.
c73650	Topaz from Cush cannot compare,
c73651	nor can it be valued in pure gold.
c73652	From where then does wisdom come,
c73653	and where does understanding dwell?
c73654	It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing
c73655	and concealed from the birds of the air.
c73656	Abaddon and Death say,
c73657	‘We have heard a rumor about it.’
c73658	But God understands its way,
c73659	and He knows its place.
c73660	For He looks to the ends of the earth
c73661	and sees everything under the heavens.
c73662	When God fixed the weight of the wind
c73663	and measured out the waters,
c73664	when He set a limit for the rain
c73665	and a path for the thunderbolt,
c73666	then He looked at [wisdom]
c73667	and appraised it;
c73668	He established it
c73669	and searched it out.
c73670	And He said to man,
c73671	‘Behold, the fear of the Lord,
c73672	that [is] wisdom,
c73674	and to turn away from evil
c73675	[is] understanding.’”
c73676	Again, Job continued
c73677	his discourse
c73678	and said:
c73679	“How I long for the months gone by, for the days
c73680	when God watched over me,
c73681	when His lamp shone above my head,
c73682	and by His light I walked through the darkness,
c73683	when I was in the days of my youth,
c73684	when the friendship of God rested on my tent,
c73685	when the Almighty was still with me
c73686	and my children were around me,
c73687	when my steps were bathed in cream
c73688	and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
c73689	When I went out to the city gate
c73690	and took my seat in the public square,
c73691	the young men saw me
c73692	and withdrew,
c73693	and the old men rose
c73694	to their feet.
c73695	The princes refrained from speaking
c73696	and covered their mouths with their hands.
c73697	The voices of the nobles were hushed,
c73698	and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.
c73699	For those who heard me
c73700	called me blessed,
c73701	and those who saw me
c73702	commended me,
c73703	because I rescued the poor
c73704	who cried out
c73705	and the fatherless
c73706	who had no helper.
c73707	The dying man blessed me,
c73708	and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.
c73709	I put on righteousness,
c73710	and it clothed me;
c73711	justice was my robe and turban.
c73712	I [served as] eyes to the blind
c73713	[and] as feet to the lame.
c73714	I was a father to the needy,
c73715	the case
c73716	of the stranger.
c73717	and I took up
c73718	I shattered the fangs of the unjust
c73719	and snatched the prey from his teeth.
c73720	So I thought:
c73721	‘I will die in my nest
c73722	and multiply my days as the sand.
c73723	My roots [will] spread out to the waters,
c73724	and the dew will rest nightly on my branches.
c73725	My glory is [ever] new within me,
c73726	and my bow is renewed in my hand.
c73727	Men listened to me
c73728	with expectation,
c73729	waiting silently for my counsel.
c73730	After my words, they spoke no more;
c73731	my speech settled on them like dew.
c73732	They waited for me as for rain
c73733	and drank in my words like spring showers.
c73734	If I smiled at them,
c73735	they did not believe it;
c73736	the light of my countenance was precious.
c73737	I chose their course
c73738	and presided as chief.
c73739	So I dwelt as a king among his troops,
c73740	as a comforter of mourners.
c73741	But now they mock me,
c73742	men younger than I am,
c73743	whose fathers I would have refused
c73744	to put with my sheep dogs.
c73745	Indeed, ... was the strength of their hands,
c73746	what use to me
c73747	since their vigor had left them?
c73748	Gaunt from poverty and hunger,
c73749	they gnawed the dry land,
c73750	and the desolate wasteland by night.
c73751	They plucked mallow among the shrubs,
c73752	and the roots of the broom tree were their food.
c73753	They were banished from among [men],
c73754	shouted down like thieves,
c73755	on the slopes of the wadis,
c73756	so that they lived
c73757	among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
c73758	They cried out among the shrubs
c73759	and huddled beneath the nettles.
c73760	A senseless
c73761	and nameless brood,
c73762	they were driven off the land.
c73763	And now they mock me in song;
c73764	I have become a byword among them.
c73765	They abhor me
c73766	and keep far
c73767	from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
c73768	Because God has unstrung my bow
c73769	and afflicted me,
c73770	they have cast off restraint in my presence.
c73771	The rabble arises at my right;
c73772	they lay snares for my feet
c73773	and build siege ramps against me.
c73774	They tear up my path;
c73775	they profit from my destruction,
c73776	with no one to restrain them.
c73777	They advance as through a gaping breach;
c73778	through the ruins they keep rolling in.
c73779	Terrors are turned loose against me;
c73780	they drive away my dignity as by the wind,
c73781	and my prosperity has passed like a cloud.
c73782	And now my soul is poured out within me;
c73783	days of suffering grip me.
c73784	Night pierces my bones,
c73785	and my gnawing pains never rest.
c73786	By great power He becomes like my garment;
c73787	He seizes me by the collar of my tunic.
c73788	He throws me into the mud,
c73789	and I have become like dust and ashes.
c73790	I cry out to You for help,
c73791	but You do not answer;
c73792	when I stand up,
c73793	You merely look at me.
c73794	You have ruthlessly turned on me;
c73795	You oppose me with Your strong hand.
c73796	You snatch me up into the wind
c73797	and drive me [before it];
c73798	You toss me about in the storm.
c73799	Yes, I know that
c73800	You will bring me down [to] death,
c73801	to the place appointed for all the living.
c73802	Yet no one stretches out his hand to a ruined man
c73803	when he cries for help in his distress.
c73804	Have I not wept for those in trouble?
c73805	Has my soul not grieved for the needy?
c73806	But when I hoped for good,
c73807	evil came;
c73808	when I looked for light,
c73809	darkness came.
c73810	I am churning within
c73811	and cannot rest;
c73812	days of affliction confront me.
c73813	I go about blackened, but not by the sun.
c73814	I stand up
c73815	in the assembly and cry for help.
c73816	I have become a brother to jackals,
c73817	and a companion of ostriches.
c73818	My skin grows black and peels,
c73819	and my bones burn with fever.
c73820	My harp is tuned to mourning
c73821	and my flute to the sound of weeping.
c73822	I have made a covenant with my eyes.
c73823	How then could I gaze [with desire] at a virgin?
c73824	For what [is] the allotment of God from above,
c73825	or the heritage from the Almighty on high?
c73826	Does not disaster come to the unjust
c73827	and calamity to workers of iniquity?
c73828	Does He not see my ways
c73829	and count my every step?
c73830	If I have walked in falsehood
c73831	or my foot has rushed to deceit,
c73832	let God weigh me with honest scales,
c73833	and He will know my integrity.
c73834	If my steps have turned from the path,
c73835	if my heart has followed my eyes,
c73836	or impurity has stuck to my hands,
c73837	what I have sown,
c73838	then may another eat
c73839	and my crops be uprooted.
c73840	If my heart has been enticed by ... wife,
c73841	my neighbor’s ... or I have lurked at his door,
c73842	then may my own wife grind grain for another,
c73843	and may other men sleep with her.
c73844	For that [would be] a heinous crime,
c73845	an iniquity
c73846	to be judged.
c73847	For it is a fire
c73848	that burns down to Abaddon;
c73849	it would root out my entire harvest.
c73850	If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant when they made a complaint against me,
c73851	what will I do
c73852	when God rises to judge?
c73853	when called to account?
c73854	How will I answer
c73855	Did not He who made me in the womb also make them?
c73856	Did not the same One form us in the womb?
c73857	If I have denied the desires of the poor
c73858	or allowed the widow’s eyes to fail,
c73859	if I have eaten my morsel alone,
c73860	not sharing it with the fatherless—
c73861	though from my youth I reared him as would a father,
c73862	and from my mother's womb I guided [the widow]—
c73863	if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing,
c73864	or a needy man without a cloak,
c73865	if his heart has not blessed me
c73866	for warming him with the fleece of my sheep,
c73867	if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless
c73868	because I saw that I had support in the gate,
c73869	fall from my shoulder
c73870	then may my arm ... and be torn from its socket.
c73871	For calamity from God terrifies me,
c73872	and His splendor I cannot overpower.
c73873	If I have put my trust in gold
c73874	or called pure gold
c73875	my security,
c73876	if I have rejoiced
c73877	in my great wealth
c73878	because my hand had gained so much,
c73879	if I have regarded the sun
c73880	in its radiance
c73881	or at the moon moving in splendor,
c73882	so that my heart was secretly enticed
c73883	and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,
c73884	this would also be an iniquity
c73885	to be judged,
c73886	for I would have denied God on high.
c73887	If I have rejoiced at my enemy’s ruin,
c73888	or exulted
c73889	when evil befell him—
c73890	I have not allowed
c73891	to sin
c73892	my mouth
c73893	by asking for his life with a curse—
c73894	if the men of my house have not said,
c73895	‘Who is there
c73896	who has not had his fill?’—
c73897	[but] no stranger had to lodge on the street,
c73898	for my door has been open to the traveler—
c73899	if I have covered my transgressions like Adam
c73900	by hiding my guilt in my heart,
c73901	because I greatly feared the crowds,
c73902	and the contempt of the clans terrified me,
c73903	so that I kept silent
c73904	and would not go outside—
c73905	Oh, that I had one to hear me!
c73906	Here is my signature—
c73907	let the Almighty answer me;
c73908	let my accuser compose His indictment.
c73909	Surely I would carry it on my shoulder
c73910	and wear it like a crown.
c73911	I would give account of all my steps;
c73912	I would approach Him like a prince.
c73913	If my land cries out against me
c73914	and its furrows weep together,
c73915	if I have devoured its produce without payment
c73916	or broken the spirit of its tenants,
c73917	then let briers grow instead of wheat
c73918	and stinkweed instead of barley.”
c73919	Thus conclude the words of Job.
c73920	So these three men stopped
c73921	answering Job,
c73922	because he was righteous in his own eyes.
c73923	This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram,
c73924	who burned with anger against Job
c73925	for justifying himself rather than God.
c73926	And his anger burned against Job’s three friends,
c73927	because they had failed to refute [Job],
c73928	and yet had condemned him.
c73929	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job
c73930	because the others were older than he.
c73931	But when he saw
c73932	that the three men had no further reply,
c73933	his anger was aroused.
c73934	So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared:
c73936	“I am young in years,
c73937	while you are old;
c73938	that is why I was timid
c73939	and afraid
c73940	to tell you what I know.
c73941	I thought
c73942	that age should speak,
c73943	and many years should teach wisdom.
c73944	But
c73945	[there is] a spirit in a man,
c73946	the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.
c73947	It is not only the old who are wise,
c73948	or the elderly who understand justice.
c73949	Therefore I say,
c73950	‘Listen to me.
c73951	I too will declare what I know.’
c73952	Indeed, I waited while you spoke;
c73953	I listened to your reasoning;
c73954	as you searched for words,
c73955	I paid you full attention.
c73957	But no one
c73958	proved Job wrong;
c73959	you rebutted his arguments.
c73960	not one of
c73961	So do not claim,
c73962	‘We have found wisdom;
c73963	let God, ... refute him.’
c73964	not man,
c73965	But Job has not directed [his] words against me,
c73966	and I will not answer him with your arguments.
c73967	Job’s friends are dismayed
c73968	and have no more to say;
c73969	words have escaped them.
c73970	Must I wait
c73971	now that they are silent,
c73972	now that they stand
c73973	and no longer reply?
c73974	I too will answer;
c73975	yes, I will declare what I know.
c73976	For I am full of words,
c73977	and my spirit within me compels me.
c73978	Behold, my belly ... wine;
c73979	is like unvented
c73980	it is about to burst like a new wineskin.
c73981	I must speak
c73982	and find relief;
c73983	I must open my lips
c73984	and respond.
c73985	I will be partial to no one,
c73986	nor will I flatter any man.
c73987	For I do not know how
c73988	to flatter,
c73989	or my Maker would remove me in an instant.
c73990	But
c73991	now, ... hear
c73992	Job,
c73993	my speech,
c73994	and listen to all my words.
c73995	Behold now, I will open my mouth;
c73996	what I speak is on the tip of my tongue.
c73997	My words are from an upright heart,
c73998	and my lips speak sincerely what I know.
c73999	The Spirit of God has made me,
c74000	and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
c74001	me if you can;
c74002	Refute
c74003	prepare your case and confront me.
c74005	I am just like you before God;
c74006	I was also formed out of clay.
c74007	Surely no fear of me should terrify you;
c74008	nor will my hand be heavy upon you.
c74009	Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
c74010	and I have heard these very words:
c74011	‘I am pure,
c74012	without transgression;
c74013	I am clean,
c74014	with no iniquity in me.
c74015	Yet He finds occasions against me;
c74016	He counts me as His enemy.
c74017	He puts my feet in the stocks;
c74018	He watches over all my paths.’
c74019	Behold, you are not right in this matter.
c74020	I will answer you,
c74021	for God is greater than man.
c74022	Why do you contend with Him
c74023	that He answers nothing a man asks?
c74024	For God speaks in one [way]
c74025	and in another,
c74026	[yet] no one notices.
c74027	In a dream, in a vision in the night,
c74028	when deep sleep falls upon men
c74029	as they slumber on their beds,
c74030	He opens their ears at that time
c74031	and terrifies them with warnings,
c74032	in order to turn a man from wrongdoing
c74033	and keep him from pride,
c74034	to preserve his soul from the Pit,
c74035	and his life
c74036	from perishing by the sword.
c74037	A man is also chastened on his bed with pain
c74038	and constant distress in his bones,
c74039	so that he detests his bread,
c74040	and his soul [loathes] his favorite food.
c74041	His flesh wastes away from sight,
c74042	bones protrude.
c74043	and his hidden
c74044	He draws near to the Pit,
c74045	and his life to the messengers of death.
c74046	Yet if there is a messenger on his side, one mediator out of a thousand,
c74047	to tell a man what is right for him,
c74048	to be gracious
c74049	to him and say,
c74050	‘Spare him
c74051	from going down to the Pit;
c74052	I have found his ransom,’
c74053	then his flesh will be renewed like a child’s,
c74054	and he will return to the days of his youth.
c74055	He will pray to God
c74056	and find favor;
c74057	he will see His face and shout for joy,
c74058	and God will restore the righteousness of that man.
c74059	Then he will sing before men
c74060	with these words:
c74061	‘I have sinned
c74062	and perverted what was right;
c74063	yet I did not get what I deserved.
c74064	He redeemed my soul
c74065	from going down to the Pit,
c74066	and I will live to see the light.’
c74067	Behold, all these things God does to a man, two or even three times,
c74068	to bring back his soul from the Pit,
c74069	that he may be enlightened with the light of life.
c74070	Pay attention,
c74071	Job,
c74072	and listen to me;
c74073	be silent,
c74074	and I will speak.
c74075	But if you have something to say,
c74076	answer me;
c74077	speak up,
c74078	for I would like
c74079	to vindicate you.
c74080	But if not,
c74081	then listen to me;
c74082	be quiet,
c74083	and I will teach you wisdom.”
c74084	Then Elihu continued
c74085	and said:
c74086	“Hear
c74087	you wise men;
c74088	my words,
c74089	you men of learning.
c74090	give ear to me,
c74091	For the ear tests words
c74092	as the mouth tastes
c74093	food.
c74094	Let us choose for ourselves what is right;
c74095	let us learn together
c74096	what is good.
c74097	For Job has declared,
c74098	‘I am righteous,
c74099	yet God has deprived me of justice.
c74100	Would I lie about my case?
c74101	My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’
c74102	What man is like Job,
c74103	[who] drinks up derision like water?
c74104	He keeps company with evildoers
c74105	and walks with wicked men.
c74106	For he has said,
c74107	‘It profits a man nothing
c74108	that he should delight in God.’
c74109	Therefore
c74110	you men of understanding.
c74111	listen to me,
c74112	Far be it from God to do wrong,
c74113	and for the Almighty to act unjustly.
c74114	For according to a man's deeds, He repays him;
c74115	according to a man's ways, He brings consequences.
c74116	Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly
c74117	and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
c74118	Who gave Him charge over the earth?
c74119	Who appointed [Him] [over] the whole world?
c74120	If He were to set His heart to it
c74121	and withdraw His Spirit and breath,
c74122	all flesh would perish together
c74123	and mankind would return to the dust.
c74124	If you have understanding,
c74125	hear this;
c74126	listen to my words.
c74127	Could one who hates justice govern?
c74128	Will you condemn the just and mighty One,
c74129	who says to kings,
c74130	‘[You are] worthless!’
c74131	‘[You are] wicked,’
c74132	and to nobles,
c74133	who is not partial to princes
c74134	and does not favor rich over poor?
c74135	For they are all the work of His hands.
c74136	They die in a moment,
c74137	and at midnight; the people convulse
c74138	and pass away;
c74139	the mighty are removed
c74140	without human hand.
c74141	For His eyes [are] on the ways of man,
c74142	and He sees his every step.
c74143	There is no darkness
c74144	[or] deep shadow
c74145	where the workers of iniquity can hide.
c74146	For ... need not examine a man further,
c74147	God ... for one to approach Him in judgment.
c74148	He shatters the mighty without inquiry
c74149	and sets up others in their place.
c74150	Therefore, He recognizes their deeds;
c74151	He overthrows [them] in the night
c74152	and they are crushed.
c74153	He strikes them for their wickedness in full view,
c74154	because they turned aside from Him
c74155	and had no regard for any of His ways.
c74156	They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him,
c74157	and He heard the outcry of the afflicted.
c74158	But when He remains silent,
c74159	who can condemn Him?
c74160	When He hides His face,
c74161	who can see Him?
c74162	Yet He watches over both man and nation,
c74163	that godless men should not rule or lay snares for the people.
c74164	Suppose
c74165	to God,
c74166	someone says
c74167	‘I have endured my punishment;
c74168	I will offend no more.
c74169	me what I cannot see;
c74170	Teach
c74171	if I have done wrong,
c74172	I will not do it again.’
c74173	Should God repay you on your own terms
c74174	when you have disavowed His?
c74175	You must choose,
c74176	not I;
c74178	what you know.
c74179	so tell me
c74180	Men of understanding will declare to me,
c74181	and the wise men
c74182	who hear me [will say]:
c74183	‘Job speaks without knowledge;
c74184	his words lack
c74185	insight.’
c74186	If only
c74187	Job were tried to the utmost for answering like a wicked man.
c74188	For he adds rebellion to his sin;
c74189	he claps [his hands] among us
c74190	and multiplies his words against God.
c74191	And Elihu went on
c74192	to say:
c74193	“Do you think it is just
c74194	when you say,
c74195	‘I am righteous before God.’?
c74196	For you ask,
c74197	‘What does it profit me,
c74198	and what benefit do I gain apart from sin?’
c74199	I will answer you
c74200	and your friends with you.
c74201	Look to the heavens
c74202	and see;
c74203	gaze at the clouds
c74204	high above you.
c74205	If you sin,
c74206	what do you accomplish against Him?
c74207	If you multiply your transgressions,
c74208	what do you do to Him?
c74209	If you are righteous,
c74210	what do you give Him,
c74211	or what does He receive from your hand?
c74212	Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself,
c74213	and your righteousness only a son of men.
c74214	Men cry out under great oppression;
c74215	they plead for relief from the arm of the mighty.
c74216	But no one asks,
c74217	‘Where [is] God my Maker,
c74218	who gives us songs in the night,
c74219	who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth
c74220	and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?’
c74221	There they cry out,
c74222	but He does not answer, because of the pride of evil men.
c74223	Surely God does not listen to empty pleas,
c74224	and the Almighty does not take note of it.
c74225	How much less, then, when you say
c74226	that you do not see Him,
c74227	that your case is before Him
c74228	and you must wait for Him,
c74229	and further,
c74230	that [in] His anger He has not punished
c74231	[or] taken much notice of folly.
c74232	So Job opens his mouth in vain
c74233	and multiplies words without knowledge.”
c74234	And Elihu continued
c74235	and said:
c74236	“Bear with me a little longer,
c74237	and I will show you
c74238	that there is more to be said on God’s behalf.
c74239	I get my knowledge from afar,
c74240	and I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
c74241	For truly my arguments are free of falsehood;
c74242	one perfect in knowledge is with you.
c74243	Indeed God [is] mighty,
c74244	but He despises no one;
c74245	[He is] mighty in strength of understanding.
c74246	He does not keep the wicked alive,
c74247	but He grants justice to the afflicted.
c74248	He does not take His eyes off the righteous,
c74249	but He enthrones them with kings
c74250	forever.
c74251	and exalts them
c74252	And if men are bound with chains,
c74253	caught in cords of affliction,
c74254	then He tells them their deeds ... they have transgressed.
c74255	and how arrogantly
c74256	He opens their ears to correction
c74257	and commands
c74258	that they turn from iniquity.
c74259	If they obey
c74260	and serve [Him],
c74261	they will end their days in prosperity
c74262	and their years in happiness.
c74263	But if they do not obey,
c74264	they will perish by the sword
c74265	and die without knowledge.
c74266	The godless in heart harbor resentment;
c74267	they do not cry for help.
c74268	even when He binds them,
c74269	They die in their youth;
c74270	and their life [ends] among the male cult prostitutes.
c74271	God rescues the afflicted by their affliction
c74272	and opens their ears in oppression.
c74273	Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress ... and broad place,
c74274	to a spacious
c74275	to a table full of richness.
c74276	But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked;
c74277	judgment and justice have seized you.
c74278	Be careful
c74279	that no one lures you with riches;
c74280	do not let a large bribe lead you astray.
c74281	Can your wealth ... keep
c74282	you from distress?
c74283	or all your mighty effort
c74284	Do not long for the night,
c74285	when people vanish from their homes.
c74286	Be careful
c74287	not to turn to iniquity,
c74288	for this you have preferred to affliction.
c74289	Behold, God is exalted in His power.
c74290	Who is a teacher like Him?
c74291	Who has appointed His way for Him,
c74292	or told Him,
c74293	‘You have done wrong’?
c74294	Remember
c74295	to magnify His work,
c74296	which men have praised in song.
c74297	All mankind has seen it;
c74298	men behold it from afar.
c74299	Indeed, God [is] great—
c74300	beyond our knowledge; the number of His years
c74301	is unsearchable.
c74302	For He draws up drops of water
c74303	which distill the rain from the mist,
c74304	which the clouds pour out
c74305	and shower abundantly on mankind.
c74306	Furthermore, who can understand how the clouds spread out,
c74307	how the thunder roars from His pavilion?
c74308	See how He scatters His lightning around Him
c74309	and covers the depths of the sea.
c74310	For by these He judges the nations
c74311	and provides food in abundance.
c74312	He fills His hands with lightning
c74313	and commands it to strike its mark.
c74314	The thunder declares [His presence];
c74315	even the cattle regard the rising [storm].
c74316	At this my heart also pounds
c74317	and leaps from its place.
c74318	Listen closely to the thunder of His voice
c74319	and the rumbling [that] comes from His mouth.
c74320	He unleashes ... beneath the whole sky
c74321	His lightning ... and sends it to the ends of the earth.
c74322	Then there comes a roaring sound;
c74323	He thunders with His majestic voice.
c74324	He does not restrain [the lightning]
c74325	when His voice resounds.
c74326	God thunders wondrously with His voice;
c74327	He does great things
c74328	we cannot comprehend.
c74329	For He says to the snow,
c74330	‘Fall [on] the earth,’
c74331	and to the gentle rain, ‘Pour out a mighty downpour.’
c74332	He seals up the hand of every man,
c74333	so that all men may know His work.
c74334	The wild animals enter their lairs;
c74335	they settle down in their dens.
c74336	The tempest comes from its chamber,
c74337	and the cold from the driving north winds.
c74338	By the breath of God the ice is formed
c74339	and the watery expanses are frozen.
c74340	He loads the clouds with moisture;
c74341	He scatters His lightning through them.
c74342	They swirl about, turning round and round at His direction,
c74343	accomplishing
c74344	all
c74345	that He commands
c74346	over the face of all the earth.
c74347	Whether for punishment
c74348	or for His land,
c74349	He accomplishes this in His loving devotion.
c74350	Listen to this,
c74351	Job;
c74352	stand still
c74353	and consider the wonders of God.
c74354	Do you know
c74355	how God dispatches
c74356	the clouds or makes the lightning flash?
c74357	Do you understand how the clouds float,
c74358	those wonders of Him who is perfect in knowledge?
c74359	You whose clothes get hot
c74360	when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
c74361	can you, like Him, spread out the skies
c74362	to reflect the heat like a mirror of bronze?
c74363	Teach
c74364	us what we should say to Him;
c74365	we cannot draw up our case when our faces are in darkness.
c74366	Should He be told
c74367	that I want to speak?
c74368	Would a man ask
c74369	to be swallowed up?
c74370	Now
c74371	no one can gaze at the sun
c74372	[when] it [is] bright in the skies
c74373	after the wind has swept
c74374	them clean.
c74375	Out of the north He comes in golden [splendor];
c74376	awesome majesty surrounds Him.
c74377	The Almighty
c74378	is beyond our reach;
c74379	He is exalted in power!
c74380	In His justice and great righteousness, He does not oppress.
c74381	Therefore, men fear Him,
c74382	for He is not partial to the wise in heart.”
c74383	Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind
c74384	and said:
c74385	“Who is this who obscures My counsel by words without knowledge?
c74386	Now brace yourself like a man;
c74387	I will question you,
c74388	and you shall inform Me!
c74389	Where were you
c74390	when I laid the foundations of the earth?
c74391	Tell [Me],
c74392	if you have understanding.
c74393	Who fixed its measurements?
c74394	Surely you know!
c74395	Or who stretched a measuring line across it?
c74396	On what were its foundations laid,
c74397	or who set its core {in place}—
c74398	while the morning stars sang together
c74399	and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
c74400	Who enclosed the sea behind doors
c74401	when it burst forth
c74402	from the womb,
c74403	when I made the clouds its garment
c74404	and thick darkness its blanket,
c74405	when I fixed its boundaries
c74406	and set in place its bars and doors,
c74407	and I declared:
c74408	‘You may come this far,
c74409	but no farther;
c74410	here your proud waves must stop’?
c74411	In your days, have you commanded the morning
c74412	or assigned the dawn its place,
c74413	that it might spread to the ends of the earth
c74414	and shake the wicked out of it?
c74415	The earth takes shape like clay [under] a seal;
c74416	its hills stand out like the folds of a garment.
c74417	Light is withheld from the wicked,
c74418	and their upraised arm is broken.
c74419	Have you journeyed to the vents of the sea
c74420	or walked in the trenches of the deep?
c74421	Have the gates of death been revealed to you?
c74422	Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
c74423	Have you surveyed the extent of the earth?
c74424	Tell [Me],
c74425	if you know all this.
c74426	Where is the way
c74427	to the home of light?
c74428	darkness
c74429	Do you know where ... resides,
c74430	so you can lead it back to its border?
c74431	Do you know the paths to its home?
c74432	Surely you know,
c74433	for you were already born!
c74434	And the number of your days is great!
c74435	Have you entered the storehouses of snow
c74436	or observed the storehouses of hail,
c74437	which I hold in reserve for times of trouble,
c74438	for the day of war and battle?
c74439	In which direction
c74440	is the lightning dispersed,
c74441	or the east wind scattered over the earth?
c74442	Who cuts a channel for the flood
c74443	or clears a path for the thunderbolt,
c74444	to bring rain on ... land,
c74445	a barren
c74446	on a desert
c74447	where no man [lives],
c74448	to satisfy the parched wasteland
c74449	and make it sprout with tender grass?
c74450	Does the rain have a father?
c74451	Who has begotten the drops of dew?
c74452	From whose womb does the ice emerge?
c74453	the frost from heaven,
c74454	Who gave birth to
c74455	when the waters become hard as stone,
c74456	and the surface of the deep is frozen?
c74457	Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades
c74458	or loosen the belt of Orion?
c74459	Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons
c74460	the Bear and her cubs?
c74461	or lead out
c74462	Do you know the laws of the heavens?
c74463	Can you set their dominion over the earth?
c74464	Can you command the clouds
c74465	so that a flood of water covers you?
c74466	Can you send the lightning bolts
c74467	on their way?
c74468	Do they report to you,
c74469	‘Here we are’?
c74470	Who has put wisdom in the heart
c74471	or given understanding to the mind?
c74472	Who has the wisdom to count the clouds?
c74474	the water jars of the heavens
c74475	Or who can tilt
c74476	when the dust hardens into a mass
c74477	and the clods of earth stick together?
c74478	Can you hunt the prey for a lioness
c74479	or satisfy the hunger of young lions
c74480	when they crouch in their dens
c74481	and lie in wait in the thicket?
c74482	Who provides food for the raven
c74483	when its young cry out to God
c74484	as they wander about for lack of food?
c74485	Do you know when mountain goats give birth?
c74486	the doe bear her fawn?
c74487	Have you watched
c74488	Can you count the months
c74489	they are pregnant?
c74490	Do you know the time
c74491	they give birth?
c74492	They crouch down
c74493	and bring forth their young;
c74494	they deliver their newborn.
c74495	Their young ones thrive
c74496	and grow up in the open field;
c74497	they leave
c74498	and do not return.
c74499	Who set the wild donkey free?
c74501	the swift donkey from the harness?
c74502	Who released
c74503	I made the wilderness his home
c74504	and the salt flats his dwelling.
c74505	He scorns the tumult of the city
c74506	and never hears the shouts of a driver.
c74507	He roams the mountains for pasture,
c74508	searching for any green thing.
c74509	Will the wild ox consent
c74510	to serve you?
c74511	Will he stay by your manger {at night}?
c74512	Can you hold [him] to the furrow with a harness?
c74513	Will he plow the valleys behind you?
c74514	Can you rely on his
c74515	great strength?
c74516	Will you leave your hard work to him?
c74517	Can you trust him
c74518	to bring in your grain
c74519	and gather it to your threshing floor?
c74520	The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully,
c74521	but cannot [match] the pinions and feathers of the stork.
c74522	For she leaves her eggs on the ground
c74523	and lets them warm in the sand.
c74524	She forgets
c74525	that a foot may crush them,
c74526	or a wild animal may trample them.
c74527	She treats her young harshly,
c74528	as if not her own,
c74529	with no concern that her labor was in vain.
c74530	For God has deprived her of wisdom;
c74531	He has not endowed her with understanding.
c74532	Yet when
c74533	she proudly spreads her wings,
c74534	she laughs at the horse and its rider.
c74535	Do you give strength to the horse
c74536	or adorn his neck with a mane?
c74537	Do you make him leap like a locust,
c74538	[striking] terror with his proud snorting?
c74539	He paws in the valley
c74540	and rejoices in his strength;
c74541	he charges
c74542	into battle.
c74543	He laughs at fear,
c74544	frightened of nothing;
c74545	he does not turn back from the sword.
c74546	A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and lance.
c74547	Trembling with excitement, he devours the distance;
c74548	he cannot stand still
c74549	when the trumpet sounds.
c74550	At the [blast of] the trumpet, he snorts
c74551	with fervor!
c74552	He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shouts of captains and the cry of battle.
c74553	Does the hawk take flight by your understanding
c74554	and spread his wings toward the south?
c74555	Does the eagle soar at your command
c74556	and make his nest on high?
c74557	He dwells on a cliff
c74558	and lodges there; his stronghold is on a rocky crag.
c74559	From there he spies out food;
c74560	his eyes see [it] from afar.
c74561	His young ones feast on blood;
c74562	and where the slain [are],
c74563	there he [is].”
c74564	And the LORD said to Job:
c74566	“Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty?
c74567	Let him who argues with God
c74568	give an answer.”
c74569	Then Job answered the LORD:
c74571	“Behold, I am insignificant.
c74572	How can I reply to You?
c74573	I place my hand over my mouth.
c74574	I have spoken once,
c74575	but I have no answer—
c74576	twice,
c74577	but I have nothing to add.”
c74578	Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind
c74579	and said:
c74580	“Now brace yourself like a man;
c74581	I will question you,
c74582	and you shall answer Me.
c74583	Would you really annul My justice?
c74584	Would you condemn Me
c74585	to justify yourself?
c74586	Do you have an arm like God’s?
c74587	Can you thunder with a voice like His?
c74588	Then adorn yourself [with] majesty and splendor,
c74589	and clothe yourself with honor and glory.
c74590	Unleash the fury of your wrath;
c74591	look on every proud man
c74592	and bring him low.
c74593	Look on every proud man
c74594	and humble him;
c74595	trample the wicked where they stand.
c74596	Bury them together in the dust;
c74597	imprison them in the grave.
c74598	Then I will confess to you
c74599	that your own right hand can save you.
c74600	Look at Behemoth,
c74601	which I made [along] with you.
c74602	He feeds on grass like an ox.
c74603	See the strength of his loins
c74604	and the power in the muscles of his belly.
c74605	His tail sways like a cedar;
c74606	the sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.
c74607	His bones are tubes of bronze;
c74608	his limbs are rods of iron.
c74609	He is the foremost of God’s works;
c74610	only his Maker
c74611	can draw the sword against him.
c74612	The hills yield him their produce,
c74613	while all the beasts of the field play nearby.
c74614	He lies under the lotus plants, hidden among the reeds of the marsh.
c74615	The lotus plants conceal him
c74616	in their shade;
c74617	the willows of the brook surround him.
c74618	Though the river rages,
c74619	Behemoth is unafraid;
c74620	he remains secure,
c74621	though the Jordan surges to his mouth.
c74622	Can anyone capture him as he looks on,
c74623	or pierce his nose with a snare?
c74624	Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook
c74625	or tie down his tongue with a rope?
c74626	Can you put a cord through his nose
c74627	or pierce his jaw with a hook?
c74628	Will he beg you for mercy
c74629	or speak to you softly?
c74630	Will he make a covenant with you
c74631	to take him as a slave for life?
c74632	Can you pet him like a bird
c74633	or put him on a leash for your maidens?
c74634	Will traders barter for him
c74635	or divide him among the merchants?
c74636	Can you fill his hide with harpoons
c74637	or his head with fishing spears?
c74638	If you lay a hand on him,
c74639	you will remember the battle
c74640	and never repeat it!
c74641	Surely hope of [overcoming] him is false.
c74642	Is not the sight of him overwhelming?
c74643	No one is ferocious
c74644	enough to rouse Leviathan.
c74645	Then who
c74646	is able to stand against Me?
c74647	Who has given to Me
c74648	that I should repay him?
c74649	Everything under heaven
c74650	is Mine.
c74651	I cannot keep silent about his limbs, his power and his graceful form.
c74652	Who can strip off his outer coat?
c74653	with a bridle?
c74654	Who can approach [him]
c74655	his jaws,
c74656	Who can open
c74657	ringed by his fearsome teeth?
c74658	[His] rows of scales are [his] pride,
c74659	tightly sealed together.
c74660	One scale ... to another
c74661	is so near
c74662	that no air can pass between them.
c74663	to one another;
c74664	They are joined
c74665	they clasp
c74666	and cannot be separated.
c74667	His snorting flashes with light,
c74668	and his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
c74669	Firebrands stream from his mouth;
c74670	fiery sparks shoot forth!
c74671	Smoke billows from his nostrils
c74672	as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.
c74673	His breath sets coals ablaze,
c74674	and flames pour out of his mouth.
c74675	Strength resides in his neck,
c74676	and dismay leaps before him.
c74677	The folds of his flesh are tightly joined;
c74678	they are firm
c74679	and immovable.
c74680	His chest is as hard as a rock,
c74681	as hard as a lower millstone!
c74682	When Leviathan rises up, the mighty are terrified;
c74683	they withdraw before his thrashing.
c74684	The sword that reaches him
c74685	has no effect,
c74686	nor does the spear or dart or arrow.
c74687	He regards iron as straw
c74688	and bronze as rotten wood.
c74689	No arrow can make him flee;
c74690	slingstones become like chaff to him.
c74691	A club is regarded as straw,
c74692	and he laughs at the sound of the lance.
c74693	His undersides are jagged potsherds,
c74694	spreading out the mud like a threshing sledge.
c74695	He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron;
c74696	he makes the sea like a jar of ointment.
c74697	He leaves a glistening wake behind him;
c74698	one would think the deep had white hair!
c74699	Nothing on earth is his equal—
c74700	a creature devoid of fear!
c74701	He looks down ... the haughty; ... all
c74702	on all ... he is king over ... the proud.”
c74703	Then Job replied to the LORD:
c74705	“I know
c74706	that You can do all things
c74707	and that no plan of Yours can be thwarted.
c74708	You asked, ‘Who is this who conceals My counsel without knowledge?’
c74709	Surely I spoke of things
c74710	I did not understand,
c74711	things too wonderful for
c74712	me to know.
c74713	You said, ‘Listen now,
c74714	and I will speak.
c74715	I will question you,
c74716	and you shall answer Me.’
c74717	My ears had heard of You,
c74718	but now my eyes have seen You.
c74719	Therefore I retract [my words],
c74720	and I repent in dust and ashes.”
c74722	After the LORD had spoken these words to Job,
c74723	He said to Eliphaz the Temanite,
c74724	“My wrath is kindled against you and your two friends.
c74725	For you have not spoken about Me accurately, as My servant Job has.
c74726	So now,
c74727	take seven bulls and seven rams,
c74728	go to My servant Job,
c74729	and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves.
c74730	Then My servant Job will pray for you,
c74731	for I will accept his prayer
c74732	and not deal with you [according to your] folly.
c74733	For you have not spoken accurately about Me, as My servant Job has.”
c74734	So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went
c74735	and did
c74736	as the LORD had told them;
c74737	and the LORD accepted Job’s request.
c74738	After Job ... the LORD restored his prosperity
c74739	had prayed for his friends,
c74740	and doubled ... former possessions.
c74741	his
c74743	All his brothers and sisters and prior acquaintances came ... all
c74744	and dined with him in his house.
c74745	They consoled him
c74746	and comforted him over ... the adversity
c74747	that the LORD had brought upon him.
c74748	one gave him
c74749	And each ... a piece of silver
c74750	and a gold ring.
c74751	So the LORD blessed Job's latter [days] more than his first.
c74752	He owned 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
c74753	And he also had seven sons and three daughters.
c74754	He named his first daughter Jemimah,
c74755	his second Keziah,
c74756	and his third Keren-happuch.
c74757	No women as beautiful as Job’s daughters could be found in all the land,
c74758	and their father granted them an inheritance among their brothers.
c74759	After this, Job lived 140 years
c74760	and saw his children and their children
c74761	to the fourth generation.
c74762	And so Job died, old and full of years.
c74763	The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
c74764	To know wisdom and discipline,
c74765	to comprehend the words of insight,
c74766	to receive instruction in wise living,
c74767	in righteousness, justice, and equity,
c74768	to impart prudence to the simple,
c74769	knowledge and discretion to the young—
c74770	{let} the wise listen
c74771	and gain instruction,
c74772	and the discerning acquire wise counsel—
c74773	to understand the proverbs and parables,
c74774	the sayings and riddles of the wise.
c74775	The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of knowledge,
c74776	[but] fools despise wisdom and discipline.
c74777	Listen,
c74778	my son,
c74779	to your father’s instruction,
c74780	and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.
c74781	For they [are] a garland of grace on your head,
c74782	and a pendant around your neck.
c74783	My son,
c74784	if sinners entice you,
c74785	do not yield [to them].
c74786	If they say,
c74787	“Come along,
c74788	let us lie in wait for blood,
c74789	let us ambush the innocent without cause,
c74790	let us swallow them alive like Sheol,
c74791	and whole like those descending into the Pit.
c74792	We {will} find all manner of precious goods;
c74793	we {will} fill our houses with plunder.
c74794	Throw in your lot with us,
c74795	let us all have one purse”—
c74796	my son,
c74797	do not walk the road with them
c74798	or set foot upon their path.
c74799	For their feet run to evil,
c74800	and they are swift
c74801	to shed blood.
c74802	How futile to spread the net where any bird can see it.
c74803	But they lie in wait for their [own] blood;
c74804	they ambush their [own] lives.
c74805	Such [is] the fate of all
c74806	who are greedy, whose unjust gain
c74807	takes the lives of its possessors.
c74808	Wisdom calls out in the street,
c74809	she lifts her voice in the square,
c74810	in the main concourse she cries aloud,
c74811	at the city gates she makes her speech:
c74812	“How long,
c74813	O simple ones,
c74814	will you love simplicity?
c74815	How long will scoffers delight in their scorn
c74816	and fools hate knowledge?
c74817	If you had repented at my rebuke,
c74818	then surely I would have poured out my spirit on you;
c74819	I would have made my words known to you.
c74820	Because ... my call,
c74821	you refused
c74822	my outstretched hand,
c74823	and no one took
c74824	because you neglected all my counsel,
c74825	and wanted none of my correction,
c74826	in turn I will mock your calamity;
c74827	I will sneer
c74828	when terror strikes you,
c74829	when your dread comes like a storm,
c74830	and your destruction like a whirlwind,
c74831	when distress and anguish overwhelm you.
c74832	Then they will call on me,
c74833	but I will not answer;
c74834	they {will} earnestly seek me,
c74835	but {will} not find me.
c74836	For they hated knowledge
c74837	and chose not to fear the LORD.
c74838	They accepted none of my counsel;
c74839	they despised all my reproof.
c74840	So they {will} eat the fruit of their own way,
c74841	and be filled with their own devices.
c74842	For the waywardness of the simple {will} slay them,
c74843	and the complacency of fools {will} destroy them.
c74845	But whoever listens to me
c74846	{will} dwell in safety,
c74847	secure from the fear of evil.”
c74848	My son,
c74849	if you accept my words
c74850	and hide my commandments within you,
c74851	if you incline your ear to wisdom
c74852	and direct your heart to understanding,
c74853	truly
c74854	if you ... call out to insight
c74855	and lift your voice to understanding,
c74856	if you seek it like silver
c74857	and search it out like hidden treasure,
c74858	then you will discern the fear of the LORD
c74859	and discover the knowledge of God.
c74860	For the LORD gives wisdom;
c74861	from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
c74862	He stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
c74863	He is a shield to those who walk with integrity,
c74864	to guard the paths of justice
c74865	and protect the way of His saints.
c74866	Then you will discern righteousness and justice
c74867	and equity— every good path.
c74868	For wisdom will enter your heart,
c74869	and knowledge will delight your soul.
c74870	Discretion will watch over you,
c74871	and understanding will guard you,
c74872	to deliver you from the way of evil,
c74873	from the man
c74874	who speaks perversity,
c74875	from those who leave the straight paths
c74876	to walk in the ways of darkness,
c74877	from those who enjoy
c74878	doing evil
c74879	and rejoice in the twistedness of evil,
c74880	whose paths are crooked,
c74881	and whose ways are devious.
c74882	It will rescue you from the forbidden woman,
c74883	from the stranger
c74884	with seductive words,
c74885	who abandons the partner of her youth
c74886	and forgets the covenant of her God.
c74887	For her house sinks down to death,
c74888	and her tracks to the departed spirits.
c74889	None who go to her return
c74890	[or] negotiate the paths of life.
c74891	So you will follow in the ways of good men,
c74892	and keep to the paths of the righteous.
c74893	For the upright will inhabit the land,
c74894	and the blameless will remain in it;
c74895	but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
c74896	and the unfaithful {will} be uprooted.
c74897	My son,
c74898	do not forget my teaching,
c74899	but let your heart keep my commandments;
c74900	for they will add length to your days, years and peace to your life.
c74901	Never let loving devotion or faithfulness leave you;
c74902	bind them around your neck,
c74903	write them on the tablet of your heart.
c74904	Then you will find favor and high regard in the sight of God and man.
c74905	Trust in the LORD with all your heart,
c74906	and lean not on your own understanding;
c74907	in all your ways acknowledge Him,
c74908	and He will make your paths {straight}.
c74909	Do not be wise in your own eyes;
c74910	fear the LORD
c74911	and turn away from evil.
c74912	This will bring healing to your body
c74913	and refreshment to your bones.
c74914	Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your harvest;
c74915	then your barns will be filled with plenty,
c74916	and your vats will overflow with new wine.
c74917	the LORD’s discipline
c74918	My son,
c74919	do not despise
c74920	and do not loathe His reproof;
c74921	for
c74922	those He loves,
c74923	the LORD disciplines
c74924	as a father the son
c74925	[in whom] he delights.
c74926	Blessed [is] the man
c74927	who finds wisdom,
c74928	the man
c74929	who acquires understanding,
c74930	for she is more profitable than silver,
c74931	and her gain [is better] than fine gold.
c74932	She is more precious than rubies;
c74933	nothing you desire compares with her.
c74934	Long life is in her right hand;
c74935	in her left hand [are] riches and honor.
c74936	Her ways are pleasant,
c74937	and all her paths [are] peaceful.
c74938	She is a tree of life
c74939	to those who embrace her,
c74941	and those who lay hold of her
c74942	are blessed.
c74943	The LORD founded the earth by wisdom
c74944	and established the heavens by understanding.
c74945	By His knowledge the watery depths were broken open,
c74946	and the clouds dripped with dew.
c74947	My son,
c74948	do not lose sight of this:
c74949	Preserve sound judgment and discernment.
c74950	They will be life to your soul
c74951	and adornment to your neck.
c74952	Then you will go on your way in safety,
c74953	and your foot will not stumble.
c74954	When you lie down,
c74955	you will not be afraid;
c74956	when you rest,
c74957	your sleep will be sweet.
c74958	Do not fear sudden danger
c74959	or the ruin ... the wicked,
c74960	that overtakes
c74961	for the LORD will be your confidence
c74962	and will keep your foot from the snare.
c74963	Do not withhold good from those who deserve it,
c74964	when it is within your power
c74965	to act.
c74966	Do not tell your neighbor,
c74967	“Come
c74968	back
c74969	tomorrow— I will provide
c74970	when you have the means.”
c74971	Do not devise evil against your neighbor,
c74972	for he trustfully dwells beside you.
c74973	Do not accuse a man without cause,
c74974	when he has done you no harm.
c74975	Do not envy a violent man
c74976	or choose any of his ways;
c74977	for the LORD detests the perverse,
c74978	but He is a friend to the upright.
c74979	The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked,
c74980	but He blesses the home of the righteous.
c74981	He mocks those who mock,
c74982	but gives grace to the humble.
c74983	The wise will inherit honor,
c74984	but fools are held up to shame.
c74985	Listen,
c74986	my sons,
c74987	to the instruction of a father;
c74988	pay attention
c74989	and gain understanding.
c74990	For I give you sound teaching;
c74991	do not abandon my instruction.
c74992	When I was a son to my father,
c74993	tender and the only child of my mother,
c74994	he taught
c74995	me and said,
c74996	“Let your heart lay hold of my words;
c74997	keep my commandments
c74998	and you will live.
c74999	Get wisdom,
c75000	get understanding;
c75001	do not forget
c75002	my words or turn from them.
c75003	Do not forsake [wisdom],
c75004	and she will preserve you;
c75005	love her,
c75006	and she will guard you.
c75007	Wisdom is supreme;
c75008	therefore acquire wisdom.
c75009	And whatever else you obtain, gain understanding.
c75010	Prize her,
c75011	and she will exalt you;
c75012	she will honor you.
c75013	if you embrace her,
c75014	She will set a garland of grace on your head;
c75015	she will present you with a crown of beauty.”
c75016	Listen,
c75017	my son,
c75018	and receive my words,
c75019	and the years of your life will be many.
c75020	I will guide you in the way of wisdom;
c75021	I will lead you on straight paths.
c75022	When you walk,
c75023	your steps will not be impeded;
c75025	when you run,
c75026	you will not stumble.
c75027	Hold on to instruction;
c75028	do not let go.
c75029	Guard it,
c75030	for it is your life.
c75031	Do not set foot on the path of the wicked
c75032	[or] walk in the way of evil men.
c75033	Avoid it;
c75034	do not travel on it.
c75035	Turn from it
c75036	and pass on by.
c75037	For they cannot sleep
c75038	unless they do evil,
c75039	they are deprived of slumber
c75040	until they make someone fall,
c75041	since they eat the bread of wickedness
c75042	and drink the wine of violence.
c75043	The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn,
c75044	shining brighter
c75045	and brighter until midday.
c75046	But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom;
c75047	they do not know
c75048	what makes them stumble.
c75049	My son,
c75050	pay attention to my words;
c75051	incline your ear to my sayings.
c75052	Do not lose sight of them;
c75053	keep them within your heart.
c75054	For they are life to those who find them,
c75055	and health to the whole body.
c75056	Guard your heart with all diligence,
c75057	for from it flow springs of life.
c75058	Put away deception from your mouth;
c75059	keep your lips from perverse speech.
c75060	Let your eyes look forward;
c75061	fix your gaze straight ahead.
c75062	Make level paths for your feet,
c75063	and all your ways will be sure.
c75064	Do not swerve to the right or to the left;
c75065	turn your feet {away} from evil.
c75066	My son,
c75067	pay attention to my wisdom;
c75068	incline your ear to my understanding,
c75069	that you may maintain discretion
c75070	and your lips may preserve knowledge.
c75071	Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey
c75072	and her speech [is] smoother than oil,
c75073	her end is bitter as wormwood,
c75074	sharp as a double-edged sword.
c75075	Her feet go down to death;
c75076	her steps lead straight to Sheol.
c75077	the path of life;
c75078	She does not consider
c75079	her ways are unstable.
c75080	she does not know that
c75081	So now,
c75082	my sons,
c75083	listen to me,
c75084	and do not turn aside from the words of my mouth.
c75085	Keep your path far from her;
c75086	do not go near the door of her house,
c75087	lest you concede your vigor to others,
c75088	and your years to one who is cruel,
c75089	lest strangers feast on your wealth,
c75090	and your labors [enrich] the house of a foreigner.
c75091	At the end of your life you will groan
c75092	when your flesh and your body are spent,
c75093	and you will say,
c75094	“How I hated discipline,
c75095	and my heart despised reproof!
c75096	I did not listen to the voice of my teachers
c75097	[or] incline my ear to my mentors.
c75098	I am on the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly.”
c75099	Drink water from your own cistern,
c75100	and running water out of your own well.
c75101	Why should your springs flow in the streets,
c75102	your streams of water in the public squares?
c75103	Let them be yours alone,
c75104	never to be shared with strangers.
c75105	May your fountain be blessed,
c75106	and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth:
c75107	A loving doe, a graceful fawn—
c75108	may her breasts satisfy you always;
c75109	may you be captivated by her love forever.
c75110	Why be captivated,
c75111	my son,
c75112	by an adulteress,
c75113	or embrace the bosom of a stranger?
c75114	For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the LORD,
c75115	and [the Lord] watches all his paths.
c75116	The iniquities of a wicked man entrap him;
c75117	the cords of his own sin entangle him.
c75118	He will die for lack of discipline,
c75119	led astray by his own great folly.
c75120	My son,
c75121	if you have put up security for your neighbor,
c75122	if you have struck hands in pledge with a stranger,
c75123	if you have been trapped by the words of your lips,
c75124	ensnared by the words of your mouth,
c75125	then do this,
c75126	my son,
c75127	to free yourself,
c75128	for you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands:
c75129	Go,
c75130	humble yourself,
c75131	and press your plea with your neighbor.
c75132	Allow no sleep to your eyes
c75133	or slumber to your eyelids.
c75134	Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand [of the hunter],
c75135	like a bird from the fowler’s snare.
c75136	Walk in the manner of the ant,
c75137	O sluggard;
c75138	observe its ways
c75139	and be wise:
c75140	Without a commander, without an overseer or ruler,
c75141	it prepares its provisions in summer;
c75142	it gathers its food at harvest.
c75143	How long
c75144	O sluggard?
c75145	will you lie there,
c75146	When will you get up from your sleep?
c75147	A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands
c75148	to rest,
c75149	and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
c75150	and need like a bandit.
c75151	A worthless person, a wicked man,
c75152	walks with a perverse mouth,
c75153	winking his eyes,
c75154	speaking with his feet,
c75155	and pointing with his fingers.
c75156	With deceit in his heart
c75157	he devises evil; he continually
c75158	sows discord.
c75159	Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly;
c75160	in an instant he will be shattered
c75161	beyond recovery.
c75162	There are six [things that]
c75163	the LORD hates,
c75164	seven that are detestable to Him:
c75165	haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands
c75166	that shed innocent blood,
c75167	a heart
c75168	that devises wicked schemes,
c75169	feet
c75170	swiftly
c75171	that run ... to evil,
c75172	a false witness who gives false testimony,
c75173	and one who stirs up discord among brothers.
c75174	keep
c75175	My son,
c75176	your father’s commandment,
c75177	and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
c75178	Bind them always upon your heart;
c75179	tie them around your neck.
c75180	When you walk,
c75181	they will guide you; when you
c75182	lie down,
c75183	they will watch over you;
c75184	when you awake,
c75185	they will speak to you.
c75186	For this commandment is a lamp,
c75187	this teaching [is] a light,
c75188	and the reproofs of discipline are the way to life,
c75189	to keep you from the evil woman,
c75190	from the smooth tongue of the stranger.
c75191	Do not lust in your heart for her beauty
c75192	or let her captivate you with her eyes.
c75193	For the levy of the prostitute is poverty,
c75194	and the adulteress preys upon your very life.
c75195	Can a man embrace fire
c75196	and his clothes not be burned?
c75197	Can a man walk on hot coals
c75198	without scorching his feet?
c75199	So
c75200	is he who sleeps with another man’s wife;
c75201	no one ... will go unpunished.
c75202	who touches her
c75203	[Men] do not despise the thief
c75204	if he steals
c75205	to satisfy his
c75206	hunger.
c75207	Yet if caught,
c75208	he must pay sevenfold;
c75209	he must give up all the wealth of his house.
c75210	[But] he who commits adultery
c75211	lacks judgment;
c75212	destroys himself.
c75213	whoever does so
c75214	Wounds and dishonor will befall him,
c75215	and his reproach will never be wiped away.
c75216	For jealousy enrages a husband,
c75217	and he will show no mercy in the day of vengeance.
c75218	He will not be appeased by any ransom,
c75219	[or] persuaded
c75220	by lavish gifts.
c75221	My son,
c75222	keep my words
c75223	and treasure my commandments within you.
c75224	Keep my commandments
c75225	and live;
c75226	guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.
c75227	Tie them to your fingers;
c75228	write them on the tablet of your heart.
c75229	Say to wisdom,
c75230	“You are my sister,”
c75231	and call understanding your kinsman,
c75232	that they may keep you from the adulteress,
c75233	from the stranger
c75234	with seductive words.
c75235	For at the window of my house I looked through the lattice.
c75236	I saw among the simple,
c75237	I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking judgment,
c75238	crossing the street near her corner,
c75239	strolling down the road to her house,
c75240	at twilight, as the day was fading, into the dark of the night.
c75241	Then a woman
c75242	came out to meet him,
c75243	[with] attire of a prostitute
c75244	and cunning of heart.
c75245	She is loud
c75246	and defiant;
c75247	her feet do not remain at home.
c75248	Now in the street,
c75249	now in the squares,
c75250	she lurks at every corner.
c75251	She seizes him
c75252	and kisses him;
c75253	she brazenly
c75254	says to him:
c75255	“I have made my peace offerings;
c75256	today I have paid my vows.
c75257	So I came out
c75258	to meet you;
c75259	I sought you,
c75260	and I have found you.
c75261	I have decked my bed with coverings,
c75262	with colored linen from Egypt.
c75263	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, with aloes, and with cinnamon.
c75264	Come,
c75265	let us take our fill of love until the morning.
c75266	Let us delight in loving caresses!
c75267	For my husband is not at home;
c75268	he has gone on a long journey.
c75269	He took with him a bag of money
c75270	and will not be returning until the moon [is] full.”
c75271	With her great persuasion she entices him;
c75272	she lures him with her flattering lips.
c75273	He follows her on impulse,
c75274	like an ox going to the slaughter,
c75275	like a deer bounding into a trap,
c75276	until an arrow pierces his liver,
c75277	like a bird darting into a snare—
c75278	not knowing
c75279	it will cost him his life.
c75280	Now,
c75281	my sons,
c75282	listen to me,
c75283	and attend to the words of my mouth.
c75284	Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways;
c75285	do not stray into her paths.
c75286	For she has brought many down to death;
c75287	her slain are many in number.
c75288	Her house is the road to Sheol,
c75289	descending to the chambers of death.
c75290	Does not wisdom call out,
c75291	and understanding raise her voice?
c75292	On the heights overlooking the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand.
c75293	Beside the gates to the city, at the entrances she cries out:
c75294	“To you,
c75295	O men,
c75296	I call out,
c75297	and my cry is to the sons of men.
c75298	learn
c75299	O you simple,
c75300	to be shrewd,
c75302	and you foolish,
c75303	gain understanding.
c75304	Listen,
c75305	for I speak of noble things,
c75306	and the opening of my lips [will reveal] right.
c75307	For my mouth will speak the truth,
c75308	and wickedness is detestable to my lips.
c75309	All the words of my mouth are righteous;
c75310	none are crooked or perverse.
c75311	They [are] all plain to the discerning,
c75312	and upright to those who find knowledge.
c75313	Receive my instruction
c75314	instead of silver,
c75315	and knowledge rather than pure gold.
c75316	For wisdom is more precious than rubies,
c75317	and nothing you desire compares with her.
c75318	I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence,
c75319	and I find knowledge and discretion.
c75320	To fear the LORD is to hate evil;
c75321	I hate arrogant pride, evil conduct, and perverse speech.
c75322	Counsel and sound judgment are mine;
c75323	I have insight
c75324	and strength.
c75325	By me kings reign,
c75326	and rulers enact just laws;
c75327	By me princes rule,
c75328	and all nobles who govern justly.
c75329	I love those who love me,
c75330	and those who seek me early shall find me.
c75331	With me are riches and honor,
c75332	enduring wealth and righteousness.
c75333	My fruit is better than gold, pure gold,
c75334	and my harvest [surpasses] choice silver.
c75335	I walk in the way of righteousness,
c75336	along the paths of justice,
c75337	bestowing wealth on those who love me,
c75338	and making their treasuries {full}.
c75339	The LORD possessed me at the beginning of His work,
c75340	before His deeds of old.
c75341	From everlasting I was established,
c75342	from the beginning, before the earth began.
c75343	When there were no watery depths, I was brought forth,
c75344	when no springs were overflowing with water.
c75345	Before the mountains were settled,
c75346	before the hills, I was brought forth,
c75347	before He made the land or fields,
c75348	or any of the dust of the earth.
c75349	when He established the heavens,
c75350	I was there
c75351	when He inscribed the horizon on the face of the deep,
c75352	when He established the clouds above,
c75353	when the fountains of the deep gushed forth,
c75354	when He set a boundary for the sea,
c75355	so that the waters would not surpass His command,
c75356	when He marked out the foundations of the earth.
c75357	Then I was a skilled craftsman at His side,
c75358	and His delight day [by] day,
c75359	rejoicing always in His presence.
c75360	I was rejoicing in His whole world,
c75361	delighting together in the sons of men.
c75362	Now therefore,
c75363	my sons,
c75364	listen to me,
c75365	for blessed
c75366	are those who keep my ways.
c75367	Listen to instruction
c75368	and be wise;
c75369	do not ignore it.
c75370	Blessed is the man
c75371	who listens to me,
c75372	watching daily at my doors,
c75373	waiting at the posts of my doorway.
c75374	For
c75375	whoever finds
c75376	me finds life
c75377	and obtains the favor of the LORD;
c75379	but he who fails to find me
c75380	harms himself;
c75381	all who hate me love death.”
c75382	Wisdom has built her house;
c75383	she has carved out her seven pillars.
c75384	She has prepared her meat;
c75385	she has mixed her wine;
c75386	she has also set her table.
c75387	She has sent out her maidservants;
c75388	she calls out from the heights of the city:
c75389	“Whoever [is] simple,
c75390	let him turn in here!”
c75391	To him who lacks judgment
c75392	she says:
c75393	“Come,
c75394	eat my bread,
c75395	and drink the wine
c75396	I have mixed.
c75397	Leave your folly behind,
c75398	and you will live;
c75399	walk in the way of understanding.”
c75400	He who corrects a mocker
c75401	will bring shame on himself;
c75403	he who rebukes a wicked man
c75404	will be tainted.
c75405	Do not rebuke a mocker
c75406	or he will hate you;
c75407	rebuke a wise man,
c75408	and he will love you.
c75409	Instruct a wise man,
c75410	and he will be wiser still;
c75411	teach a righteous man,
c75412	and he will increase [his] learning.
c75413	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,
c75414	and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
c75415	For through [wisdom] your days will be multiplied,
c75416	and years will be added to your life.
c75417	If you are wise,
c75418	you are wise to your own advantage;
c75419	but if you scoff,
c75420	you alone will bear [the consequences].
c75421	The woman named Folly is loud;
c75422	[she is] naive
c75423	and knows nothing.
c75424	She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the heights of the city,
c75425	calling to those who pass by,
c75426	who make their paths {straight}:
c75427	“Whoever [is] simple,
c75428	let him turn in here!”
c75429	To him who lacks judgment
c75430	she says:
c75431	“Stolen water is sweet,
c75432	and bread [eaten] in secret is tasty!”
c75433	But they do not know
c75434	that the dead are there,
c75435	that her guests [are] in the depths of Sheol.
c75436	The proverbs of Solomon:
c75437	A wise son brings joy to his father,
c75438	but a foolish son grief to his mother.
c75439	Ill-gotten treasures profit nothing,
c75440	but righteousness brings deliverance from death.
c75441	The LORD does not let the righteous go hungry,
c75442	but He denies the craving of the wicked.
c75443	Idle hands make one poor,
c75444	but diligent hands bring wealth.
c75445	He who gathers in summer
c75446	[is] a wise son,
c75447	[but] he who sleeps during harvest
c75448	is a disgraceful son.
c75449	Blessings are on the head of the righteous,
c75450	but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
c75451	The memory of the righteous is a blessing,
c75452	but the name of the wicked will rot.
c75453	A wise heart will receive commandments,
c75454	but foolish lips will come to ruin.
c75455	He who walks in integrity
c75456	walks securely,
c75458	but he who perverts his ways
c75459	will be found out.
c75460	He who winks the eye
c75461	causes grief,
c75462	and foolish lips will come to ruin.
c75463	The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,
c75464	but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
c75465	Hatred stirs up dissension,
c75466	but love covers all transgressions.
c75467	Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning,
c75468	but a rod is for the back of him who lacks judgment.
c75469	The wise store up knowledge,
c75470	but the mouth of the fool invites destruction.
c75471	The wealth of the rich man is his fortified city,
c75472	but poverty is the ruin of the poor.
c75473	The labor of the righteous leads to life,
c75474	[but] the gain of the wicked [brings] punishment.
c75475	Whoever heeds instruction is on the path to life,
c75476	but he who ignores reproof goes astray.
c75477	The one who conceals hatred
c75478	has lying lips,
c75479	and whoever spreads slander
c75480	is a fool.
c75481	When words are many, sin is unavoidable,
c75482	but he who restrains his lips is wise.
c75483	The tongue of the righteous [is] choice silver,
c75484	[but] the heart of the wicked [has] little worth.
c75485	The lips of the righteous feed many,
c75486	but fools die for lack of judgment.
c75487	The blessing of the LORD
c75488	enriches,
c75489	and He adds no sorrow to it.
c75490	The fool delights
c75491	in shameful conduct,
c75492	has wisdom.
c75493	but a man of understanding
c75494	What the wicked dreads
c75495	will overtake him,
c75496	but the desire of the righteous will be granted.
c75497	When the whirlwind passes,
c75498	are no more,
c75499	the wicked
c75500	but the righteous are secure forever.
c75501	Like vinegar to the teeth
c75502	and smoke to the eyes,
c75503	so [is] the sluggard to those who send him.
c75504	The fear of the LORD prolongs life,
c75505	but the years of the wicked will be shortened.
c75506	The hope of the righteous is joy,
c75507	but the expectations of the wicked will perish.
c75508	The way of the LORD is a refuge to the upright,
c75509	but destruction [awaits] those who do evil.
c75510	The righteous
c75511	will never be shaken,
c75512	but the wicked
c75513	will not inhabit the land.
c75514	The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom,
c75515	but a perverse tongue will be cut out.
c75516	The lips of the righteous know what is fitting,
c75517	but the mouth of the wicked is perverse.
c75518	Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD,
c75519	but an accurate weight is His delight.
c75520	When pride comes,
c75521	disgrace follows,
c75522	but with humility comes wisdom.
c75523	The integrity of the upright guides them,
c75524	but the perversity of the faithless destroys them.
c75525	Riches are worthless in the day of wrath,
c75526	but righteousness brings deliverance from death.
c75527	The righteousness of the blameless directs their path,
c75528	but the wicked fall by their own wickedness.
c75529	The righteousness of the upright delivers them,
c75530	but the faithless are trapped by their own desires.
c75531	When the wicked man dies, his hope perishes,
c75532	and the hope of his strength vanishes.
c75533	The righteous man is delivered from trouble;
c75534	in his place the wicked man goes in.
c75535	With his mouth the ungodly man destroys his neighbor,
c75536	but through knowledge the righteous are rescued.
c75537	When the righteous thrive, the city rejoices,
c75539	and when the wicked perish,
c75540	there are shouts of joy.
c75541	By the blessing of the upright a city is built up,
c75542	but by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down.
c75543	Whoever shows contempt for his neighbor lacks judgment,
c75544	but a man of understanding holds his peace.
c75545	A gossip
c75546	reveals a secret,
c75547	but a trustworthy person keeps a confidence.
c75548	For lack of guidance, a nation falls,
c75549	but with many counselors [comes] deliverance.
c75550	will surely suffer,
c75551	He who puts up security for a stranger
c75553	but the one who hates indebtedness
c75554	is secure.
c75555	A gracious woman attains honor,
c75556	but violent men gain only wealth.
c75557	A kind man benefits himself,
c75558	but a cruel man brings trouble on himself.
c75559	The wicked man earns an empty wage,
c75561	but he who sows righteousness
c75562	[reaps] a true reward.
c75563	Genuine righteousness leads to life,
c75565	but the pursuit of evil
c75566	brings death.
c75567	The perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD,
c75568	but the blameless in [their] walk are His delight.
c75569	Be assured that the wicked will not go unpunished,
c75570	but the offspring of the righteous will escape.
c75571	Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout [is] a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.
c75572	The desire of the righteous leads only to good,
c75573	but the hope of the wicked [brings] wrath.
c75574	One gives freely,
c75575	yet gains even more;
c75576	another withholds what is right,
c75577	only to become poor.
c75578	A generous soul will prosper,
c75579	and he who refreshes others
c75580	will himself be refreshed.
c75581	the hoarder of grain,
c75582	The people will curse
c75583	but blessing will crown the one who sells it.
c75584	He who searches out good
c75585	finds favor,
c75586	but evil ... to him who seeks it.
c75587	will come
c75588	He who trusts in his riches
c75589	will fall,
c75590	but the righteous will thrive like foliage.
c75591	He who brings trouble on his house
c75592	will inherit the wind,
c75593	and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart.
c75594	The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,
c75595	and he who wins souls [is] wise.
c75596	If the righteous receive their due on earth,
c75597	how much more the ungodly and the sinner!
c75598	Whoever loves discipline
c75599	loves knowledge,
c75601	but he who hates correction
c75602	is stupid.
c75603	The good [man] obtains favor from the LORD,
c75604	but [the LORD] condemns a man who devises evil.
c75605	A man cannot be established through wickedness,
c75606	but the righteous cannot be uprooted.
c75607	A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown,
c75608	but she who causes shame is like decay in his bones.
c75609	The plans of the righteous are just,
c75610	[but] the counsel of the wicked leads to deceit.
c75611	The words of the wicked
c75612	lie in wait for blood,
c75613	but the speech of the upright rescues them.
c75614	The wicked are overthrown
c75615	and perish,
c75616	but the house of the righteous will stand.
c75617	A man is praised according to his wisdom,
c75618	but a twisted mind is despised.
c75619	Better to be lightly esteemed,
c75620	yet have a servant,
c75621	than to be self-important
c75622	but lack food.
c75623	A righteous [man] regards the life of his animal,
c75624	but the tender mercies of the wicked are only cruelty.
c75625	He who works his land
c75626	will have plenty of food,
c75628	but whoever chases fantasies
c75629	lacks judgment.
c75630	The wicked desire the plunder of evil men,
c75631	but the root of the righteous flourishes.
c75632	An evil man is trapped by his rebellious speech,
c75633	but a righteous man escapes from trouble.
c75634	By fruitful speech a man will be filled with good things,
c75635	and the work of a man’s hands will reward him.
c75636	The way of a fool [is] right in his own eyes,
c75638	listens to counsel.
c75639	but a wise [man]
c75640	A fool’s
c75641	anger is known at once,
c75643	overlooks an insult.
c75644	but a prudent [man]
c75645	[He who] speaks the truth
c75646	declares what is right,
c75647	but a false witness [speaks] deceit.
c75649	Speaking rashly is like a piercing sword,
c75650	but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
c75651	Truthful lips endure forever,
c75653	[lasts] only a moment.
c75654	but a lying tongue
c75655	Deceit is in the hearts of those who devise evil,
c75656	but the counselors of peace have joy.
c75657	No harm befalls the righteous,
c75658	but the wicked are filled with trouble.
c75659	Lying lips are detestable to the LORD,
c75660	but those who deal faithfully are His delight.
c75661	A shrewd man keeps his knowledge {to himself},
c75662	but a foolish heart proclaims its folly.
c75663	The hand of the diligent will rule,
c75664	but laziness ends in forced labor.
c75665	Anxiety ... the heart of a man,
c75666	weighs down
c75667	but a good word cheers it up.
c75668	A righteous man is cautious in friendship,
c75669	but the ways of the wicked lead them astray.
c75670	A lazy man does not roast his game,
c75671	but a diligent man prizes his possession.
c75672	There is life in the path of righteousness,
c75673	but another path leads to death.
c75674	A wise son [heeds] his father’s discipline,
c75675	but a mocker does not listen to rebuke.
c75676	From the fruit of his lips a man will enjoy good things,
c75677	but the desire of the faithless is violence.
c75678	He who guards his mouth
c75679	protects his life,
c75680	[but] the one who opens his lips
c75681	invites his own ruin.
c75682	craves,
c75683	yet [gets] nothing,
c75684	The slacker ... but the soul
c75685	of the diligent is fully satisfied.
c75686	The righteous hate falsehood,
c75687	but the wicked bring shame
c75688	and disgrace.
c75689	Righteousness guards the man of integrity,
c75690	but wickedness undermines the sinner.
c75691	One pretends to be rich,
c75692	but has nothing;
c75693	another pretends to be poor,
c75694	yet has great wealth.
c75695	Riches may ransom a man’s life,
c75696	but a poor man hears no threat.
c75697	The light of the righteous shines brightly,
c75698	but the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.
c75699	Arrogance leads only to strife,
c75700	but wisdom is with the well-advised.
c75701	Dishonest wealth will dwindle,
c75703	but what is earned through hard work
c75704	will be multiplied.
c75705	Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
c75706	but desire ... is a tree of life.
c75707	fulfilled
c75708	He who despises instruction
c75709	will pay the penalty,
c75710	but the one who respects a command
c75711	will be rewarded.
c75712	The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life,
c75713	turning one from the snares of death.
c75714	Good understanding wins favor,
c75715	but the way of the faithless is difficult.
c75716	Every prudent [man] acts with knowledge,
c75717	but a fool displays [his] folly.
c75718	A wicked messenger falls into trouble,
c75719	but a faithful envoy brings healing.
c75720	Poverty and shame
c75721	come to him who ignores discipline,
c75723	but whoever heeds correction
c75724	will be honored.
c75725	Desire
c75726	fulfilled
c75727	is sweet to the soul,
c75728	is detestable to fools.
c75729	but turning from evil
c75730	He who walks with the wise
c75731	will become wise,
c75733	but the companion of fools
c75734	will be destroyed.
c75735	Disaster pursues sinners,
c75736	but prosperity is the reward of the righteous.
c75737	A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,
c75738	but the sinner’s wealth [is] passed to the righteous.
c75739	Abundant food [is in] the fallow ground of the poor,
c75740	but without justice it is swept away.
c75741	He who spares the rod
c75742	hates his son,
c75744	but he who loves him
c75745	disciplines him diligently.
c75746	A righteous man eats to his heart’s content,
c75747	but the stomach of the wicked is empty.
c75748	Every wise woman builds her house,
c75749	but a foolish one tears it down with her own hands.
c75750	He who walks in uprightness
c75751	fears the LORD,
c75752	but the one who is devious in his ways despises Him.
c75753	The proud speech of a fool brings a rod to his back,
c75754	but the lips of the wise protect them.
c75755	Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty,
c75756	but an abundant harvest comes through the strength of the ox.
c75757	An honest witness does not deceive,
c75758	but a dishonest witness pours forth lies.
c75759	A mocker seeks wisdom
c75760	and [finds] none,
c75761	but knowledge comes easily to the discerning.
c75762	Stay away from a foolish man;
c75763	you will gain no knowledge from his speech.
c75764	The wisdom of the prudent
c75765	is to discern his way,
c75766	but the folly of fools deceives them.
c75767	Fools mock the making of amends,
c75768	but goodwill is found among the upright.
c75769	The heart knows its own bitterness,
c75770	and no stranger shares in its joy.
c75771	The house of the wicked will be destroyed,
c75772	but the tent of the upright will flourish.
c75773	There is a way that seems right to a man,
c75774	but its end is the way of death.
c75775	Even in laughter the heart may ache,
c75776	and joy may end in sorrow.
c75777	The backslider in heart will have the fill of his own ways,
c75778	but a good man [will be rewarded] for his.
c75779	The simple [man] believes every word,
c75780	but the prudent man watches his steps.
c75781	A wise [man] fears
c75782	and turns from evil,
c75783	but a fool is careless
c75784	and reckless.
c75785	A quick-tempered man acts foolishly,
c75786	and a devious man is hated.
c75787	The simple inherit folly,
c75788	but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
c75789	The evil bow before the good,
c75790	and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
c75791	The poor [man] is hated even by his neighbor,
c75792	but many are those who love the rich.
c75793	He who despises his neighbor
c75794	sins,
c75796	he who shows kindness to the poor.
c75797	but blessed is
c75798	Do not those who contrive evil go astray?
c75799	But those who plan goodness find loving devotion and truth.
c75800	There is profit in all labor,
c75801	but mere talk leads only to poverty.
c75802	The crown of the wise is their wealth,
c75803	[but] the effort of fools [is] folly.
c75804	A truthful witness saves lives,
c75805	but one who utters lies is deceitful.
c75806	He who fears the LORD is secure in confidence,
c75807	and his children shall have a place of refuge.
c75808	The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life,
c75809	turning [a man] from the snares of death.
c75810	A large population is a king’s splendor,
c75811	but a lack of subjects is a prince’s ruin.
c75812	A patient [man] has great understanding,
c75813	but a quick-tempered [man] promotes folly.
c75814	A tranquil heart is life to the body,
c75815	but envy rots the bones.
c75816	He who oppresses the poor
c75817	taunts their Maker,
c75818	but whoever is kind to the needy honors Him.
c75819	The wicked [man] is thrown down by his own sin,
c75820	but the righteous [man] has a refuge when he dies.
c75821	Wisdom rests in the heart of the discerning;
c75822	even in the hearts of fools she is known.
c75823	Righteousness exalts a nation,
c75824	but sin is a disgrace to any people.
c75825	A king delights in a wise servant,
c75826	but his anger falls
c75827	on the shameful.
c75828	A gentle answer turns away wrath,
c75829	but a harsh word stirs up anger.
c75830	The tongue of the wise commends knowledge,
c75831	but the mouth of the fool spouts folly.
c75832	The eyes of the LORD are in every place,
c75833	observing the evil and the good.
c75834	A soothing tongue is a tree of life,
c75835	but a perverse [tongue] crushes the spirit.
c75836	A fool rejects his father’s discipline,
c75838	but whoever heeds correction
c75839	is prudent.
c75840	The house of the righteous has great treasure,
c75841	but the income of the wicked is trouble.
c75842	The lips of the wise spread knowledge,
c75843	but not so the hearts of fools.
c75844	The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable to the LORD,
c75845	but the prayer of the upright is His delight.
c75846	The LORD detests the way of the wicked,
c75848	those who pursue righteousness.
c75849	but He loves
c75850	Discipline is harsh for him who leaves the path;
c75851	he who hates correction
c75852	will die.
c75853	Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the LORD—
c75854	how much more the hearts of men!
c75855	A mocker does not love
c75856	to be reproved,
c75857	nor will he consult the wise.
c75858	A joyful heart makes a cheerful countenance,
c75859	but sorrow of the heart crushes the spirit.
c75860	A discerning heart seeks knowledge,
c75861	but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly.
c75862	All the days of the oppressed are bad,
c75863	but a cheerful heart has a continual feast.
c75864	Better a little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure
c75865	with turmoil.
c75866	Better a dish of vegetables
c75867	where there is love
c75868	than a fattened ox
c75869	with hatred.
c75870	A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,
c75871	but he who is slow to anger calms dispute.
c75872	The way of the sluggard is like a hedge of thorns,
c75873	but the path of the upright is a highway.
c75874	A wise son brings joy to his father,
c75875	but a foolish man despises his mother.
c75876	Folly is joy to one who lacks judgment,
c75877	but a man of understanding ... a straight path.
c75878	walks
c75879	Plans fail for lack of counsel,
c75880	but with many advisers they succeed.
c75881	A man takes joy in a fitting reply,
c75882	a timely word!
c75883	and how good is
c75884	The path of life [leads] upward for the wise,
c75885	that he may avoid going down to Sheol.
c75886	The LORD tears down the house of the proud,
c75887	but He protects the boundaries of the widow.
c75888	The LORD detests the thoughts of the wicked,
c75889	but the words of the pure are pleasant [to Him].
c75890	brings trouble on his household,
c75891	He who is greedy for unjust gain
c75893	but he who hates bribes
c75894	will live.
c75895	The heart of the righteous ponders
c75896	how to answer,
c75897	but the mouth of the wicked blurts out evil.
c75898	The LORD is far from the wicked,
c75899	but He hears the prayer of the righteous.
c75900	The light of the eyes cheers the heart,
c75901	[and] good news nourishes the bones.
c75903	He who listens to life-giving reproof
c75904	will dwell among the wise.
c75905	He who ignores discipline
c75906	despises himself,
c75908	but whoever heeds correction
c75909	gains understanding.
c75910	The fear of the LORD [is] the instruction of wisdom,
c75911	and humility comes before honor.
c75912	The plans of the heart belong to man,
c75913	but the reply of the tongue [is] from the LORD.
c75914	All a man’s ways [are] pure in his own eyes,
c75915	but his motives are weighed by the LORD.
c75916	Commit your works to the LORD,
c75917	and your plans will be achieved.
c75918	The LORD has made everything for His purpose—
c75919	even the wicked for the day of disaster.
c75920	Everyone [who is] proud in heart is detestable to the LORD;
c75921	be assured that
c75922	he will not go unpunished.
c75923	By loving devotion and truth, wickedness is atoned for,
c75924	and by the fear of the LORD [a man] turns aside from evil.
c75925	When a man’s ways please the LORD,
c75926	He makes even [the man’s] enemies live at peace with him.
c75927	Better a little with righteousness than great gain
c75928	with injustice.
c75929	A man’s heart plans his course,
c75930	but the LORD determines his steps.
c75931	A divine verdict is on the lips of a king;
c75932	his mouth should not betray justice.
c75933	Honest scales and balances [are from] the LORD;
c75934	all the weights in the bag are His concern.
c75935	is detestable to kings,
c75936	Wicked behavior
c75937	for a throne is established through righteousness.
c75938	Righteous lips are a king’s delight,
c75940	and he who speaks honestly
c75941	is beloved.
c75942	The wrath of a king is a messenger of death,
c75943	but a wise man will pacify it.
c75944	When a king’s face brightens, there is life;
c75945	his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.
c75946	to acquire wisdom
c75947	How much better ... than gold;
c75949	to gain understanding
c75950	is more desirable than silver.
c75951	The highway of the upright
c75952	leads away from evil;
c75953	protects his life.
c75954	he who guards his way
c75955	Pride goes before destruction,
c75956	and a haughty spirit before a fall.
c75957	It is better
c75958	to be lowly in spirit among the humble
c75959	than to divide the spoil with the proud.
c75960	Whoever heeds instruction
c75961	will find success,
c75963	is he who trusts in the LORD.
c75964	and blessed
c75965	The wise in heart will be called discerning,
c75966	and pleasant speech increases learning.
c75967	Understanding is a fountain of life to its possessor,
c75968	but the discipline of fools is folly.
c75969	The heart of the wise [man] instructs his mouth
c75970	and adds persuasiveness to his lips.
c75971	Pleasant words are a honeycomb,
c75972	sweet to the soul
c75973	and healing to the bones.
c75974	There is a way that seems right to a man,
c75975	but its end is the way of death.
c75976	A worker’s appetite works for him
c75977	because his hunger drives him onward.
c75978	A worthless man digs up evil,
c75979	and his speech is like a scorching fire.
c75980	A perverse man spreads dissension,
c75981	and a gossip divides close friends.
c75982	A violent man entices his neighbor
c75983	and leads him down a path
c75984	[that is] not good.
c75985	He who winks his eye
c75986	devises perversity;
c75987	he who purses his lips
c75988	is bent on evil.
c75989	Gray hair [is] a crown of glory;
c75990	it is attained along the path of righteousness.
c75991	[He who is] slow to anger [is] better than a warrior,
c75993	and he who controls his temper [is greater]
c75994	than one who captures a city.
c75995	The lot is cast into the lap,
c75996	but its every decision is from the LORD.
c75997	Better a dry morsel
c75998	in quietness
c75999	than a house
c76000	full of feasting with strife.
c76001	A wise servant will rule over ... son
c76002	a disgraceful
c76003	and share his inheritance as one of the brothers.
c76004	A crucible for silver
c76005	and a furnace for gold,
c76006	but the LORD is the tester of hearts.
c76007	A wicked man listens to evil lips;
c76008	a liar gives ear to a destructive tongue.
c76009	He who mocks the poor
c76010	insults their Maker;
c76011	whoever gloats over calamity will not go unpunished.
c76012	Grandchildren are the crown of the aged,
c76013	and the glory of a son is his father.
c76014	Eloquent words are unfit for a fool;
c76015	how much worse are lying lips to a ruler!
c76016	A bribe is a charm to its giver;
c76017	wherever
c76018	he turns,
c76019	he succeeds.
c76020	Whoever conceals an offense
c76021	promotes love,
c76023	but he who brings it up
c76024	separates friends.
c76025	A rebuke affects a man of discernment
c76026	more than a hundred lashes to a fool.
c76027	An evil [man] seeks only rebellion;
c76028	so a cruel messenger will be sent against him.
c76029	[It is better] to meet a bear robbed of her cubs
c76030	than a fool in his folly.
c76031	If anyone returns evil for good,
c76032	evil will never leave his house.
c76033	To start a quarrel is to release a flood;
c76035	before it breaks out.
c76036	so abandon the dispute
c76037	Acquitting the guilty
c76038	and condemning the righteous—
c76039	both are detestable to the LORD.
c76040	Why should the fool have money in his hand
c76041	of buying wisdom?
c76042	with no intention
c76043	A friend loves at all times,
c76044	and a brother is born for adversity.
c76045	A man lacking judgment strikes hands in pledge
c76046	and puts up security for his neighbor.
c76047	He who loves transgression
c76048	loves strife;
c76049	he who builds his gate high
c76050	invites destruction.
c76051	The one with a perverse heart finds no good,
c76053	and he whose tongue is deceitful
c76054	will fall into trouble.
c76055	A man fathers a fool
c76056	to his own grief;
c76057	the father of a fool has no joy.
c76058	A joyful heart is good medicine,
c76059	but a broken spirit dries up the bones.
c76060	A wicked [man] takes a covert bribe
c76061	to subvert the course of justice.
c76062	Wisdom is the focus of the discerning,
c76063	but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.
c76064	A foolish son brings grief to his father
c76065	and bitterness to her who bore him.
c76066	It is surely ... to punish the innocent
c76067	not good
c76068	or to beat a noble for his honesty.
c76069	restrains his words,
c76070	A man of knowledge
c76071	and a man of understanding keeps a cool head.
c76072	Even a fool
c76073	if he keeps silent,
c76074	is considered wise
c76075	when he holds his tongue.
c76076	[and] discerning
c76077	He who isolates himself pursues selfish desires;
c76078	he rebels against all sound judgment.
c76079	A fool does not delight in understanding,
c76080	but only
c76081	in airing his opinions.
c76082	With a wicked [man] comes
c76083	contempt as well,
c76084	and shame is accompanied by disgrace.
c76085	The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters;
c76086	the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.
c76087	Showing partiality to the wicked
c76088	is not good,
c76089	nor is depriving the innocent of justice.
c76090	A fool’s lips bring strife,
c76091	and his mouth invites a beating.
c76092	A fool’s mouth is his ruin,
c76093	and his lips [are] a snare to his soul.
c76094	A gossip’s words are like choice morsels,
c76095	and they sink into the inmost being.
c76096	Whoever is slothful in his work
c76097	is brother to him who destroys.
c76098	The name of the LORD is a strong tower;
c76099	the righteous run to it
c76100	and are safe.
c76101	A rich man’s wealth is his fortified city;
c76102	it is like a high wall in his imagination.
c76103	Before his downfall a man’s heart is proud,
c76104	but humility comes before honor.
c76105	He who answers a matter
c76106	before he hears [it]—
c76107	this [is] folly ... to him.
c76108	and disgrace
c76109	The spirit of a man can endure his sickness,
c76110	a broken spirit?
c76111	but who can survive
c76112	The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge,
c76113	and the ear of the wise seeks it out.
c76114	A man’s gift opens doors for him,
c76115	and brings him before great men.
c76116	The first to state his case seems right
c76117	until another comes forward
c76118	and examines him.
c76119	Casting the lot ends quarrels
c76120	and separates strong opponents.
c76121	An offended brother [is harder to win] than a fortified city,
c76122	and disputes are like the bars of a castle.
c76123	From the fruit of his mouth a man’s belly is filled;
c76124	with the harvest from his lips he is satisfied.
c76125	Life and death are in the power of the tongue,
c76126	and those who love [it] will eat its fruit.
c76127	He who finds a wife
c76128	finds a good thing
c76129	and obtains favor from the LORD.
c76130	The poor man pleads for mercy,
c76131	but the rich man answers harshly.
c76132	A man of many companions
c76133	may come to ruin,
c76134	but there is a friend
c76135	who stays closer than a brother.
c76136	Better a poor man
c76137	who walks with integrity
c76138	whose lips are perverse.
c76139	than a fool
c76140	Even zeal is no good without knowledge,
c76142	and he who hurries his footsteps
c76143	misses the mark.
c76144	A man’s own folly subverts his way,
c76145	yet his heart rages against the LORD.
c76146	Wealth attracts many friends,
c76147	but a poor man is deserted by his friend.
c76148	A false witness will not go unpunished,
c76149	and one who utters lies
c76150	will not escape.
c76151	Many seek the favor of the prince,
c76152	and everyone is a friend of the gift giver.
c76153	All the brothers of a poor man hate him—
c76154	how much more do his friends avoid him!
c76155	He may pursue them with pleading,
c76156	but they are nowhere to be found.
c76157	He who acquires wisdom
c76158	loves himself;
c76159	one who safeguards understanding
c76160	will find success.
c76161	A false witness will not go unpunished,
c76162	and one who pours out lies
c76163	will perish.
c76164	Luxury is unseemly for a fool—
c76165	how much worse for a slave
c76166	to rule over princes!
c76167	A man’s insight gives him patience,
c76168	and his virtue
c76169	is to overlook an offense.
c76170	A king’s rage is like the roar of a lion,
c76171	but his favor is like dew on the grass.
c76172	A foolish son is his father’s ruin,
c76173	and a quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping.
c76174	Houses and wealth are inherited from fathers,
c76175	wife [is] from the LORD.
c76176	but a prudent
c76177	Laziness brings on deep sleep,
c76178	and an idle soul will suffer hunger.
c76179	He who keeps a commandment preserves his soul;
c76180	[but] he who is careless in his ways will die.
c76181	Kindness to the poor is a loan to the LORD,
c76182	and He will repay [the lender].
c76183	Discipline your son,
c76184	for in that there is hope;
c76186	to his death.
c76187	do not be party
c76188	A man of great anger must pay the penalty;
c76189	if you rescue [him],
c76190	you will have to do so again.
c76191	Listen to counsel
c76192	and accept discipline,
c76193	that you may be wise the rest of your days.
c76194	Many plans are in a man’s heart,
c76195	but the purpose
c76196	of the LORD will prevail.
c76197	The desire of a man is loving devotion;
c76198	better to be poor than a liar.
c76199	The fear of the LORD leads to life,
c76200	that one may rest content,
c76201	without visitation from harm.
c76202	The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
c76203	he will not even bring it back to his mouth.
c76204	Strike a mocker,
c76205	and the simple will beware;
c76207	rebuke the discerning [man],
c76208	and he will gain knowledge.
c76209	He who assaults his father and evicts his mother
c76210	is a son
c76211	who brings shame
c76212	and disgrace.
c76213	If you cease
c76214	my son,
c76215	to hear instruction,
c76216	you will stray from the words of knowledge.
c76217	A corrupt witness mocks justice,
c76218	and a wicked mouth swallows iniquity.
c76219	Judgments are prepared for mockers,
c76220	and beatings for the backs of fools.
c76221	Wine is a mocker,
c76222	strong drink is a brawler,
c76223	and whoever
c76224	is led astray by them
c76225	is not wise.
c76226	The terror of a king is like the roar of a lion;
c76227	whoever provokes [him] forfeits his own life.
c76228	It is honorable for a man to resolve a dispute,
c76229	but any fool will quarrel.
c76230	The sluggard does not plow in season;
c76231	at harvest time he looks,
c76232	but nothing is there.
c76233	The intentions of a man’s heart are deep waters,
c76234	but a man of understanding draws them out.
c76235	Many a man
c76236	proclaims his loving devotion,
c76238	a trustworthy man?
c76239	but who can find
c76240	The righteous man walks with integrity;
c76241	blessed [are] his children after him.
c76242	A king
c76243	who sits on a throne to judge
c76244	sifts out all evil with his eyes.
c76245	Who can say,
c76246	“I have kept my heart pure;
c76247	I am cleansed from my sin”?
c76248	Differing weights and unequal measures—
c76249	both are detestable to the LORD.
c76250	Even a young man is known by his actions—
c76251	whether ... is pure
c76252	his conduct ... and upright.
c76253	Ears
c76254	that hear
c76255	and eyes
c76256	that see—
c76257	the LORD has made them both.
c76258	Do not love sleep,
c76259	or you will grow poor;
c76260	open your eyes,
c76261	[and] you will have plenty of food.
c76262	“Worthless, worthless!”
c76263	says the buyer,
c76264	but on the way out,
c76265	he gloats.
c76266	There is gold and abundance of rubies,
c76267	but lips of knowledge are a rare treasure.
c76268	Take the garment
c76269	of the one who posts security for a stranger;
c76270	get collateral if it is for a wayward woman.
c76271	Food gained by fraud is sweet to a man,
c76272	but later his mouth is full of gravel.
c76273	Set plans by consultation,
c76274	and wage war under sound guidance.
c76275	He who reveals secrets is a constant gossip;
c76277	the one who babbles with his lips.
c76278	avoid
c76279	Whoever curses his father or mother,
c76280	his lamp will be extinguished in deepest darkness.
c76281	An inheritance gained quickly
c76282	will not be blessed in the end.
c76283	Do not say,
c76284	“I will avenge this evil!”
c76285	Wait on the LORD,
c76286	and He will deliver you.
c76287	Unequal weights are detestable to the LORD,
c76288	and dishonest scales are no good.
c76289	A man’s steps [are] from the LORD,
c76290	can anyone
c76291	so how ... understand his own way?
c76292	It is a trap for a man
c76293	to dedicate something rashly
c76294	only later to reconsider his vows.
c76295	A wise king separates out the wicked
c76296	and drives the threshing wheel over them.
c76297	The spirit of a man [is] the lamp of the LORD,
c76298	searching out his inmost being.
c76299	Loving devotion and truth preserve a king;
c76300	by these he maintains his throne.
c76301	The glory of young men is their strength,
c76302	and gray hair is the splendor of the old.
c76303	Lashes and wounds scour evil,
c76304	and beatings cleanse the inmost parts.
c76305	The king’s heart is a waterway in the hand of the LORD;
c76306	where
c76307	He pleases.
c76308	He directs it
c76309	All a man’s ways seem right to him,
c76310	but the LORD weighs the heart.
c76311	To do righteousness and justice
c76312	is more desirable to the LORD than sacrifice.
c76313	Haughty eyes and a proud heart— the guides of the wicked—
c76314	[are] sin.
c76315	The plans of the diligent bring plenty,
c76316	as surely as haste [leads] to poverty.
c76317	Making a fortune by a lying tongue is a vanishing mist, a deadly pursuit.
c76318	The violence of the wicked will sweep them away
c76319	because they refuse
c76320	to do what is just.
c76321	The way of a guilty man is crooked,
c76322	of the innocent
c76323	but the conduct ... is upright.
c76324	Better
c76325	to live on a corner of the roof
c76326	than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
c76327	The soul of the wicked craves evil;
c76328	his neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.
c76329	When a mocker is punished,
c76330	the simple gain wisdom;
c76332	and when a wise man is instructed,
c76333	he acquires knowledge.
c76334	The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked;
c76335	He brings the wicked to ruin.
c76336	Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor,
c76337	he too shall cry out
c76338	and receive no answer.
c76339	A gift in secret soothes anger,
c76340	and a covert bribe [pacifies] great wrath.
c76341	is a joy to the righteous,
c76342	Justice executed
c76343	but a terror to the workers of iniquity.
c76344	The man
c76345	who strays from the path of understanding
c76346	will rest in the assembly of the dead.
c76347	He who loves pleasure will become poor;
c76348	the one who loves wine and oil will never become rich.
c76349	The wicked [shall become] a ransom for the righteous,
c76350	and the faithless for the upright.
c76351	Better
c76352	to live in the desert
c76353	than with a contentious and ill-tempered wife.
c76354	Precious treasures and oil are in the dwelling of the wise,
c76355	but a foolish man consumes them.
c76356	He who pursues righteousness and loving devotion finds life, righteousness, and honor.
c76357	A wise [man] scales the city of the mighty
c76358	and pulls down the stronghold in which they trust.
c76359	He who guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul from distress.
c76360	Proud, Arrogant,
c76361	and Mocker are the names
c76362	of him who acts with excessive pride.
c76363	The craving of the sluggard will kill him
c76364	because his hands refuse
c76365	to work.
c76366	All day long he covets more,
c76367	but the righteous give
c76368	without restraint.
c76369	The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable—
c76370	how much more so when brought with ill intent!
c76371	A lying witness will perish,
c76372	but the man who listens [to truth] will speak forever.
c76373	A wicked man hardens his face,
c76374	but the upright [man]
c76375	makes his way {sure}.
c76376	No wisdom,
c76377	no understanding,
c76378	and no counsel can prevail against the LORD.
c76379	A horse is prepared for the day of battle,
c76380	but victory [is] of the LORD.
c76381	A good name is more desirable than great riches;
c76382	favor is better than silver and gold.
c76383	The rich and the poor have this in common:
c76384	the LORD [is] the maker of all.
c76385	The prudent see danger
c76386	and take cover,
c76387	but the simple keep going
c76388	and suffer the consequences.
c76389	The rewards of humility [and] the fear of the LORD [are] wealth and honor and life.
c76390	Thorns and snares [lie] on the path of the perverse;
c76391	he who guards his soul stays far from them.
c76392	Train up a child in the way he should go,
c76393	and when he is old
c76394	he will not depart from it.
c76395	The rich rule over the poor,
c76396	and the borrower is slave to the lender.
c76397	He who sows injustice will reap disaster,
c76398	and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.
c76399	A generous [man]
c76400	will be blessed,
c76401	for he shares his food with the poor.
c76402	Drive out the mocker,
c76403	and conflict will depart;
c76404	even quarreling and insults will cease.
c76405	He who loves a pure heart
c76406	and gracious lips
c76407	[will have] the king for a friend.
c76408	The LORD’s eyes keep watch over knowledge,
c76409	but He frustrates the words of the faithless.
c76410	The sluggard says,
c76411	“[There is] a lion outside!
c76412	I will be slain in the streets!”
c76413	The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit;
c76414	he who is cursed by the LORD will fall into it.
c76415	Foolishness [is] bound up in the heart of a child,
c76416	[but] the rod of discipline will drive it far from him.
c76417	Oppressing the poor
c76418	to enrich oneself,
c76419	or giving gifts to the rich,
c76420	[will] surely lead to poverty.
c76421	Incline your ear
c76422	and hear the words of the wise—
c76423	apply your mind to my knowledge—
c76424	for it is pleasing
c76425	when you keep them within you
c76426	and they are constantly on your lips.
c76427	So that your trust may be in the LORD,
c76428	I have instructed you today, even you.
c76429	Have I not written for you thirty sayings about counsel and knowledge,
c76430	to show you true and reliable words,
c76431	so that you can give sound answers to those who sent you?
c76432	Do not rob a poor
c76433	man because he is poor,
c76434	and do not crush the afflicted at the gate,
c76435	for the LORD will take up their case
c76436	and will plunder those who rob them.
c76437	Do not make friends with an angry man,
c76438	and do not associate with a hot-tempered man,
c76439	or you may learn his ways
c76440	and entangle yourself in a snare.
c76441	Do not be one who gives pledges,
c76442	who puts up security for debts.
c76443	If you have nothing with which
c76444	to pay,
c76445	why should your bed be taken from under you?
c76446	Do not move an ancient boundary stone
c76447	which your fathers have set.
c76448	Do you see a man skilled in his work?
c76449	He will be stationed in the presence of kings;
c76450	he will not stand before obscure men.
c76451	When you sit down
c76452	to dine with a ruler,
c76453	consider carefully
c76454	what is set before you,
c76455	and put a knife to your throat
c76456	if you possess a [great] appetite.
c76457	Do not crave his delicacies,
c76458	for that food is deceptive.
c76459	Do not wear yourself out
c76460	to get rich;
c76461	be wise enough to restrain yourself.
c76462	When you glance [at wealth],
c76463	it disappears,
c76464	for it makes wings for itself
c76465	and flies like an eagle to the sky.
c76466	Do not eat the bread of a stingy man
c76467	[or] crave his delicacies,
c76468	for
c76469	he is keeping track, inwardly
c76470	[counting the cost].
c76471	“Eat
c76472	and drink,”
c76473	he says to you,
c76474	but his heart is not with you.
c76475	what little you have eaten
c76476	You will vomit up
c76477	and waste your pleasant words.
c76478	Do not speak to a fool,
c76479	for he will despise the wisdom of your words.
c76480	Do not move an ancient boundary stone
c76481	[or] encroach on the fields of the fatherless,
c76482	for their Redeemer is strong;
c76483	He will take up their case against you.
c76484	Apply your heart to instruction
c76485	and your ears to words of knowledge.
c76486	Do not withhold discipline from a child;
c76487	although you strike him with a rod,
c76488	he will not die.
c76489	Strike him with a rod,
c76490	and you will deliver his soul from Sheol.
c76491	My son,
c76492	if your heart is wise,
c76493	my own heart ... rejoice.
c76494	will indeed
c76495	My inmost being will rejoice
c76496	when your lips speak what is right.
c76497	Do not let your heart envy sinners,
c76498	but always continue in the fear of the LORD.
c76499	For surely there is a future,
c76500	and your hope will not be cut off.
c76501	Listen,
c76502	my son,
c76503	and be wise,
c76504	and guide your heart on the right course.
c76505	Do not join those who drink too much wine
c76506	or gorge themselves on meat.
c76507	For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty,
c76508	and drowsiness will clothe them in rags.
c76509	Listen to your father
c76510	who gave you life,
c76511	and do not despise
c76512	your mother when she is old.
c76513	Invest in truth
c76514	and never sell it— in wisdom and instruction and understanding.
c76515	The father of a righteous man will greatly rejoice,
c76516	and he who fathers a wise son will delight in him.
c76517	May your father and mother be glad,
c76518	and may she who gave you birth rejoice!
c76519	give
c76520	My son,
c76521	me your heart,
c76522	and let your eyes delight in my ways.
c76523	For a prostitute is a deep pit,
c76524	and an adulteress is a narrow well.
c76525	Like a robber she lies in wait
c76526	and multiplies the faithless among men.
c76527	Who has woe?
c76528	Who has sorrow?
c76529	Who has contentions?
c76530	Who has complaints?
c76531	Who {has} needless wounds?
c76532	Who has bloodshot eyes?
c76533	Those who linger over wine,
c76534	those who go
c76535	to taste mixed drinks.
c76536	Do not gaze at wine
c76537	while it is red,
c76538	when it sparkles in the cup
c76539	and goes down smoothly.
c76540	In the end it bites like a snake
c76541	and stings like a viper.
c76542	Your eyes will see strange things,
c76543	and your mind will utter perversities.
c76544	You will be like one sleeping on the high seas
c76545	or lying on the top of a mast:
c76546	“They struck me,
c76547	but I feel no pain!
c76548	They beat me,
c76549	but I did not know it!
c76550	When can I wake up
c76551	another
c76552	to search for ... drink?”
c76553	Do not envy wicked men
c76554	or desire
c76555	their company;
c76556	for their hearts devise violence,
c76557	and their lips declare trouble.
c76558	By wisdom a house is built
c76559	and by understanding it is established;
c76560	through knowledge its rooms are filled with every precious and beautiful treasure.
c76561	A wise man [is] strong,
c76562	and a man of knowledge enhances his strength;
c76563	only with sound guidance should you wage war,
c76564	and victory lies in a multitude of counselors.
c76565	Wisdom [is] too high for a fool;
c76566	he does not open his mouth in the meeting place.
c76567	He who plots
c76568	evil
c76569	will be called a schemer.
c76570	A foolish scheme is sin,
c76571	and a mocker is detestable to men.
c76572	If you falter in the day of distress,
c76573	how small [is] your strength!
c76574	Rescue
c76575	those being led away to death,
c76576	those stumbling toward the slaughter.
c76577	and restrain
c76578	If you say,
c76579	“Behold, we did not know about this,”
c76580	will not ... who weighs hearts
c76581	He ... consider it?
c76582	who guards your life
c76583	Does not the One ... know?
c76584	Will He not repay a man according to his deeds?
c76585	Eat
c76586	my son,
c76587	honey,
c76588	for it is good,
c76589	and the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.
c76590	Know that wisdom [is sweet] for your soul.
c76591	If you find it,
c76592	there is a future [for you],
c76593	and your hope will never be cut off.
c76594	Do not lie in wait,
c76595	O wicked [man],
c76596	near the dwelling of the righteous;
c76597	do not destroy his resting place.
c76598	For though a righteous man falls seven times,
c76599	he will get up,
c76600	but the wicked will stumble into ruin.
c76601	when your enemy falls,
c76602	Do not gloat
c76604	when he stumbles,
c76605	and do not let your heart rejoice
c76606	or the LORD will see
c76607	and disapprove,
c76608	and turn His wrath away from him.
c76609	Do not fret over evildoers,
c76610	and do not be envious of the wicked.
c76611	For the evil [man] has no future;
c76612	the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.
c76613	fear the LORD
c76614	My son,
c76615	and the king,
c76616	and do not associate with the rebellious.
c76617	For [those two] will bring sudden destruction;
c76619	what ruin [they] can bring?
c76620	who knows
c76621	These also are sayings of the wise:
c76622	To show partiality in judgment
c76623	is not good.
c76624	Whoever tells the guilty,
c76625	“You are innocent”—
c76626	peoples will curse him,
c76627	and nations will denounce him;
c76628	but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,
c76629	and rich blessing will come upon them.
c76630	An honest answer given is like a kiss on the lips.
c76631	Complete your outdoor work,
c76632	and prepare your field;
c76633	after that,
c76634	you can build your house.
c76635	Do not testify against your neighbor without cause,
c76636	and do not deceive with your lips.
c76637	Do not say,
c76638	“I will do to him as
c76639	he has done to me;
c76640	I will repay the man according to his work.”
c76641	I went past the field of a sluggard
c76642	and by the vineyard of a man lacking judgment.
c76644	Thorns had grown up everywhere,
c76645	thistles had covered the ground,
c76646	and the stone wall was broken down.
c76647	I observed
c76648	and took [it] to heart;
c76649	I looked
c76650	and received instruction:
c76651	A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands
c76652	to rest,
c76653	and poverty will come [upon you] like a robber,
c76654	and need like a bandit.
c76655	These [are] additional proverbs of Solomon,
c76656	which were copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:
c76657	It is the glory of God
c76658	to conceal a matter
c76659	and the glory of kings
c76660	to search it out.
c76661	As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings cannot be searched.
c76662	Remove the dross from the silver,
c76663	and a vessel for a silversmith will come forth.
c76664	Remove the wicked from the king’s presence,
c76665	and his throne will be established in righteousness.
c76666	Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king,
c76667	and do not stand in the place of great [men];
c76668	for it is better
c76669	that he says to you,
c76670	“Come up here!”
c76671	than demote you in the presence of the prince.
c76672	Even what you have seen with your own eyes,
c76673	do not go out
c76674	to argue in haste.
c76675	Otherwise,
c76676	what will you do in the end
c76677	when your opponent puts you to shame?
c76678	Argue your case with your neighbor
c76679	without betraying another’s confidence,
c76680	lest the one who hears may disgrace you,
c76681	and your infamy never go away.
c76682	A word ... [is like] apples of gold in settings of silver.
c76683	fitly spoken
c76684	[Like] an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise man’s rebuke to a listening ear.
c76685	Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest [is] a trustworthy messenger to those who send him;
c76686	he refreshes the soul of his masters.
c76687	[Like] clouds and wind
c76688	without rain
c76689	[is] the man
c76690	who boasts of gifts never given.
c76691	Through patience a ruler can be persuaded,
c76692	and a gentle tongue can break a bone.
c76693	If you find honey,
c76694	eat just what you need,
c76695	lest you have too much
c76696	and vomit it up.
c76697	Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house,
c76698	lest he grow weary
c76699	and hate you.
c76700	[Like] a club or sword or sharp arrow [is] a man
c76701	who bears false witness against his neighbor.
c76702	[Like] a broken tooth or a foot out of joint is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble.
c76703	[Like] one who removes a garment on a cold day
c76704	or vinegar poured on soda
c76705	[is] one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
c76706	If your enemy is hungry,
c76707	give him food to eat,
c76708	and if he is thirsty,
c76709	give him water to drink.
c76710	For [in so doing], you will heap burning coals on his head,
c76711	and the LORD will reward you.
c76712	As the north wind brings forth rain,
c76713	so a backbiting tongue [brings] angry looks.
c76714	Better
c76715	to live on a corner of the roof
c76716	than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
c76717	[Like] cold water to a weary soul
c76718	[is] good news from a distant land.
c76719	Like a muddied spring or a polluted well is a righteous man
c76720	who gives way to the wicked.
c76721	to eat too much honey
c76722	It is not good
c76723	or to search out one’s own glory.
c76724	Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man ... does not
c76725	who ... control his temper.
c76726	Like snow in summer and rain at harvest,
c76727	honor does not befit a fool.
c76728	sparrow
c76729	Like a fluttering
c76730	swallow,
c76731	or darting
c76732	an undeserved curse does not come to rest.
c76733	A whip for the horse,
c76734	a bridle for the donkey,
c76735	and a rod for the backs of fools!
c76736	Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
c76737	or you yourself will be like him.
c76738	Answer a fool according to his folly,
c76739	lest he become wise in his own eyes.
c76740	Like cutting off one’s own feet
c76741	or drinking violence
c76742	is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool.
c76743	Like lame legs hanging limp
c76744	is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
c76745	Like binding a stone into a sling
c76746	is
c76747	the giving of honor to a fool.
c76748	[Like] a thorn [that] falls into the hand of a drunkard
c76749	is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
c76750	Like an archer who wounds at random
c76751	is he who hires a fool
c76752	or passer-by.
c76753	As a dog
c76754	returns to its vomit,
c76755	so a fool
c76756	repeats his folly.
c76757	Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes?
c76758	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
c76759	The slacker says,
c76760	“A lion [is] in the road!
c76761	A fierce lion [roams] the public square!”
c76762	[As] a door turns on its hinges,
c76763	so the sluggard [turns] on his bed.
c76764	The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
c76765	he is too lazy
c76766	to bring it back to his mouth.
c76767	The sluggard [is] wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer discreetly.
c76768	Like one who grabs a dog by the ears
c76769	is a passer-by
c76770	who meddles in a quarrel
c76771	not his own.
c76772	Like a madman
c76773	shooting firebrands and deadly arrows,
c76774	so is the man
c76775	who deceives his neighbor
c76776	and says,
c76777	“I was only joking!”
c76778	Without wood, a fire goes out;
c76779	without gossip, a conflict ceases.
c76780	Like charcoal for embers
c76781	and wood for fire,
c76782	so is a quarrelsome man
c76783	for kindling strife.
c76784	The words of a gossip are like choice morsels
c76785	that go down to the inmost being.
c76786	Like glaze
c76787	covering an earthen vessel
c76788	are burning lips and a wicked heart.
c76789	A hateful man disguises himself with his speech,
c76790	but he lays up deceit in his heart.
c76791	When he speaks graciously,
c76792	do not believe him,
c76793	for seven abominations [fill] his heart.
c76794	Though his hatred is concealed by deception,
c76795	his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
c76796	He who digs a pit
c76797	will fall into it,
c76798	and whoever rolls a stone,
c76799	it will come back on him.
c76800	A lying tongue hates those it crushes,
c76801	and a flattering mouth causes ruin.
c76802	Do not boast about tomorrow,
c76803	for you do not know
c76804	what a day may bring.
c76805	Let another praise you,
c76806	and not your own mouth—
c76807	a stranger,
c76808	and not your own lips.
c76809	A stone is heavy
c76810	and sand [is] a burden,
c76811	but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both.
c76812	Wrath [is] cruel and anger [is] like a flood,
c76813	but who can withstand jealousy?
c76814	Better an open rebuke than love that is concealed.
c76815	The wounds of a friend are faithful,
c76816	but the kisses of an enemy [are] deceitful.
c76817	The soul that is full loathes honey,
c76818	but to a hungry soul,
c76819	any bitter thing is sweet.
c76820	Like a bird
c76821	from its nest ... who wanders
c76822	[is] a man
c76823	that strays ... from his home.
c76824	Oil and incense bring joy to the heart,
c76825	and the sweetness of a friend [is] counsel to the soul.
c76826	Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend,
c76827	and do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity;
c76828	better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.
c76829	Be wise,
c76830	my son,
c76831	and bring joy to my heart,
c76832	so that I can answer him who taunts me.
c76833	The prudent see danger
c76834	and take cover;
c76835	[but] the simple keep going
c76836	[and] pay the penalty.
c76837	Take the garment
c76838	of him who posts security for a stranger;
c76839	get collateral if it is for a wayward woman.
c76840	If one blesses his neighbor with a loud voice
c76841	early in the morning,
c76842	it will be counted to him as a curse.
c76843	A constant dripping on a rainy day and a contentious woman are alike—
c76844	restraining her is like holding back the wind
c76845	or grasping oil with one’s right hand.
c76846	As iron sharpens iron,
c76847	so one man sharpens another.
c76848	Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
c76849	and he who looks after his master will be honored.
c76850	As water
c76851	reflects the face,
c76852	so the heart reflects the true man.
c76853	Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;
c76854	so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
c76855	A crucible for silver
c76856	and a furnace for gold,
c76857	but a man [is tested] by the praise accorded him.
c76858	Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,
c76859	[yet] his folly will not depart from him.
c76860	Be sure to know the state of your flocks,
c76861	and pay close attention to your herds;
c76862	for riches [are] not forever,
c76863	nor does a crown [endure] to every generation.
c76864	When hay is removed
c76865	and new growth appears
c76866	and the grain from the hills is gathered,
c76867	the lambs will provide you with clothing,
c76868	and the goats with the price of a field.
c76869	You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed you—
c76870	food for your household
c76871	and nourishment for your maidservants.
c76872	flee
c76873	when no one pursues,
c76874	The wicked
c76875	but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
c76876	A land in rebellion has many rulers,
c76877	but a man of understanding [and] knowledge maintains order.
c76878	A destitute leader who oppresses the poor ... rain
c76879	is like a driving
c76880	that leaves no food.
c76881	Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,
c76882	but those who keep the law resist them.
c76883	Evil men do not understand justice,
c76884	but those who seek the LORD comprehend fully.
c76885	Better a poor man
c76886	who walks with integrity
c76887	whose ways are perverse.
c76888	than a rich man
c76889	A discerning son keeps the law,
c76891	but a companion of gluttons
c76892	disgraces his father.
c76893	He who increases his wealth by interest and usury
c76894	lays it up for another, who will be kind to the poor.
c76895	Whoever turns his ear {away}
c76896	from hearing the law,
c76897	even his prayer is detestable.
c76898	He who leads the upright along the path of evil
c76899	will fall into his own pit,
c76900	but the blameless will inherit what is good.
c76901	A rich man is wise in his own eyes,
c76902	but a poor man with discernment sees through him.
c76903	When the righteous triumph,
c76904	there is great glory,
c76906	but when the wicked rise,
c76907	men hide themselves.
c76908	He who conceals his sins
c76909	will not prosper,
c76911	but whoever confesses
c76912	and renounces them
c76913	will find mercy.
c76914	Blessed [is] the man
c76915	who is always reverent,
c76917	but he who hardens his heart
c76918	falls into trouble.
c76919	Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.
c76920	A leader who lacks understanding
c76921	[is] also a great oppressor,
c76922	but he who hates dishonest profit will prolong [his] days.
c76923	A man
c76924	burdened by bloodguilt
c76925	will be a fugitive until death;
c76926	let no one support him.
c76927	He who walks with integrity
c76928	will be delivered,
c76929	but whoever is perverse [in his] ways will suddenly fall.
c76930	The one who works his land will have plenty of food,
c76931	but whoever chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
c76932	A faithful man will abound with blessings,
c76934	but one eager
c76935	to be rich
c76936	will not go unpunished.
c76937	To show partiality
c76938	[is] not good,
c76939	because a man may sin for a piece of bread.
c76940	A stingy man hastens after wealth
c76941	and does not know
c76942	that poverty awaits him.
c76943	He who rebukes a man will later find more favor than one who flatters with his tongue.
c76944	He who robs his father or mother,
c76945	saying,
c76946	“It is not wrong,”
c76947	is a companion to a man who destroys.
c76948	A greedy man stirs up strife,
c76950	but he who trusts in the LORD
c76951	will prosper.
c76952	He who trusts in himself
c76953	is a fool,
c76954	but one who walks in wisdom
c76955	will be safe.
c76956	Whoever gives to the poor
c76957	will not be in need,
c76958	but he who hides his eyes will receive many curses.
c76959	When the wicked come to power,
c76960	people hide themselves;
c76962	but when they perish,
c76963	the righteous flourish.
c76964	A man who ... after much reproof
c76965	remains stiff-necked
c76966	will suddenly be shattered
c76967	beyond recovery.
c76968	When the righteous flourish,
c76969	the people rejoice,
c76971	but when the wicked rule,
c76972	the people groan.
c76973	A man
c76974	who loves wisdom
c76975	brings joy to his father,
c76977	but a companion of prostitutes
c76978	squanders his wealth.
c76979	By justice a king gives stability to the land,
c76980	but a man who exacts tribute demolishes it.
c76981	A man
c76982	who flatters his neighbor ... for
c76983	spreads a net ... his feet.
c76984	An evil man is caught by his own sin,
c76985	but a righteous one sings
c76986	and rejoices.
c76987	The righteous consider the cause of the poor,
c76988	but the wicked have no regard for such concerns.
c76989	Mockers inflame a city,
c76990	but the wise turn away anger.
c76991	If a wise man goes to court with a fool,
c76992	there will be raving
c76993	and laughing
c76994	with no resolution.
c76995	Men of bloodshed hate a blameless man,
c76996	but the upright care for his life.
c76997	A fool vents all his anger,
c76998	but a wise man holds it back.
c76999	If a ruler
c77000	listens to lies,
c77001	all his officials will be wicked.
c77002	The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:
c77003	The LORD gives light to the eyes of both.
c77004	A king
c77005	who judges the poor with fairness—
c77006	his throne will be established forever.
c77007	A rod of correction imparts wisdom,
c77008	but a child left to himself disgraces his mother.
c77009	When the wicked thrive,
c77010	rebellion increases;
c77011	but the righteous will see their downfall.
c77012	Discipline your son,
c77013	and he will give you rest;
c77014	he will bring delight to your soul.
c77015	Where [there is] no vision, the people cast off restraint;
c77016	he who keeps the law.
c77017	but blessed [is]
c77018	A servant cannot be corrected by words [alone];
c77019	though he understands,
c77020	he will not respond.
c77021	Do you see a man
c77022	who speaks in haste?
c77023	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
c77024	A servant pampered from his youth
c77025	will bring grief in the end.
c77026	An angry man stirs up dissension,
c77027	and a hot-tempered man abounds in transgression.
c77028	A man’s pride will bring him low,
c77029	but a humble spirit will obtain honor.
c77030	A partner to a thief
c77031	hates his own soul;
c77032	he receives the oath,
c77033	but will not testify.
c77034	The fear of man is a snare,
c77036	but whoever trusts in the LORD
c77037	will be set securely on high.
c77038	Many seek the ruler’s favor,
c77039	but a man receives justice from the LORD.
c77040	An unjust man is detestable to the righteous,
c77041	and one whose way is upright is detestable to the wicked.
c77042	The words of Agur son of Jakeh,
c77043	the oracle
c77044	that this man declares to Ithiel— to Ithiel and Ucal:
c77045	“Surely I [am] the most ignorant of men,
c77046	and I lack the understanding of a man.
c77047	I have not learned wisdom,
c77048	and I have no knowledge of the Holy One.
c77049	Who has ascended to heaven
c77050	and come down?
c77051	Who has gathered the wind in His hands?
c77052	Who has bound up the waters in His cloak?
c77053	Who has established all the ends of the earth?
c77054	What is His name,
c77055	and what is the name of His Son—
c77056	surely you know!
c77057	Every word of God is pure;
c77058	He is a shield
c77059	to those who take refuge in Him.
c77060	Do not add to His words,
c77061	lest He rebuke you
c77062	and prove you a liar.
c77063	Two things I ask of You—
c77064	do not refuse me
c77065	before I die:
c77066	Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me.
c77067	Give me neither poverty nor riches;
c77068	feed me with the bread that is my portion.
c77069	Otherwise, I may have too much
c77070	and deny You,
c77071	saying,
c77072	“Who
c77073	is the LORD?” Or I may become poor
c77074	and steal,
c77075	profaning the name of my God.
c77076	Do not slander a servant to his master,
c77077	or he will curse you,
c77078	and you will bear the guilt.
c77079	There is a generation of those who curse their fathers
c77080	and do not bless their mothers.
c77081	There is a generation of those who are pure in their own eyes
c77082	and yet unwashed of their filth.
c77083	There is a generation—
c77084	how haughty are their eyes,
c77085	and pretentious are their glances—
c77086	there is a generation
c77087	whose teeth are swords
c77088	and whose jaws are knives,
c77089	devouring the oppressed from the earth, and the needy from [among] men.
c77090	The leech has two daughters:
c77091	Give
c77092	[and] Give.
c77093	There are three [things that] are never satisfied,
c77094	four [that] never say,
c77095	“Enough!”:
c77096	Sheol,
c77097	the barren womb,
c77098	land
c77099	that is never satisfied with water,
c77100	and fire
c77101	that never says,
c77102	“Enough!”
c77103	As for the eye
c77104	[that] mocks a father
c77105	and scorns obedience to a mother,
c77106	may the ravens of the valley pluck it out
c77107	and young vultures devour it.
c77108	There are three [things] too wonderful for me,
c77109	four
c77110	that I cannot understand:
c77111	the way of an eagle in the sky,
c77112	the way of a snake on a rock,
c77113	the way of a ship at sea,
c77114	and the way of a man with a maiden.
c77115	This is the way of an adulteress:
c77116	She eats
c77117	and wipes her mouth
c77118	and says,
c77119	“I have done no wrong.”
c77120	Under three things the earth trembles,
c77121	under four
c77122	it cannot
c77123	bear up:
c77124	a servant
c77125	who becomes king,
c77126	a fool
c77127	who is filled with food,
c77128	an unloved woman
c77129	who marries,
c77130	and a maidservant
c77131	who supplants her mistress.
c77132	Four things on earth are small, yet they
c77133	are exceedingly wise:
c77134	the ants ... species,
c77135	are not a strong
c77136	yet they store up their food in the summer;
c77137	the conies ... species,
c77138	are not a mighty
c77139	yet they make their homes in the rocks;
c77140	the locusts have no king,
c77141	advance
c77142	yet they all ... in formation;
c77143	and the lizard can be caught in one’s hands,
c77144	yet it [is found] in the palaces of kings.
c77145	There are three things that are stately in their stride,
c77146	and four that are impressive
c77147	in their walk:
c77148	a lion,
c77149	mighty among the beasts,
c77150	and refusing to retreat before anything;
c77151	a strutting rooster,
c77152	a he-goat,
c77153	and a king
c77154	with his army around him.
c77155	If you have foolishly
c77156	exalted yourself
c77157	or if you have plotted evil,
c77158	put your hand over your mouth.
c77159	For as the churning of milk yields butter,
c77160	and the twisting of the nose draws blood,
c77161	so the stirring of anger brings forth strife.
c77162	The words of King Lemuel—
c77163	an oracle
c77164	that his mother taught him:
c77165	What [shall I say],
c77166	O my son?
c77167	What,
c77168	O son of my womb?
c77169	What,
c77170	O son of my vows?
c77171	Do not spend your strength on women
c77172	or your vigor
c77173	on those who ruin kings.
c77174	It is not for kings,
c77175	O Lemuel,
c77176	it is not for kings
c77177	to drink wine,
c77178	or for rulers
c77179	[to crave] strong drink,
c77180	lest they drink
c77181	and forget what is decreed,
c77182	and deprive all the oppressed of justice.
c77183	Give strong drink to one who is perishing,
c77184	and wine to the bitter in soul.
c77185	Let him drink
c77186	and forget his poverty,
c77187	and remember his misery no more.
c77188	Open your mouth for those with no voice, for the justice of all the dispossessed.
c77189	Open your mouth,
c77190	judge righteously,
c77191	and defend the cause of the poor and needy.
c77192	a wife of noble character?
c77193	Who can find
c77194	She is far more precious than rubies.
c77195	The heart of her husband trusts in her,
c77196	and he will lack nothing of value.
c77197	She will bring him good
c77198	and not harm
c77199	all the days of her life.
c77200	She selects wool and flax
c77201	and works with eager hands.
c77202	She is like the merchant ships,
c77203	bringing her food from afar.
c77204	She rises while it is still night
c77205	to provide food for her household
c77206	and portions for her maidservants.
c77207	She appraises a field
c77208	and buys it;
c77209	from her earnings she plants a vineyard.
c77210	She girds herself with strength
c77211	and shows that her arms are strong.
c77212	She sees
c77213	that her gain [is] good,
c77214	and her lamp is not extinguished at night.
c77215	She stretches out her hands to the distaff
c77216	and grasps the spindle with her fingers.
c77217	She opens her arms to the poor
c77218	and reaches out her hands to the needy.
c77219	When it snows, she is not afraid for her household;
c77220	for [they are] all clothed in scarlet.
c77221	She makes coverings for her bed;
c77222	her clothing is fine linen and purple.
c77223	Her husband is known at the city gate,
c77224	where he sits among the elders of the land.
c77225	She makes linen garments
c77226	and sells [them];
c77227	she delivers sashes to the merchants.
c77228	Strength and honor are her clothing,
c77229	and she can laugh at the days to come.
c77230	She opens her mouth with wisdom,
c77231	and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
c77232	She watches over the affairs of her household
c77233	and does not eat the bread of idleness.
c77234	Her children rise up
c77235	and call her blessed;
c77236	her husband
c77237	praises her as well:
c77238	“Many daughters have done noble things,
c77239	but you surpass them all!”
c77240	Charm is deceptive
c77241	and beauty is fleeting,
c77242	but a woman who fears the LORD
c77243	is to be praised.
c77244	Give her the fruit of her hands,
c77245	and let her works praise her at the gates.
c77246	In the days ... there was
c77247	when the judges ruled,
c77248	a famine in the land.
c77249	And a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah, ... went
c77250	to reside in the land of Moab.
c77251	with his wife and two sons,
c77252	The man’s name was Elimelech,
c77253	his wife’s name was Naomi,
c77254	and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion.
c77255	They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah,
c77256	and they entered the land of Moab
c77257	and settled there.
c77258	Then Naomi’s husband Elimelech died,
c77259	and she was left with her two sons,
c77260	who took Moabite women as their wives,
c77261	one named Orpah
c77262	and the other named Ruth.
c77263	And after they had lived in Moab about ten years,
c77264	both Mahlon and Chilion also died,
c77265	and Naomi was left without her two sons and without her husband.
c77266	she and her daughters-in-law prepared
c77267	to leave the land of Moab.
c77268	When [Naomi] heard in Moab
c77269	that the LORD had attended to His people
c77270	by providing them with food,
c77271	So she left the place
c77272	where she was,
c77273	accompanied by her two daughters-in-law,
c77274	and set out on the road
c77275	leading back to the land of Judah.
c77276	Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law,
c77277	“Go
c77278	back,
c77279	each of you to your mother’s home.
c77280	May the LORD show you loving devotion,
c77281	as you have shown to your dead and to me.
c77282	May the LORD enable
c77283	to find security
c77284	each of you ... in the home of your new husband.”
c77285	And she kissed them
c77286	aloud
c77287	as they wept
c77288	and said,
c77289	“Surely we will return with you to your people.”
c77290	But Naomi replied,
c77291	“Return home,
c77292	my daughters.
c77293	Why would you go with me?
c77294	[Are] there still sons in my womb
c77295	to become your husbands?
c77296	Return home,
c77297	my daughters.
c77298	Go on,
c77299	for I am too old
c77300	to have another husband.
c77301	Even if I thought
c77302	there was hope for me
c77303	to have a husband tonight and
c77304	to bear sons,
c77305	would you wait for them
c77306	to grow up?
c77307	Would you refrain
c77308	from having husbands?
c77309	No,
c77310	my daughters,
c77311	it grieves me very much for
c77312	your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.”
c77313	aloud,
c77314	Again they wept
c77315	and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law {goodbye},
c77316	but Ruth clung to her.
c77317	said Naomi,
c77318	“Look,” ... “your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods;
c77319	follow [her] back home.”
c77320	But Ruth replied:
c77321	“Do not urge me
c77322	to leave you
c77323	[or] to turn from following you.
c77324	For
c77325	wherever you go,
c77326	I will go,
c77328	and wherever you live,
c77329	I will live;
c77330	your people will be my people,
c77331	and your God will be my God.
c77332	Where you die,
c77333	I will die,
c77334	and there I will be buried.
c77335	May the LORD punish me,
c77336	and ever so severely,
c77337	if
c77338	anything but death separates you and me.”
c77339	When Naomi saw
c77340	that Ruth was determined
c77341	to go with her,
c77342	she stopped
c77343	trying to persuade her.
c77344	So [Naomi and Ruth] traveled
c77345	until they came to Bethlehem.
c77346	When they
c77347	entered Bethlehem,
c77348	the whole city was stirred because of them,
c77349	and the women [of the city] exclaimed,
c77350	“Can this be Naomi?”
c77351	she replied.
c77352	“Do not call me Naomi,”
c77353	“Call me Mara,
c77354	because the Almighty has dealt quite bitterly with me.
c77355	I went away full,
c77356	but the LORD has brought me back empty.
c77357	Why call me Naomi,
c77358	since the LORD has testified against me,
c77359	and the Almighty has afflicted me?”
c77360	So Naomi returned
c77361	with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess.
c77362	from the land of Moab
c77363	And they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
c77364	Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a prominent man of noble character from the clan of Elimelech,
c77365	whose name [was] Boaz.
c77366	And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi,
c77367	“Please let me go into the fields
c77368	and glean heads of grain
c77369	behind [someone] in whose sight I may find favor.”
c77370	Naomi replied.
c77371	“Go ahead,
c77372	my daughter,”
c77373	So Ruth departed
c77374	and went out
c77375	into the field and gleaned after the harvesters.
c77376	And she happened to come
c77377	to the part of the field [belonging] to Boaz,
c77378	who [was] from the clan of Elimelech.
c77379	Just then
c77380	Boaz arrived from Bethlehem
c77381	and said to the harvesters,
c77382	“The LORD be with you.”
c77383	they replied.
c77384	“The LORD bless you,”
c77385	And Boaz asked the foreman
c77386	of his harvesters,
c77387	“Whose young woman is this?”
c77388	The foreman answered,
c77391	“She [is] the Moabitess
c77392	who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab.
c77393	She has said,
c77394	‘Please let me glean
c77395	and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.’
c77396	So she came out
c77397	and has continued from morning until now,
c77398	except that she rested a short time in the shelter.”
c77399	Then Boaz said to Ruth,
c77400	“Listen, ... do not
c77401	my daughter.
c77402	Do not go
c77403	and glean in another field,
c77404	and ... go away from this [place],
c77405	but stay here close to my servant girls.
c77406	[Let] your eyes [be on] ... field
c77407	[the] ... they are harvesting,
c77408	and follow along after [these girls].
c77409	Indeed, I have ordered the young men
c77410	not to touch you.
c77411	And when you are thirsty,
c77412	go ... the jars
c77413	and drink
c77414	from ... the young men have filled.”
c77415	At this, she fell on her face,
c77416	bowing low to the ground,
c77417	and said to him,
c77418	“Why have I found such favor in your eyes
c77419	that you should take notice of me,
c77420	even though I [am] a foreigner?”
c77421	Boaz replied,
c77423	“I have been made fully aware of all
c77424	you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband,
c77425	how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth,
c77426	and how you came to a people
c77427	you did not know before.
c77428	May the LORD repay your work,
c77429	and may you receive a rich reward from the LORD, the God of Israel,
c77430	whose ... you have taken
c77431	under ... wings ... refuge.”
c77432	she said,
c77433	“may I continue to find favor in your eyes,
c77434	“My lord,”
c77435	for you have comforted
c77436	and spoken kindly to your maidservant,
c77437	though I am not like one of your servant girls.”
c77438	At mealtime Boaz said to her,
c77439	“Come over here;
c77440	have some bread
c77441	and dip it into the vinegar sauce.”
c77442	So she sat down beside the harvesters,
c77443	and he offered her roasted grain,
c77444	and she ate
c77445	and was satisfied
c77446	and had some left over.
c77447	When [Ruth] got up
c77448	to glean,
c77449	Boaz ordered his young men,
c77451	“Even if she gathers among the sheaves,
c77452	do not insult her.
c77453	Rather, pull out for her [some stalks] from the bundles
c77454	and leave
c77455	them for her to gather.
c77456	Do not rebuke her.”
c77457	So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening.
c77458	And when she beat out
c77459	what she had gleaned,
c77460	it was about an ephah of barley.
c77461	She picked up the grain
c77462	and went into the town,
c77463	where her mother-in-law saw
c77464	what she had gleaned.
c77465	And she brought out
c77466	and gave it to [Naomi].
c77467	what she had saved from her meal
c77468	Then her mother-in-law asked her,
c77469	“Where did you glean today,
c77470	and where did you work?
c77471	Blessed be [the man] who noticed you.”
c77472	So she told her mother-in-law
c77473	where she had worked.
c77474	she said.
c77475	“The name of the man
c77476	I worked with today
c77477	is Boaz,”
c77478	Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law,
c77479	“May he be blessed by the LORD,
c77480	who has not withdrawn his kindness from the living or the dead.”
c77481	Naomi continued,
c77482	“The man is a close relative.
c77483	He [is] one of our kinsman-redeemers.”
c77484	Then Ruth the Moabitess said,
c77485	“He also told me,
c77486	with my young men
c77488	‘Stay
c77489	until they have finished gathering all my harvest.’”
c77491	And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth,
c77492	it is good
c77493	“My daughter,
c77494	for you to work with his young women,
c77495	so that nothing will happen to you in another field.”
c77496	So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz
c77497	to glean
c77498	grain until the barley and wheat harvests were finished.
c77499	And she lived with her mother-in-law.
c77500	One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her,
c77501	“My daughter,
c77502	should I not seek a place for you,
c77503	that it may be well with you?
c77504	Now
c77505	is not Boaz, ... a relative of ours?
c77506	with whose servant girls you have been [working],
c77507	In fact, tonight he is winnowing barley on the threshing floor.
c77508	Therefore wash yourself,
c77509	put on perfume,
c77510	and wear your best clothes.
c77511	Go down to the threshing floor,
c77512	but do not let the man know
c77513	you are there until he has finished
c77514	eating
c77515	and drinking.
c77517	When he lies down,
c77518	note the place
c77519	where he lies.
c77520	Then go in
c77521	and uncover his feet,
c77522	and lie down,
c77523	and he will explain
c77524	to you what you should do.”
c77525	Ruth answered.
c77526	everything
c77527	you say,”
c77528	“I will do
c77529	So she went down to the threshing floor
c77530	and did everything
c77531	her mother-in-law had instructed her.
c77532	After Boaz had finished eating
c77533	and drinking
c77534	and was in good spirits,
c77535	he went
c77536	to lie down at the end of the heap of grain.
c77537	Then [Ruth] went in secretly,
c77538	uncovered his feet,
c77539	and lay down.
c77540	At midnight,
c77541	Boaz was startled,
c77542	turned over,
c77543	and there
c77544	lying at his feet was a woman!
c77545	he asked.
c77546	“Who are you?”
c77547	she replied.
c77548	“I [am] your servant Ruth,”
c77549	“Spread the corner of your garment over me,
c77550	for you are a kinsman-redeemer.”
c77551	Then [Boaz] said,
c77552	“May the LORD bless you,
c77553	my daughter.
c77554	You have shown more kindness now than before,
c77555	because you have not run after the younger men,
c77556	whether ... poor.
c77557	rich or
c77558	And now
c77559	my daughter.
c77560	do not be afraid,
c77561	whatever
c77562	you request,
c77563	I will do for you
c77564	since all my fellow townspeople know
c77565	that you are a woman of noble character.
c77567	Yes, it is true
c77568	that I [am] a kinsman-redeemer,
c77569	but there is a redeemer
c77570	nearer than I.
c77571	Stay here tonight,
c77572	and in the morning,
c77573	if he wants to redeem you,
c77574	good.
c77575	Let him redeem you.
c77576	But if he does not want
c77577	to redeem you,
c77578	I will.
c77579	as surely as the LORD lives,
c77580	Now lie here until morning.”
c77581	So she lay down at his feet until morning,
c77582	but she got up
c77583	before anyone else could recognize her.
c77584	Then Boaz said,
c77585	“Do not let it be known
c77586	that a woman came to the threshing floor.”
c77587	And he told her,
c77588	“Bring the shawl
c77589	you are wearing
c77590	and hold it out.”
c77591	When she [did so],
c77592	he shoveled six measures of barley
c77593	into her shawl.
c77594	Then he went into the city.
c77595	When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law,
c77596	Naomi asked her,
c77597	“How did it go,
c77598	my daughter?”
c77599	Then Ruth told her all
c77600	that [Boaz] had done for her.
c77601	And she said,
c77602	“He gave me these six measures of barley,
c77603	for he said, ... to
c77604	‘Do not go back ... your mother-in-law empty-handed.’”
c77605	said Naomi,
c77606	“Wait,
c77607	my daughter,”
c77608	“until you find out
c77609	how things go,
c77610	for he will not rest
c77611	unless he has resolved the matter today.”
c77612	Meanwhile Boaz went to the gate
c77613	and sat down there.
c77614	Soon the kinsman-redeemer ... came along,
c77615	of whom [he] had spoken
c77616	and Boaz said,
c77617	“Come over
c77618	here, ... and sit down.”
c77619	my friend,
c77620	So he went over
c77621	and sat down.
c77622	Then Boaz took ten of the elders of the city
c77623	and said,
c77624	“Sit here,”
c77625	and they did so.
c77626	And he said to the kinsman-redeemer,
c77627	from the land ... a piece
c77628	that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
c77629	“Naomi, ... is selling
c77630	who has returned ... of Moab, ... of land
c77631	I thought
c77632	I should inform you
c77633	he replied.
c77634	that you may buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people.
c77635	If you want to redeem it,
c77636	do so.
c77637	But if you will not redeem [it],
c77638	tell me
c77639	so I may know,
c77640	because [there is] no one but you
c77641	to redeem [it],
c77642	and I [am] next after you.”
c77644	“I will redeem [it],”
c77645	Then Boaz said,
c77646	“On the day
c77647	you buy the land from Naomi
c77648	and also from Ruth the Moabitess, you must also acquire the widow of the deceased
c77649	in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.”
c77650	The kinsman-redeemer replied,
c77651	“I cannot
c77652	redeem it myself,
c77653	or I would jeopardize my own inheritance.
c77654	Take my right of redemption,
c77655	because I cannot
c77656	redeem it.”
c77657	(Now in former times in Israel, concerning the redemption or exchange of property,
c77658	to make any matter legally binding
c77659	a man would remove his sandal
c77660	and give it to the other party,
c77661	and this [was] a confirmation in Israel.)
c77662	So the kinsman-redeemer ... and said to Boaz,
c77663	“Buy [it] for yourself.”
c77664	removed his sandal
c77665	At this, Boaz said to the elders and all the people,
c77666	“You are witnesses today
c77667	that I am buying ... all
c77668	that belonged to Elimelech,
c77670	Chilion, and Mahlon.
c77671	from Naomi
c77672	Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife,
c77673	to raise up the name of the deceased through his inheritance,
c77674	so that his name will not disappear from among his brothers or from the gate of his home.
c77675	You are witnesses today.”
c77676	said ... and all the people
c77677	at the gate.
c77678	the elders
c77679	“We are witnesses,”
c77680	“May the LORD make the woman
c77681	entering your home
c77682	like Rachel and Leah,
c77683	who together built up the house of Israel.
c77684	May you be prosperous in Ephrathah
c77685	and famous in Bethlehem.
c77686	And may your house become like the house of Perez,
c77687	whom Tamar bore to Judah,
c77688	because of the offspring
c77689	the LORD will give you by this young woman.”
c77690	So Boaz took Ruth
c77691	and she became his wife.
c77692	And he had relations with her,
c77693	the LORD enabled her to conceive,
c77694	and she gave birth to a son.
c77695	Then the women said to Naomi,
c77696	“Blessed [be] the LORD,
c77697	who has not left you this day without a kinsman-redeemer.
c77698	May his name become famous in Israel.
c77699	He will renew your life
c77700	and sustain you in your old age.
c77701	For your daughter-in-law,
c77702	who loves
c77703	has given him birth.”
c77704	you and is better to you than seven sons,
c77705	And Naomi took the child,
c77706	placed him on her lap,
c77707	and became a nurse to him.
c77708	The neighbor ... and they named him
c77709	women said,
c77710	“A son has been born to Naomi,”
c77711	Obed.
c77712	He [became] the father of Jesse, the father of David.
c77713	Now these [are] the generations of Perez:
c77714	Perez was the father of Hezron,
c77715	Hezron was the father of Ram,
c77716	Ram was the father of Amminadab,
c77717	Amminadab was the father of Nahshon,
c77718	Nahshon was the father of Salmon,
c77719	Salmon was the father of Boaz,
c77720	Boaz was the father of Obed,
c77721	Obed was the father of Jesse,
c77722	and Jesse was the father of David.
c77723	Song of Songs.
c77724	Solomon’s
c77725	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!
c77726	For your love is more delightful than wine.
c77727	The fragrance of your perfume is pleasing;
c77728	is like perfume
c77729	poured out.
c77730	your name
c77731	No wonder the maidens adore you.
c77732	Take me
c77733	away with you— let us hurry!
c77734	May the king bring me to his chambers.
c77735	We will rejoice
c77736	and delight in you;
c77737	we will praise your love above wine.
c77738	It is only right that they adore you.
c77739	I am dark
c77740	yet lovely,
c77741	O daughters of Jerusalem,
c77742	like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
c77743	Do not stare
c77744	because I am dark,
c77745	for the sun has looked upon me.
c77746	My mother’s sons were angry with me;
c77747	they made
c77748	me a keeper of the vineyards,
c77749	[but] my own vineyard
c77751	I have neglected.
c77752	Tell me, O one
c77753	I love,
c77754	where do you pasture your sheep?
c77755	Where do you rest them at midday?
c77756	Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your companions?
c77757	If you do not know,
c77758	O fairest of women,
c77759	follow the tracks of the flock,
c77760	and graze your young goats near the tents of the shepherds.
c77761	I compare you, ... to a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots.
c77762	my darling,
c77763	Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments,
c77764	your neck with strings [of jewels].
c77765	We will make you ornaments of gold, [studded] with beads of silver.
c77766	While the king was at his table,
c77767	my perfume spread its fragrance.
c77768	My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh
c77769	resting between my breasts.
c77770	My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En-gedi.
c77771	How beautiful [you are],
c77772	my darling!
c77773	Oh, how very beautiful!
c77774	Your eyes are [like] doves.
c77775	How handsome [you are],
c77776	my beloved!
c77777	Oh, how delightful!
c77778	The soft grass [is] our bed.
c77779	The beams of our house are cedars;
c77780	our rafters [are] fragrant firs.
c77781	I am a rose of Sharon,
c77782	a lily of the valley.
c77783	Like a lily among the thorns
c77784	is my darling among the maidens.
c77785	Like an apricot tree among the trees of the forest
c77786	is my beloved among the young men.
c77787	I delight ... in his shade,
c77788	to sit
c77789	and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
c77790	He has brought me to the banquet hall,
c77791	and his banner over me [is] love.
c77792	Sustain me with raisins;
c77793	refresh me with apples,
c77794	for I am faint with love.
c77795	His left hand is under my head,
c77796	and his right arm embraces me.
c77797	I adjure you
c77798	O daughters of Jerusalem,
c77799	by the gazelles and does of the field:
c77800	Do not arouse
c77801	or awaken love
c77802	until the time is right.
c77803	Listen! My beloved [approaches].
c77804	Look! Here he comes,
c77805	leaping across the mountains,
c77806	bounding over the hills.
c77807	My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.
c77808	Look, he stands behind our wall,
c77809	gazing through the windows,
c77810	peering through the lattice.
c77811	My beloved calls
c77812	to me,
c77813	“Arise,
c77814	my darling. ... my beautiful one.
c77815	Come away with me,
c77816	For now the winter is past;
c77817	the rain is over
c77818	and gone.
c77819	The flowers have appeared in the countryside;
c77820	the season of singing has come,
c77821	and the cooing of turtledoves is heard in our land.
c77822	The fig tree ripens its figs;
c77823	the blossoming vines spread their fragrance.
c77824	Arise, come away,
c77825	my darling; ... my beautiful one.”
c77826	come with me,
c77827	O my dove in the clefts of the rock, in the crevices of the cliff,
c77828	let me see your face,
c77829	let me hear your voice;
c77830	for your voice is sweet,
c77831	and your countenance is lovely.
c77832	Catch for us the foxes— the little foxes
c77833	that ruin the vineyards—
c77834	for our vineyards are in bloom.
c77835	My beloved is mine
c77836	and I am his;
c77837	he pastures [his flock] among the lilies.
c77838	Before the day breaks
c77839	and shadows flee,
c77840	turn to me,
c77841	and be like
c77842	my beloved,
c77843	a gazelle
c77844	or a young stag on the mountains of Bether.
c77845	On my bed at night I sought
c77846	the one I love;
c77847	I sought him
c77848	but did not find him.
c77849	I will arise now
c77850	and go about the city, through the streets and squares.
c77851	I will seek
c77852	the one I love.
c77853	So I sought him
c77854	but did not find him.
c77855	I encountered the watchmen
c77856	on their rounds of the city:
c77857	I love?”
c77858	“Have you seen [the one]
c77859	I had just
c77860	passed them
c77861	when I found
c77862	the one I love.
c77863	I held him
c77864	and would not let go
c77865	until I had brought him to my mother’s house, to the chamber of the one who conceived me.
c77866	I charge you
c77867	O daughters of Jerusalem,
c77868	by the gazelles and does of the field:
c77869	Do not arouse
c77870	or awaken love
c77871	until the time is right.
c77872	Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke,
c77873	scented with myrrh and frankincense from all the spices of the merchant?
c77874	Behold, ... carriage,
c77875	it is Solomon’s
c77876	escorted by sixty warriors from the valiant of Israel.
c77877	All are skilled with the sword,
c77878	experienced in warfare.
c77879	Each
c77880	has his sword at his side prepared for the terror of night.
c77881	King Solomon has made his carriage out of the timber of Lebanon.
c77882	He has made its posts of silver,
c77883	its base of gold,
c77884	its seat of purple [fabric].
c77885	Its interior is inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.
c77886	Come out,
c77887	and gaze
c77888	O daughters of Zion,
c77889	at King Solomon,
c77890	wearing the crown
c77891	his mother bestowed on the day of his wedding— the day of his heart’s rejoicing.
c77892	How beautiful [you are],
c77893	my darling!
c77894	How very beautiful!
c77895	Your eyes are [like] doves behind your veil.
c77896	Your hair is like a flock of goats
c77897	streaming down Mount Gilead.
c77898	Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheep
c77899	coming up from the washing;
c77900	each has its twin,
c77901	and not one [is] lost.
c77902	Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon,
c77903	and your mouth is lovely.
c77904	Your brow is like a slice of pomegranate behind your veil.
c77905	Your neck is like the tower of David,
c77906	built with rows of stones;
c77907	on it hang a thousand shields,
c77908	all round shields of the warriors.
c77909	Your breasts are like two fawns,
c77910	twins of a gazelle
c77911	grazing among the lilies.
c77912	Before the day breaks
c77913	and shadows flee,
c77914	I will make my way to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.
c77915	You are altogether beautiful,
c77916	my darling;
c77917	in you [there is] no flaw.
c77918	with me from Lebanon,
c77919	my bride,
c77920	Come ... [come] with me from Lebanon!
c77921	Descend the peak of Amana, from the summits of Senir and Hermon,
c77922	from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.
c77923	You have captured my heart,
c77924	my sister, my bride;
c77925	you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes,
c77926	with one jewel of your neck.
c77927	How delightful [is] your love,
c77928	my sister, my bride.
c77929	Your love is much better than wine,
c77930	and the fragrance of your perfume than all spices.
c77931	Your lips, ... drip sweetness like the honeycomb;
c77932	my bride,
c77933	honey and milk are under your tongue,
c77934	and the fragrance of your garments is like the aroma of Lebanon.
c77935	[you are] a garden locked up,
c77936	My sister, my bride,
c77937	a spring enclosed,
c77938	a fountain sealed.
c77939	Your branches [are] an orchard of pomegranates with the choicest of fruits,
c77940	with henna [and] nard,
c77941	with nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree,
c77942	with myrrh and aloes, with all the finest spices.
c77943	You are a garden spring,
c77944	a well of flowing water
c77945	streaming down from Lebanon.
c77946	Awaken,
c77947	O north wind,
c77948	and come,
c77949	O south wind.
c77950	Breathe on my garden,
c77951	and spread the fragrance of its spices.
c77952	Let my beloved come into his garden
c77953	and taste its choicest fruits.
c77954	I have come to my garden,
c77955	my sister, my bride;
c77956	I have gathered my myrrh with my spice.
c77957	I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
c77958	I have drunk my wine with my milk.
c77959	Eat,
c77960	O friends,
c77961	[and] drink;
c77962	drink freely,
c77963	O beloved.
c77964	I sleep,
c77965	but my heart is awake.
c77966	A sound! My beloved
c77967	is knocking:
c77968	“Open to me,
c77969	my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one.”
c77970	My head is drenched with dew,
c77971	my hair with the dampness of the night.
c77972	I have taken off my robe—
c77973	must I put it back on?
c77974	I have washed my feet—
c77975	must I soil them again?
c77976	My beloved put his hand to the latch;
c77977	my heart pounded for him.
c77978	I rose up
c77979	to open for my beloved.
c77980	My hands dripped with myrrh,
c77981	my fingers with flowing myrrh on the handles of the bolt.
c77982	I opened for my beloved,
c77983	but [he] had turned
c77984	and gone.
c77985	My heart sank
c77986	at his departure.
c77987	I sought him,
c77988	but did not find him.
c77989	I called,
c77990	but he did not answer.
c77991	I encountered the watchmen
c77992	on their rounds of the city.
c77993	They beat me
c77994	and bruised me;
c77995	they took away my cloak, those guardians of the walls.
c77996	I adjure you,
c77997	O daughters of Jerusalem,
c77998	if you find my beloved,
c77999	tell him
c78000	I [am] sick with love.
c78001	How [is] your beloved better than [others],
c78002	O most beautiful among women?
c78003	How [is] your beloved better than another,
c78004	that you charge us so?
c78005	My beloved is dazzling and ruddy,
c78006	outstanding among ten thousand.
c78007	His head is purest gold;
c78008	his hair is wavy
c78009	and black as a raven.
c78010	His eyes are like doves beside the streams of water,
c78011	bathed in milk
c78012	[and] mounted like jewels.
c78013	His cheeks are like beds of spice,
c78014	towers of perfume.
c78015	His lips are like lilies,
c78016	dripping with flowing myrrh.
c78017	His arms are rods of gold
c78018	set with chrysolite.
c78019	His body is an ivory panel
c78020	bedecked with sapphires.
c78021	His legs [are] pillars of marble
c78022	set on bases of pure gold.
c78023	His appearance is like Lebanon,
c78024	as majestic as the cedars.
c78025	His mouth [is] most sweet;
c78026	he is altogether lovely.
c78027	This [is] my beloved,
c78028	and this is my friend,
c78029	O daughters of Jerusalem.
c78030	Where has your beloved gone,
c78031	O most beautiful among women?
c78032	Which way has he turned?
c78033	We will seek him with you.
c78034	My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices,
c78035	to pasture [his flock] in the gardens,
c78036	and to gather lilies.
c78037	I belong to my beloved
c78038	and [he] belongs to me;
c78039	he pastures [his flock] among the lilies.
c78040	You are beautiful,
c78041	my darling,
c78042	as Tirzah,
c78043	lovely as Jerusalem,
c78044	majestic as an army with banners.
c78045	Turn your eyes away from me,
c78046	for they have overcome me.
c78047	Your hair is like a flock of goats
c78048	streaming down from Gilead.
c78049	Your teeth are like a flock of sheep
c78050	coming up from the washing;
c78051	each has its twin,
c78052	and not one [is] lost.
c78053	Your brow behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate.
c78054	There are sixty queens
c78055	and eighty concubines,
c78056	and maidens
c78057	without number,
c78058	but my dove, my perfect ... is unique,
c78059	one, ... of the mother
c78060	the favorite ... who bore her.
c78061	The maidens see her
c78062	and call her blessed;
c78063	the queens and concubines
c78064	sing her praises.
c78065	Who is this
c78066	who shines like the dawn,
c78067	as fair as the moon,
c78068	as bright as the sun,
c78069	as majestic as the stars in procession?
c78070	I went down to the walnut grove
c78071	to see the blossoms of the valley,
c78072	to see
c78073	if the vines were budding,
c78074	or the pomegranates in bloom.
c78075	Before I realized it,
c78076	my desire had set me among the chariots of my noble people.
c78077	Come back,
c78078	come back,
c78079	O Shulammite!
c78080	Come back,
c78081	come back,
c78082	that we may gaze upon you.
c78083	Why do you look at the Shulammite, as on the dance of Mahanaim?
c78084	How beautiful are your sandaled feet,
c78085	O daughter of the prince!
c78086	The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the handiwork of a master.
c78087	Your navel is a rounded goblet;
c78088	it never lacks blended wine.
c78089	Your waist is a mound of wheat
c78090	encircled by the lilies.
c78091	Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
c78092	Your neck is like a tower [made] of ivory;
c78093	your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim;
c78094	your nose is like the tower of Lebanon
c78095	facing toward Damascus.
c78096	Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel,
c78097	the hair of your head like purple [threads];
c78098	the king is captured in your tresses.
c78099	How fair
c78100	and how pleasant [you are],
c78101	O love,
c78102	with your delights!
c78103	Your stature is like a palm tree;
c78104	your breasts are clusters of fruit.
c78105	I said,
c78106	“I will climb the palm tree;
c78107	I will take hold of its fruit.”
c78108	May your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
c78109	the fragrance of your breath like apples,
c78110	and your mouth like the finest wine.
c78111	May it flow smoothly to my beloved,
c78112	gliding gently over lips and teeth.
c78113	I belong to my beloved,
c78114	and his desire is for me.
c78115	Come,
c78116	my beloved,
c78117	let us go to the countryside;
c78118	let us spend the night in the villages.
c78119	Let us go early to the vineyards
c78120	to see
c78121	if the vine has budded,
c78122	if the blossom has opened,
c78123	if the pomegranates are in bloom—
c78124	there I will give you my love.
c78125	The mandrakes send forth a fragrance,
c78126	and at our door is every delicacy, new as well as old,
c78127	my beloved.
c78128	that I have treasured up for you,
c78129	O that you [were] to me like a brother
c78130	who nursed at my mother’s breasts!
c78131	If I found you outdoors,
c78132	I would kiss you,
c78133	and no one would despise me.
c78134	I would lead you
c78135	and bring you to the house of my mother
c78136	who taught me.
c78137	I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.
c78138	His left hand is under my head,
c78139	and his right arm embraces me.
c78140	I adjure you:
c78141	O daughters of Jerusalem,
c78142	Do not arouse
c78143	or awaken love
c78144	until the time is right.
c78145	Who is this coming up from the wilderness,
c78146	leaning on her beloved?
c78147	I roused you under the apple tree;
c78148	there your mother conceived you,
c78149	there she travailed
c78150	and brought you forth.
c78151	Set me as a seal over your heart,
c78152	as a seal upon your arm.
c78153	For love is as strong as death,
c78154	jealousy as unrelenting as Sheol.
c78155	Its sparks are fiery flames, the fiercest blaze of all.
c78156	Mighty waters cannot
c78157	quench love;
c78158	rivers cannot sweep it away.
c78159	If a man were to give all the riches of his house for love,
c78160	it would be utterly scorned.
c78161	We have a little sister,
c78162	and her breasts are not yet grown.
c78163	What shall we do for our sister on the day
c78164	she is spoken for?
c78165	If she is a wall,
c78166	we will build a tower of silver to protect her.
c78167	If she is a door,
c78168	we will enclose her with panels of cedar.
c78169	I am a wall
c78170	and my breasts are like towers.
c78171	So I have become in his eyes like one who brings peace.
c78172	Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon.
c78173	He leased [it] to the tenants.
c78174	For its fruit, each was to bring a thousand [shekels] of silver.
c78175	[But] my own vineyard
c78177	is mine to give;
c78178	the thousand [shekels] are for you,
c78179	O Solomon,
c78180	and two hundred
c78181	are for those who tend its fruit.
c78182	You who dwell in the gardens,
c78183	[my] companions are listening for your voice.
c78184	Let me hear it!
c78185	Come away,
c78186	my beloved,
c78187	and be like a gazelle
c78188	or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
c78189	The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
c78190	“Futility of futilities,”
c78191	says the Teacher,
c78192	“futility of futilities!
c78193	Everything is futile!”
c78194	What does a man gain from all his labor,
c78195	at which he toils under the sun?
c78196	Generations come
c78197	and generations go,
c78198	but the earth remains forever.
c78199	The sun rises
c78200	and the sun sets;
c78201	it hurries back to
c78202	where it arose.
c78203	Blowing southward,
c78204	then turning northward,
c78205	round
c78206	[and] round
c78207	the wind swirls,
c78208	ever returning on [its] course.
c78209	All the rivers flow into the sea,
c78210	yet the sea
c78211	is never full;
c78212	to the place
c78213	from which the streams come,
c78214	there again they
c78215	flow.
c78216	All things are wearisome,
c78217	more than one
c78218	can describe;
c78219	the eye is not satisfied
c78220	with seeing,
c78221	nor the ear content
c78222	with hearing.
c78223	What
c78224	has been
c78225	is what
c78226	will be,
c78227	and what
c78228	has been done
c78230	will be done again;
c78231	there is nothing new under the sun.
c78232	Is there [a case]
c78233	where one can say,
c78234	“Look,
c78235	this
c78236	is new”? It
c78237	has already existed in the ages
c78238	before us.
c78239	There is no remembrance of those who came before,
c78240	and those to come
c78241	will not be
c78242	remembered ... follow
c78243	by those who ... after.
c78244	I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
c78245	And I set my mind
c78246	to seek
c78247	and explore by wisdom all
c78248	that is done under heaven.
c78249	What a heavy burden
c78250	God has laid on the sons of men,
c78251	to keep them occupied!
c78252	I have seen all the things
c78253	that are done under the sun,
c78254	and have found
c78255	them all to be futile,
c78256	a pursuit of the wind.
c78257	What is crooked cannot
c78258	be straightened,
c78259	and what is lacking cannot
c78260	be counted.
c78261	I said to myself,
c78263	I
c78264	“Behold, ... have grown
c78265	and increased in wisdom beyond all
c78266	those before me who were over Jerusalem,
c78267	and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”
c78268	So I set my mind
c78269	to know wisdom [and] madness and folly;
c78270	I learned
c78271	that ... too,
c78272	this, ... is a pursuit of the wind.
c78273	For with much wisdom comes much sorrow,
c78274	and as knowledge grows,
c78275	grief increases.
c78276	I said to myself,
c78277	“Come now,
c78278	I will test you with pleasure;
c78279	enjoy what is good!”
c78280	proved
c78281	But it ... to be futile.
c78282	I said of laughter,
c78283	“It is folly,”
c78284	and of pleasure,
c78285	“What does it accomplish?”
c78286	My mind, ... sought
c78287	to cheer my body with wine
c78288	[all the while] guiding me with wisdom,
c78289	and embrace folly,
c78290	until I could see
c78291	what [was] worthwhile for men
c78292	to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.
c78293	I enlarged my works.
c78294	I built myself houses
c78295	and planted myself vineyards.
c78296	I made myself gardens and parks
c78297	and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
c78298	I built reservoirs
c78299	to water my groves of flourishing trees.
c78300	I acquired menservants and maidservants,
c78301	and servants were born in my house. ... owned
c78302	I also ... more herds and flocks than anyone
c78303	in Jerusalem before me,
c78304	and I accumulated for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces.
c78305	I gathered to myself male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men— many concubines.
c78306	So I became great
c78307	and surpassed all
c78308	in Jerusalem who had preceded me;
c78309	and my wisdom remained with me.
c78310	Anything
c78311	my eyes desired,
c78312	I did not deny myself.
c78313	I refused my heart no pleasure.
c78314	For my heart took delight in all my work,
c78315	and this was the reward for all my labor.
c78316	Yet when I considered all the works
c78317	that my hands had accomplished
c78318	and [what]
c78319	I had toiled
c78320	to achieve,
c78321	I found
c78322	everything to be futile,
c78323	a pursuit of the wind;
c78324	there was nothing to be gained under the sun.
c78325	Then I turned
c78326	to consider wisdom and madness and folly;
c78327	for what [more]
c78328	can the king’s successor
c78329	do than what has already been accomplished?
c78330	And I saw
c78331	that wisdom exceeds folly,
c78332	just as light exceeds darkness:
c78333	The wise
c78334	man has eyes in his head,
c78335	but the fool walks in darkness.
c78336	Yet I also came to realize
c78337	that one fate overcomes them both.
c78338	So I said to myself,
c78339	“The fate of the fool
c78340	will also ... have I
c78341	befall me.
c78342	What then ... gained by being wise?”
c78343	And I said to myself
c78344	that this too is futile.
c78345	For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise, just as with the fool,
c78346	seeing that both will be forgotten in the days to come.
c78347	Alas, the wise man will die just like the fool!
c78348	So I hated life,
c78349	because the work ... was grievous to me.
c78350	that is done under the sun
c78351	For everything is futile
c78352	and a pursuit of the wind.
c78353	I hated all ... I had toiled
c78354	for which ... under the sun,
c78355	because I must leave it to the man
c78356	who comes after me.
c78357	And who knows
c78358	whether he will be a wise
c78359	man or a fool?
c78360	Yet he will take over all the labor
c78361	at which I have worked
c78362	skillfully under the sun.
c78363	This too is futile.
c78364	So ... began
c78365	my heart ... to despair over all the labor
c78366	that I had done under the sun.
c78367	When there is a man
c78368	who has labored with wisdom, knowledge, and skill,
c78369	to a man
c78370	who has not worked for it,
c78371	and he must give his portion
c78372	this too is futile
c78373	and a great evil.
c78374	For what does a man get for all the labor and endeavors
c78375	at which he toils under the sun?
c78376	Indeed, all his days are filled with grief,
c78377	and his task is sorrowful;
c78378	even at night, his mind does not rest.
c78379	This too
c78380	is futile.
c78381	Nothing [is] better for man
c78382	than to eat
c78383	and drink
c78384	and ... his work.
c78385	enjoy ... I have also ... this [is]
c78386	seen that ... from the hand of God.
c78387	For ... who can eat
c78388	apart from Him, ... and who can find enjoyment?
c78389	To the man
c78390	who is pleasing in His sight,
c78391	He gives wisdom and knowledge and joy,
c78392	but to the sinner He assigns the task
c78393	of gathering
c78394	and accumulating [that which]
c78395	he will hand over to one who pleases God.
c78396	This too is futile
c78397	and a pursuit of the wind.
c78398	To everything there is a season,
c78399	and a time for every purpose under heaven:
c78400	a time
c78401	to be born
c78402	and a time
c78403	to die,
c78404	a time
c78405	to plant
c78406	and a time
c78407	to uproot,
c78408	a time
c78409	to kill
c78410	and a time
c78411	to heal,
c78412	a time
c78413	to break down
c78414	and a time
c78415	to build,
c78416	a time
c78417	to weep
c78418	and a time
c78419	to laugh,
c78420	a time
c78421	to mourn
c78422	and a time
c78423	to dance,
c78424	a time
c78425	to cast away stones
c78426	and a time
c78427	to gather stones [together],
c78428	a time
c78429	to embrace
c78430	and a time
c78431	to refrain
c78432	from embracing,
c78433	a time
c78434	to search
c78435	and a time
c78436	to count as lost,
c78437	a time
c78438	to keep
c78439	and a time
c78440	to discard,
c78441	a time
c78442	to tear
c78443	and a time
c78444	to mend,
c78445	a time
c78446	to be silent
c78447	and a time
c78448	to speak,
c78449	a time
c78450	to love
c78451	and a time
c78452	to hate,
c78453	a time for war
c78454	and a time for peace.
c78455	What does the worker gain
c78456	from his toil?
c78457	I have seen the burden
c78458	that God has laid on men
c78459	to occupy them.
c78460	He has made everything beautiful in its time.
c78461	He has also set eternity in the hearts [of men],
c78462	yet [they] cannot fathom the work
c78463	God has done from beginning to end.
c78464	I know
c78465	that there is nothing better
c78466	for [men] than to rejoice
c78467	and do good while they live,
c78468	and also that every man
c78469	should eat
c78470	and drink
c78471	and find satisfaction in all his labor—
c78472	this is the gift of God.
c78473	I know
c78474	that everything
c78475	God does
c78476	will remain forever;
c78477	to it
c78478	nothing
c78479	can be added
c78480	from it.
c78482	or taken
c78483	God works
c78484	that men should revere Him.
c78485	What exists
c78486	been,
c78487	has already
c78489	and what will be
c78490	has already been,
c78491	for God will call to account what has passed.
c78492	Furthermore, I saw under the sun
c78493	that in the place of judgment
c78494	there is wickedness,
c78495	and in the place of righteousness
c78496	there is wickedness.
c78497	I said in my heart,
c78498	“God will judge the righteous and the wicked,
c78499	since there is a time for every activity
c78500	and every deed.”
c78501	I said to myself, “As for the sons of men,
c78502	God tests them
c78503	so that they may see
c78504	for themselves ... are but beasts.”
c78505	that they
c78506	For the fates of [both] men [and] beasts
c78507	are the same:
c78508	As one dies,
c78509	so dies the other—
c78510	they all have the same breath.
c78511	Man has no advantage over the animals,
c78512	since everything is futile.
c78513	All go to one place:
c78514	All come from dust,
c78515	and all return to dust.
c78516	Who knows
c78517	if the spirit of man
c78518	rises
c78519	upward
c78520	and the spirit of the animal
c78521	descends
c78522	into the earth?
c78523	I have seen
c78524	that there is nothing better
c78525	for a man than to enjoy his work,
c78526	because that is his lot.
c78527	For who can bring
c78528	him to see what
c78529	will come after him?
c78530	Again, I
c78531	observed all
c78532	taking place under the sun.
c78533	[I] saw
c78534	the tears of the oppressed,
c78535	and they had no comforter;
c78536	the oppression ... the power [lay] in the hands [of their oppressors],
c78537	and there was no comforter.
c78538	So I admired the dead,
c78539	who had already died,
c78540	above the living,
c78541	who are still alive.
c78542	But better than both
c78543	is he who has not yet existed,
c78544	who has not seen the evil
c78545	that is done under the sun.
c78546	I saw that all labor and success
c78547	spring from a man’s envy of his neighbor.
c78548	This too is futile
c78549	and a pursuit of the wind.
c78550	The fool folds his hands
c78551	and consumes his own flesh.
c78552	Better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and pursuit of the wind.
c78553	Again, I
c78554	saw futility under the sun.
c78555	There is a
c78556	man all alone,
c78557	without even a son or brother.
c78558	And though there is no end to his labor,
c78559	his eyes are still not content with his wealth:
c78560	“For whom do I toil
c78561	and bereave my soul of enjoyment?”
c78562	This too is futile—
c78563	a miserable task.
c78564	Two are better than one,
c78565	because they have a good return for their labor.
c78566	For
c78567	if ... falls down,
c78568	one ... his companion can lift him up;
c78569	but pity the one
c78570	who falls
c78571	without another
c78572	to help him up!
c78573	Again, if two lie down together,
c78574	they will keep warm;
c78575	can one
c78576	but how ... keep warm {alone}?
c78577	And though one may be overpowered,
c78578	two can resist.
c78579	Moreover, a cord of three strands is not quickly broken.
c78580	Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king
c78581	who no ... knows
c78582	longer ... how to take a warning.
c78583	For [the youth] came from prison
c78584	to be king,
c78585	even though he was born poor in his kingdom.
c78586	I saw that all who lived
c78587	and walked under the sun
c78588	followed this second child,
c78589	who succeeded [the king].
c78590	There is no limit to all the people
c78592	who were before them,
c78593	yet those who come later will not rejoice in [the successor].
c78594	This too is futile
c78595	and a pursuit of the wind.
c78596	Guard your steps
c78597	when you go to the house of God.
c78598	Draw near
c78599	to listen
c78600	rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools,
c78601	who do not know that
c78602	they do wrong.
c78603	Do not be hasty to speak,
c78604	and do not let your heart be hasty
c78605	to utter a word before God.
c78606	After all, God is in heaven
c78607	and you are on earth.
c78608	So let your words be few.
c78609	As a dream comes through many cares,
c78610	so the speech of a fool [comes] with many words.
c78611	When you make a vow to God,
c78612	do not delay
c78613	in fulfilling it,
c78614	because He takes no pleasure in fools.
c78615	your vow.
c78616	Fulfill
c78617	It is better
c78618	not to vow
c78619	than to make a vow
c78620	and not fulfill it.
c78621	Do not let your mouth
c78622	cause your body to sin,
c78623	and do not tell the messenger
c78624	that [your vow] was a mistake.
c78625	Why should God be angry with your words
c78626	and destroy the work of your hands?
c78627	For as many dreams bring futility,
c78628	so do many words.
c78629	Therefore, fear God.
c78630	If you see the oppression of the poor and the denial of justice and righteousness in the province,
c78631	do not be astonished at the matter;
c78632	for one official is watched by a superior,
c78633	and higher still are over them.
c78634	The produce of the earth is taken by all;
c78636	the king himself profits from the fields.
c78637	He who loves money
c78638	is never satisfied by money,
c78640	and he who loves wealth
c78641	is never satisfied by income.
c78642	This too is futile.
c78643	When good things increase,
c78644	so do those who consume them;
c78645	what then is the profit to the owner,
c78646	except to behold them with his eyes?
c78647	The sleep of the worker is sweet,
c78648	whether ... little
c78649	he eats ... or much,
c78650	but the abundance of the rich man
c78651	permits him no
c78652	sleep.
c78653	There is a grievous evil
c78654	I have seen under the sun:
c78655	wealth
c78656	hoarded to the harm of its owner,
c78657	or wealth lost in a bad venture,
c78658	so that when he has a son
c78659	there is nothing to pass on.
c78660	As [a man] came from his mother’s womb,
c78661	again: naked
c78662	so he will depart
c78663	as he arrived.
c78664	He takes nothing for his labor
c78665	to carry in his hands.
c78666	This too is a grievous evil:
c78667	Exactly as
c78668	a man is born,
c78669	so he will depart.
c78670	What does he gain
c78671	as he toils for the wind?
c78672	Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness,
c78673	with much sorrow,
c78674	sickness, and anger.
c78675	Here
c78676	is what I have seen to be good
c78677	and fitting:
c78678	to eat
c78679	and drink,
c78680	and to find satisfaction in all the labor
c78681	one does under the sun during the few days of life
c78682	that God has given him—
c78683	for this is his lot.
c78684	Furthermore, ... every man,
c78685	God has given riches and wealth to
c78686	and He has enabled
c78687	him to enjoy them,
c78688	to accept his lot,
c78689	and to rejoice in his labor.
c78690	This
c78691	is a gift from God.
c78692	For [a man] seldom considers the days of his life,
c78693	because God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.
c78694	There is another evil
c78695	I have seen under the sun,
c78696	and it weighs heavily upon mankind:
c78697	a man
c78698	God gives ... riches, wealth, and honor,
c78699	so that he lacks nothing his heart
c78700	desires;
c78701	but God does not allow
c78702	him to enjoy them
c78703	.Instead, a stranger will enjoy them.
c78704	This is futile
c78705	and a grievous evil.
c78706	A man may father a hundred [children]
c78707	and live for many years;
c78708	yet no matter how long
c78709	he lives,
c78710	if he is unsatisfied with his prosperity
c78711	and does not even receive a proper burial,
c78712	I say
c78713	that a stillborn child is better off than he.
c78714	For he enters in futility
c78715	and departs in darkness,
c78716	and his name is shrouded in obscurity.
c78717	though never seeing the sun
c78718	or knowing anything—
c78719	[A stillborn child] has more rest than he—
c78720	if he lives a thousand years twice over,
c78721	but fails to enjoy his prosperity.
c78722	Do not all go to the same place?
c78723	All a man’s labor [is] for his mouth,
c78724	yet his appetite is never satisfied.
c78725	What advantage, then, has the wise man over the fool?
c78726	What [gain comes] to the poor man
c78727	who knows
c78728	how to conduct himself before others?
c78729	Better what the eye can see
c78730	than the wandering of desire.
c78731	This too is futile
c78732	and a pursuit of the wind.
c78733	Whatever
c78734	exists
c78735	was named long ago,
c78736	is foreknown;
c78737	and what [happens] to a man ... but he
c78738	cannot
c78739	contend
c78740	with one stronger than he.
c78741	For the more words,
c78742	the more futility—
c78743	and how does that profit anyone?
c78744	For who knows
c78745	what is good for a man during the few days ... his fleeting life
c78746	he passes through ... like a shadow?
c78747	Who can tell a man
c78748	what will come after him under the sun?
c78749	A good name is better than fine perfume,
c78750	and one’s day of death [is better] than his day
c78751	of birth.
c78752	It is better
c78753	to enter a house of mourning
c78754	than a house of feasting,
c78755	since [death] [is] the end of every man,
c78756	and the living should take [this] to heart.
c78757	Sorrow is better than laughter,
c78758	for a sad countenance is good for the heart.
c78759	The heart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning,
c78760	but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
c78761	It is better
c78762	to heed a wise man’s rebuke
c78763	than
c78764	to listen to the song of fools.
c78765	For like the crackling of thorns under the pot,
c78766	so is the laughter of the fool—
c78767	this too is futile.
c78768	Surely extortion turns a wise man into a fool,
c78769	and a bribe corrupts the heart.
c78770	The end of a matter is better than the beginning,
c78771	[and] a patient spirit is better than a proud [one].
c78772	Do not be quickly ... in your spirit,
c78773	provoked
c78774	for anger settles in the lap of a fool.
c78775	Do not say,
c78776	“Why were
c78777	the old days better than these?”
c78778	For it is unwise of you to ask about this.
c78779	Wisdom, like an inheritance, [is] good,
c78780	and it benefits those who see the sun.
c78781	For wisdom,
c78782	like money, [is] a shelter,
c78783	and the advantage of knowledge
c78784	is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner.
c78785	Consider the work of God:
c78786	Who can
c78787	straighten
c78788	what He has bent?
c78789	In the day of prosperity be joyful,
c78790	but in the day of adversity, consider this:
c78791	God has made one [of these] along with the other, so that
c78792	a man cannot discover anything that will come after him.
c78793	In my futile life I have seen both of these:
c78794	A righteous man
c78795	perishing in his righteousness,
c78796	[and] a wicked man
c78797	living long in his wickedness.
c78798	Do not be overly righteous,
c78799	and do not make yourself too wise.
c78800	Why should you destroy yourself?
c78801	Do not be excessively wicked,
c78802	and do not be a fool.
c78803	Why should you die before your time?
c78804	It is good
c78805	to grasp the one
c78806	and not let the other slip from your hand.
c78807	For he who fears God will follow both [warnings].
c78808	Wisdom makes the wise man stronger than ten rulers
c78809	in a city.
c78810	Surely there is no righteous man on earth
c78811	who does good
c78812	and never sins.
c78813	to every word
c78814	that is spoken, or
c78815	Do not pay attention
c78816	you may hear your servant
c78817	cursing you.
c78818	For you know in your heart ... many times
c78819	that ... you yourself have cursed others.
c78820	All this I tested by wisdom, [saying],
c78821	“I resolve
c78822	to be wise.”
c78823	But it was beyond me.
c78824	is out of reach
c78825	What
c78826	exists
c78827	and very deep.
c78828	Who can fathom it?
c78829	I directed my mind
c78830	to understand,
c78831	to explore,
c78832	to search out wisdom and explanations,
c78833	and to understand
c78834	the stupidity of wickedness
c78835	and the folly of madness.
c78836	And I find
c78837	more bitter than death
c78838	the woman
c78839	who
c78840	[is] a snare, whose heart [is] a net,
c78841	and whose hands [are] chains.
c78842	The man who pleases God will escape her,
c78843	but the sinner will be ensnared.
c78844	“Behold,”
c78845	“I have discovered this
c78846	says the Teacher,
c78847	by adding one thing to another
c78848	to find an explanation.
c78849	While my soul was still searching
c78850	but not finding,
c78851	among a thousand I have found one [upright] man,
c78852	but among all these I have not found a [virtuous] woman.
c78853	Only ... have I found:
c78854	this ... I have discovered
c78855	that God made men upright,
c78856	but they have sought out many schemes.”
c78857	Who is like the wise man?
c78858	Who knows the interpretation of a matter?
c78859	A man’s wisdom brightens his face,
c78860	and the sternness of his face is changed.
c78861	I say,
c78862	Keep the king’s command,
c78863	because of your oath before God.
c78864	Do not hasten
c78865	to leave his presence,
c78866	and do not persist in a bad cause,
c78867	for ... whatever
c78868	he wants.
c78869	he will do
c78870	For the king’s word is supreme,
c78871	and who can say to him,
c78872	“What are you doing?”
c78873	Whoever keeps his command will come to no harm,
c78874	and a wise heart knows the right time and procedure.
c78875	For there is a right time and procedure to every purpose,
c78876	though a man’s misery weighs heavily upon him.
c78877	Since no one knows
c78878	what
c78879	will happen,
c78881	what is to come?
c78882	who can tell him
c78883	As no man
c78884	has power over the wind
c78885	to contain [it],
c78886	so there is no authority over the day of death.
c78887	As no one can be discharged in wartime,
c78888	so wickedness will not release those who practice it.
c78889	All this I have seen,
c78890	applying my mind to every deed
c78891	that is done under the sun;
c78892	[there is] a time
c78893	when one man lords it over another
c78894	to his own detriment.
c78895	Then too, I saw
c78896	the burial of the wicked
c78897	who had come
c78898	and gone from the holy place
c78899	and were praised in the city
c78900	where they had done so.
c78901	This too is futile.
c78902	When the sentence for a crime is not speedily executed,
c78903	the hearts of men become fully set
c78904	on doing evil.
c78905	Although a sinner does evil a hundred [times]
c78906	and still lives long,
c78907	yet I also know
c78908	that it will go well ... God, who are reverent
c78909	with those who fear ... in His presence.
c78910	it will not go well with [them],
c78911	and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.
c78912	Yet because [the wicked] do not fear God,
c78913	There is a futility
c78914	that is done on the earth:
c78915	There are righteous [men] who
c78916	get what the actions of the wicked [deserve],
c78917	and there are wicked [men]
c78918	who get what the actions of the righteous deserve.
c78919	I say
c78920	that this too is futile.
c78921	So I commended the enjoyment of life,
c78922	because there is nothing better for a man under the sun
c78923	than to eat
c78924	and drink
c78925	and be merry.
c78926	For this [joy] will accompany him in his labor during the days of his life
c78927	that God gives him under the sun.
c78928	When I applied my mind
c78929	to know wisdom
c78930	and to observe the activity
c78931	that one does on the earth—
c78932	though his eyes do not see sleep day or night—
c78933	I saw every work of God,
c78934	and that a man is unable
c78935	to comprehend the work
c78936	that is done under the sun.
c78937	Despite [his] efforts
c78938	to search it out,
c78939	he cannot find [its meaning];
c78940	even if the wise man claims
c78941	to know,
c78942	he is unable
c78943	to comprehend.
c78944	So I took all this to heart
c78945	and concluded
c78946	that the righteous and the wise, as well as their deeds, are in God’s hands.
c78947	whether love or hate.
c78948	Man does not know what lies ahead,
c78950	It is the same for all:
c78951	There is a common fate for the righteous and the wicked,
c78952	for the good [and the bad], for the clean and the unclean,
c78953	for the one who sacrifices
c78954	and the one who does not.
c78955	As it is for the good,
c78956	so it is for the sinner;
c78957	as it is for the one who makes a vow,
c78958	so [it is] for the one who refuses to take a vow.
c78959	This is an evil in everything
c78960	that is done under the sun:
c78961	There is one fate for everyone.
c78962	Furthermore, the hearts of men are full of evil
c78963	and madness while they are alive,
c78964	and afterward they [join] the dead.
c78965	however, for anyone who
c78966	is among the living;
c78967	There is hope,
c78968	for even a live dog
c78969	is better than a dead lion.
c78970	For the living know
c78971	that they will die,
c78972	but the dead
c78973	know nothing.
c78974	They have no further reward,
c78975	because the memory of them is forgotten.
c78976	Their love, their hate, and their envy have already vanished,
c78977	and they will never again have a portion in all
c78978	that is done under the sun.
c78979	Go,
c78980	eat your bread with joy,
c78981	and drink your wine with a cheerful heart,
c78982	for God has already approved your works:
c78983	“Let your clothes always be white,
c78984	and never spare the oil for your head.”
c78985	Enjoy life with ... wife
c78986	your beloved ... which
c78987	all the days of the fleeting life
c78988	has been given to you under the sun—
c78989	all your fleeting days.
c78990	For this is your portion in life and in your labor
c78991	under the sun.
c78992	Whatever
c78993	you find ... with your hands,
c78994	to do ... with all your might,
c78995	do [it]
c78996	for in Sheol, ... there is no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom.
c78997	where you are going,
c78998	something else
c78999	I saw ... under the sun:
c79000	The race is not to the swift,
c79001	nor the battle to the strong;
c79002	neither [is] the bread to the wise,
c79003	nor the wealth to the intelligent,
c79004	nor the favor to the skillful;
c79005	rather, time and chance happen to all.
c79006	For surely no man knows his time:
c79007	Like fish
c79008	caught in a cruel net
c79009	or birds
c79010	trapped in a snare,
c79011	so men are ensnared in an evil time
c79012	that suddenly falls upon them.
c79013	I have also seen this wisdom under the sun,
c79014	and it [was] great to me:
c79015	There was a small city
c79016	with few men.
c79017	A mighty king came against it,
c79018	surrounded it,
c79019	and built large siege ramps against it.
c79020	Now a poor wise man was found in [the city],
c79021	and he saved the city by his wisdom.
c79022	Yet no one remembered that poor man.
c79023	And I said,
c79024	“Wisdom is better than strength,
c79025	but the wisdom of the poor man is despised,
c79026	and his words
c79027	are not heeded.”
c79028	words of the wise
c79029	The calm ... are heeded
c79030	over the shouts of a ruler among fools.
c79031	Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
c79032	but one sinner destroys much good.
c79033	As dead flies ... a stench
c79034	bring ... to the perfumer’s oil,
c79035	so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
c79036	A wise man’s heart inclines to the right,
c79037	but the heart of a fool to the left.
c79038	Even ... along the road,
c79039	as the fool walks
c79040	his sense is lacking,
c79041	and he shows everyone
c79042	that he is a fool.
c79043	If the ruler’s temper flares against you,
c79044	do not abandon your post,
c79045	for calmness {lays} great offenses to rest.
c79046	There is an evil
c79047	I have seen under the sun—
c79048	an error
c79049	that proceeds from the ruler:
c79050	Folly is appointed to great heights,
c79051	but the rich sit in lowly positions.
c79052	I have seen slaves on horseback,
c79053	while princes
c79054	go on foot like slaves.
c79055	He who digs a pit
c79056	may fall into it,
c79057	and he who breaches a wall
c79058	may be bitten by a snake.
c79059	The one who quarries stones
c79060	may be injured by them,
c79061	and he who splits logs
c79062	endangers himself.
c79063	If the ax is dull
c79064	and the blade unsharpened,
c79065	more strength must be exerted,
c79066	but skill will produce success.
c79067	If the snake bites before it is charmed,
c79068	there is no profit for the charmer.
c79069	The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious,
c79070	but the lips of a fool consume him.
c79071	The beginning of his talk is folly,
c79072	and the end of his speech is evil madness.
c79073	Yet the fool multiplies words.
c79074	No one knows
c79075	what
c79076	is coming,
c79077	what will come after him?
c79078	and who can tell him
c79079	The toil of a fool wearies him,
c79080	for he does not know
c79081	the way to the city.
c79082	Woe to you,
c79083	O land
c79084	whose king is a youth,
c79085	and whose princes feast in the morning.
c79086	Blessed are you,
c79087	O land
c79088	whose king is a son of nobles,
c79089	and whose princes feast at the proper time— [to be] strong
c79090	rather than to become drunk.
c79091	Through laziness the roof caves in,
c79092	and in the hands of the idle, the house leaks.
c79093	A feast is prepared for laughter,
c79094	and wine makes life merry,
c79095	but money is the answer for everything.
c79096	Do not curse the king even in your thoughts,
c79097	[or] curse the rich even in your bedroom,
c79098	for a bird of the sky may carry your words,
c79099	and a winged creature may report your speech.
c79100	Cast your bread upon the waters,
c79101	for after many days you will find it [again].
c79102	Divide your portion among seven,
c79103	or even eight,
c79104	for you do not know
c79105	what disaster may befall the land.
c79106	If the clouds are full,
c79107	they will pour out rain upon the earth;
c79108	whether a tree falls to the south
c79109	or the north,
c79110	in the place
c79111	where [it] falls,
c79112	there it will lie.
c79113	He who watches the wind will fail to sow,
c79115	and he who observes the clouds
c79116	will fail to reap.
c79117	As you do not know
c79118	the path of the wind,
c79119	or how the bones [are formed] in a mother’s womb,
c79120	so you cannot understand the work of God,
c79121	the Maker of all things.
c79122	Sow your seed in the morning,
c79123	and do not rest your hands in the evening,
c79124	for you do not know
c79125	which will succeed,
c79126	whether this
c79127	or that,
c79128	or if both will equally prosper.
c79129	Light is sweet,
c79130	and it pleases the eyes
c79131	to see the sun.
c79132	So
c79133	if a man lives many years,
c79134	let him rejoice in them all;
c79135	but let him remember the days of darkness,
c79136	for they will be many.
c79137	Everything
c79138	to come
c79139	is futile.
c79140	Rejoice,
c79141	O young man,
c79142	while you are young,
c79143	and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth.
c79144	Walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes,
c79145	but know
c79146	that for all these [things] God will bring you to judgment.
c79147	So banish sorrow from your heart,
c79148	and cast off pain from your body,
c79149	for youth and vigor are fleeting.
c79150	Remember your Creator in the days of your youth,
c79151	before the days of adversity come,
c79152	and the years approach
c79153	of which you will say,
c79154	“I find no pleasure in them,”
c79155	before the sunlight, moon, and stars are darkened,
c79156	and the clouds return after the rain,
c79157	on the day
c79158	the keepers of the house tremble,
c79159	and the strong men stoop,
c79160	when those grinding cease
c79161	because they are few,
c79162	see dimly,
c79163	and those watching through windows
c79164	when the doors to the street are shut
c79165	and the sound of the mill fades away,
c79166	when one rises at the sound of a bird,
c79167	and all the daughters of song grow faint,
c79168	[when] [men] fear the heights
c79169	and dangers of the road,
c79170	when the almond tree blossoms,
c79171	the grasshopper loses its spring,
c79172	and the caper berry shrivels—
c79173	for then man goes to his eternal home,
c79174	and mourners walk the streets.
c79175	[Remember Him] before the silver cord is snapped,
c79176	and the golden bowl is crushed,
c79177	[before] the pitcher is shattered at the spring,
c79178	and the wheel is broken at the well,
c79179	[before] the dust returns to the ground
c79180	from which it came,
c79181	and the spirit returns to God
c79182	who gave it.
c79183	“Futility of futilities,”
c79184	says the Teacher.
c79185	“Everything is futile!”
c79186	Not only was the Teacher wise,
c79187	but he also taught the people knowledge;
c79188	he pondered,
c79189	searched out,
c79190	and arranged many proverbs.
c79191	The Teacher searched
c79192	to find delightful sayings
c79193	and to record accurate words of truth.
c79194	The words of the wise are like goads,
c79195	and the anthologies of the masters are like firmly embedded nails
c79196	driven by a single Shepherd.
c79198	But beyond these,
c79199	my son,
c79200	be warned:
c79201	to the making of many books,
c79202	There is no end
c79203	and much study wearies the body.
c79204	the conclusion of the matter [is this]:
c79205	When all has been heard,
c79206	Fear God
c79207	and keep His commandments,
c79208	because this is the whole [duty] of man.
c79209	For God will bring every deed into judgment,
c79210	along with every hidden thing,
c79211	whether good
c79212	or evil.
c79213	How lonely lies the city,
c79214	once so full of people!
c79215	She who was great among the nations has become like a widow.
c79216	The princess of the provinces has become a slave.
c79217	She weeps aloud in the night,
c79218	with tears upon her cheeks.
c79219	Among all her lovers there is no one to comfort [her].
c79220	All her friends have betrayed her;
c79221	they have become her enemies.
c79222	Judah has gone into exile under affliction and harsh slavery;
c79223	she dwells among the nations
c79224	but finds no place to rest.
c79225	All her pursuers have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.
c79226	The roads to Zion mourn, because no one comes to her appointed feasts.
c79227	All her gates are deserted;
c79228	her priests groan,
c79229	her maidens grieve,
c79230	and she herself
c79231	is bitter with anguish.
c79232	Her foes have become her masters;
c79233	her enemies are at ease.
c79234	For the LORD has brought her grief because of her many transgressions.
c79235	Her children have gone away as captives before the enemy.
c79236	All the splendor has departed from the Daughter of Zion.
c79237	Her princes are like deer
c79238	that find no pasture;
c79239	they lack the strength to flee in the face of the hunter.
c79240	In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures
c79241	that were hers in days of old.
c79242	When her people fell into the hand of the adversary,
c79243	she had no one to help.
c79244	Her enemies looked at her,
c79245	laughing at her downfall.
c79246	Jerusalem has sinned greatly;
c79247	therefore she has become an object of scorn.
c79248	All who honored her now despise her,
c79249	for they have seen her nakedness;
c79250	she herself groans
c79251	and turns away.
c79252	Her uncleanness stains her skirts;
c79253	she did not consider her end.
c79254	Her downfall was astounding;
c79255	there was no one to comfort her.
c79256	Look,
c79257	O LORD,
c79258	on my affliction,
c79259	for the enemy has triumphed!
c79260	The adversary has seized all her treasures.
c79261	For she has seen
c79262	the nations enter her sanctuary—
c79263	those You had forbidden
c79264	to enter Your assembly.
c79265	All her people groan
c79266	as they search for bread.
c79267	They have traded their treasures for food
c79268	to keep themselves alive.
c79269	Look,
c79270	O LORD,
c79271	and consider,
c79272	for I have become despised.
c79273	Is this nothing to you,
c79274	all you who pass by?
c79275	Look around
c79276	and see!
c79277	Is there any sorrow like mine,
c79278	which was inflicted on me,
c79279	which the LORD made me suffer on the day of His fierce anger?
c79280	He sent fire from on high; ... into my bones;
c79281	He made it seep
c79282	He spread a net for my feet
c79283	and turned me back.
c79284	He made me desolate,
c79285	faint all the day long.
c79286	My transgressions are bound into a yoke, ... by His hand;
c79287	knit together
c79288	they have come upon my neck,
c79289	has broken my strength.
c79290	and the Lord ... He has handed me over
c79291	to those I cannot
c79292	withstand.
c79293	The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst;
c79294	He has summoned an army against me
c79295	to crush my young warriors.
c79296	Like grapes in a winepress the Lord has trampled the Virgin Daughter of Judah.
c79297	For these things I weep;
c79298	my eyes flow with tears.
c79299	For there is no one nearby to comfort me,
c79300	no one to revive my soul.
c79301	My children are destitute
c79302	because the enemy has prevailed.
c79303	Zion stretches out her hands,
c79304	but there is no one to comfort her.
c79305	The LORD has decreed against Jacob that his neighbors become his foes.
c79306	Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
c79307	The LORD is righteous,
c79308	for I have rebelled against His command.
c79309	Listen,
c79310	all you people;
c79311	look upon my suffering.
c79312	My young men and maidens have gone into captivity.
c79313	I called out to my lovers,
c79314	but they have betrayed me.
c79315	My priests and elders perished in the city
c79316	while they searched for food
c79317	to keep themselves alive.
c79318	Behold,
c79319	O LORD,
c79320	how distressed I am.
c79321	I am churning within;
c79322	my heart is overturned,
c79323	for I have been most rebellious.
c79324	Outside, the sword bereaves;
c79325	inside, there is death.
c79326	People have heard
c79327	my groaning, ... that
c79328	but there is no one to comfort me.
c79329	All my enemies have heard of my trouble;
c79330	they are glad
c79331	You have caused it.
c79332	May You bring the day
c79333	You have announced,
c79334	so that they may become like me.
c79335	Let all their wickedness come before You,
c79336	and deal with them
c79337	as You have dealt with me because of all my transgressions.
c79338	For my groans are many,
c79339	and my heart is faint.
c79340	How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with His cloud of anger!
c79341	He has cast the glory of Israel from heaven to earth.
c79342	He has abandoned His footstool in the day of His anger.
c79343	the Lord has swallowed up
c79344	Without pity
c79345	all the dwellings of Jacob.
c79346	In His wrath He has demolished the fortified cities of the Daughter of Judah.
c79347	He brought to the ground
c79348	and defiled her kingdom and its princes.
c79349	He has cut off every horn of Israel in [His] fierce anger
c79350	and withdrawn His right hand at the approach of the enemy.
c79351	He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire
c79352	that consumes all around it.
c79353	He has bent His bow like an enemy;
c79354	His right hand is positioned. Like a foe
c79355	He has killed all who were pleasing to the eye;
c79356	He has poured out His wrath like fire on the tent of the Daughter of Zion.
c79357	The Lord is like an enemy;
c79358	He has swallowed up Israel.
c79359	He swallowed up all her palaces
c79360	and destroyed her strongholds.
c79361	He has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the Daughter of Judah.
c79362	He has laid waste to His tabernacle like a garden booth;
c79363	He has destroyed His place of meeting.
c79364	The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and Sabbaths.
c79365	In His fierce anger He has despised [both] king and priest.
c79366	The Lord has rejected His altar;
c79367	He has abandoned His sanctuary;
c79368	He has handed the walls of her palaces over to the enemy.
c79369	They have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed feast.
c79370	The LORD determined
c79371	to destroy the wall of the Daughter of Zion.
c79372	He stretched out a measuring line
c79373	and did not withdraw His hand
c79374	from destroying.
c79375	He made the ramparts and walls lament;
c79376	together they waste away.
c79377	Her gates have sunk into the ground;
c79378	He has destroyed
c79379	and shattered their bars.
c79380	Her king and her princes are [exiled] among the nations,
c79381	the law is no more,
c79382	and even her prophets find no vision from the LORD.
c79383	sit on the ground
c79384	The elders of the Daughter of Zion ... in silence.
c79385	They have thrown dust on their heads
c79386	and put on sackcloth.
c79387	The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
c79388	My eyes fail from weeping;
c79389	I am churning within.
c79390	My heart is poured out in grief over the destruction of the daughter of my people,
c79391	because children and infants faint in the streets of the city.
c79392	They cry out to their mothers:
c79393	“Where is the grain and wine?”
c79394	as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city,
c79395	as their lives fade away in the arms of their mothers.
c79396	What can I say for you?
c79397	To what can I compare you,
c79398	O daughter of Jerusalem?
c79399	To what can I liken you,
c79400	that I may console you,
c79401	O virgin Daughter of Zion?
c79402	For your wound is as deep as the sea.
c79403	Who can ever heal you?
c79404	The visions of your prophets were empty and deceptive;
c79405	they did not expose your guilt
c79406	to ward off your captivity.
c79407	The oracles they saw for you were empty and misleading.
c79408	All who pass by clap their hands at you [in scorn].
c79409	They hiss
c79410	and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem:
c79411	“Is this the city
c79412	that was called
c79413	the perfection of beauty,
c79414	the joy of the whole earth?”
c79415	All your enemies open their mouths against you.
c79416	They hiss
c79417	and gnash their teeth,
c79418	saying,
c79419	“We have swallowed her up.
c79420	This is the day
c79421	for which we have waited.
c79422	We have lived
c79423	to see it!”
c79424	The LORD has done
c79425	what He planned;
c79426	He has accomplished His decree,
c79427	which He ordained in days of old.
c79428	He has overthrown you
c79429	without pity;
c79430	He has let the enemy gloat over you
c79431	and exalted the horn of your foes.
c79432	The hearts [of the people] cry out to the Lord.
c79433	O wall of the Daughter of Zion,
c79434	let your tears run down like a river day and night.
c79435	Give yourself no relief,
c79436	and your eyes no rest.
c79437	Arise,
c79438	cry out in the night from the first watch of the night.
c79439	Pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord.
c79440	Lift up your hands to Him for the lives of your children
c79441	who are fainting from hunger on the corner of every street.
c79442	Look,
c79443	O LORD,
c79444	and consider:
c79445	Whom have You [ever] treated like this?
c79446	Should women eat their offspring, the infants they have nurtured?
c79447	Should priests and prophets be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
c79448	Both young and old lie together in the dust of the streets.
c79449	My young men and maidens have fallen by the sword.
c79450	You have slain [them] in the day of Your anger;
c79451	You have slaughtered [them]
c79452	without compassion.
c79453	You summoned my attackers on every side, as for an appointed feast day.
c79454	In the Day of the LORD’s anger no one escaped or survived.
c79455	those I nurtured
c79456	and reared.
c79457	My enemy has destroyed
c79458	I am the man
c79459	who has seen affliction under the rod of [God’s] wrath.
c79460	He has driven me away
c79461	and made me walk in darkness instead of light.
c79462	Indeed, He keeps turning
c79463	His hand [against me] all day long.
c79464	He has worn away my flesh and skin;
c79465	He has shattered my bones.
c79466	He has besieged me
c79467	and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
c79468	He has made me dwell in darkness like those dead for ages.
c79469	He has walled me in
c79470	so I cannot escape;
c79471	He has weighed me down with chains.
c79472	Even when I cry out
c79473	and plead for help,
c79474	He shuts out my prayer.
c79475	He has barred my ways with cut stones;
c79476	He has made my paths crooked.
c79477	He is a bear lying in wait,
c79478	a lion in hiding.
c79479	He forced me off my path
c79480	and tore me to pieces;
c79481	He left me without help.
c79482	He bent His bow
c79483	and set me as the target for His arrow.
c79484	He pierced my kidneys with His arrows.
c79485	I am a laughingstock to all my people;
c79486	they mock me in song all day long.
c79487	He has filled me with bitterness;
c79488	He has intoxicated me with wormwood.
c79489	He has ground my teeth with gravel
c79490	and trampled me in the dust.
c79491	My soul has been deprived of peace;
c79492	I have forgotten what prosperity is.
c79493	So I say,
c79494	“My strength has perished
c79495	along with my hope from the LORD.”
c79496	Remember my affliction and wandering, the wormwood and the gall.
c79497	Surely ... remembers
c79498	my soul ... and is humbled within me.
c79499	Yet I call this to mind,
c79500	and therefore I have hope:
c79501	the LORD’s loving devotion
c79502	Because of ... we are not consumed,
c79503	for His compassions never fail.
c79504	They are new every morning;
c79505	great is Your faithfulness!
c79506	“The LORD is my portion,”
c79507	says my soul,
c79508	“therefore I will hope in Him.”
c79509	The LORD is good to those who wait for Him,
c79510	to the soul
c79511	who seeks Him.
c79512	It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
c79513	It is good for a man
c79514	to bear the yoke while he is still young.
c79515	Let him sit alone
c79516	in silence,
c79517	for God has disciplined him.
c79518	Let him bury his face in the dust—
c79519	perhaps there is still hope.
c79520	Let him offer his cheek to the one who would strike him;
c79521	let him be filled with reproach.
c79522	For the Lord will not cast us off forever.
c79523	Even if He causes grief,
c79524	He will show compassion according to His abundant loving devotion.
c79525	For He does not willingly afflict
c79526	or grieve the sons of men.
c79527	To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the land,
c79528	to deny a man justice before the Most High,
c79529	to subvert a man in his lawsuit—
c79530	of these the Lord does not approve.
c79531	Who has spoken
c79532	and it came to pass,
c79533	unless the Lord has ordained it?
c79534	Do not both adversity and good come from the mouth of the Most High?
c79535	Why should any mortal man complain,
c79536	in view of [his] sins?
c79537	Let us examine ... our ways,
c79538	and test
c79539	and turn back to the LORD.
c79540	Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven:
c79541	“We have sinned
c79542	and rebelled;
c79543	You have not forgiven.”
c79544	You have covered Yourself in anger
c79545	and pursued us;
c79546	You have killed
c79547	without pity.
c79548	You have covered Yourself with a cloud
c79549	that no prayer can pass through.
c79550	You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.
c79551	All our enemies open their mouths against us.
c79552	Panic and pitfall have come upon us—
c79553	devastation and destruction.
c79554	Streams of tears flow from my eyes over the destruction of the daughter of my people.
c79555	My eyes overflow
c79556	unceasingly,
c79557	without relief,
c79558	until ... looks down
c79559	the LORD ... from heaven and sees.
c79560	My eyes bring grief to my soul because of all the daughters of my city.
c79561	Without cause my enemies hunted me like a bird.
c79562	They dropped me alive into a pit
c79563	and cast stones at me.
c79564	The waters flowed over my head,
c79565	and I thought
c79566	I was going to die.
c79567	I called on Your name,
c79568	O LORD,
c79569	out of the depths of the Pit.
c79570	You heard my plea:
c79571	“Do not ignore my cry for relief.”
c79572	You drew near when
c79573	I called on You;
c79574	You said,
c79575	“Do not be afraid.”
c79576	You defend
c79577	O Lord;
c79578	my cause,
c79579	You redeem my life.
c79580	You have seen,
c79581	O LORD,
c79582	the wrong done to me;
c79583	uphold my cause.
c79584	You see all their malice,
c79585	all their plots against me.
c79586	You have heard their insults,
c79587	O LORD,
c79588	all their plots against me—
c79589	the slander and murmuring of my opponents against me all day long.
c79590	When they sit and when they rise, see how
c79591	they mock me in song.
c79592	You will pay them back what they deserve,
c79593	O LORD,
c79594	according to the work of their hands.
c79595	You will give them hardness of heart;
c79596	may Your curse be upon them!
c79597	You will pursue them in anger
c79598	and exterminate them from under the heavens of the LORD.
c79599	How the gold has become tarnished,
c79600	the pure gold has become dull!
c79601	The gems of the temple lie scattered on every street corner.
c79602	the precious sons of Zion,
c79603	once worth their weight in pure gold,
c79604	How ... are now esteemed as clay jars, the work of a potter’s hands!
c79605	Even jackals offer their breasts
c79606	to nurse their young,
c79607	[but] the daughter of my people has become cruel, like an ostrich in the wilderness.
c79608	The nursing infant’s tongue clings in thirst to the roof of his mouth.
c79609	Little children beg for bread,
c79610	but no one gives them any.
c79611	Those who once ate delicacies
c79612	are destitute in the streets;
c79613	those brought up in purple
c79614	huddle in ash heaps.
c79615	The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than [that] of Sodom,
c79616	which was overthrown in an instant
c79617	without a hand turned toward her.
c79618	Her dignitaries were brighter than snow,
c79619	whiter than milk;
c79620	their bodies were more ruddy than rubies,
c79621	their appearance like sapphires.
c79622	But now their appearance is blacker than soot;
c79623	they are not recognized in the streets.
c79624	Their skin has shriveled on their bones;
c79625	it has become as dry as a stick.
c79626	Those slain by the sword are better off than those who die of hunger,
c79627	who waste away,
c79628	pierced with pain because the fields lack produce.
c79629	The hands of compassionate women have cooked their own children,
c79630	who became their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
c79631	The LORD has exhausted His wrath;
c79632	He has poured out His fierce anger;
c79633	He has kindled a fire in Zion,
c79634	and it has consumed her foundations.
c79635	The kings of the earth did not believe, nor any people of the world,
c79636	that an enemy or a foe could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
c79637	[But this was] for the sins of her prophets and the guilt of her priests,
c79638	who shed the blood of the righteous in her midst.
c79639	They wandered blind in the streets,
c79640	defiled by this blood,
c79641	so that no one dared
c79642	to touch their garments.
c79643	“Go away!
c79644	Unclean!”
c79645	men shouted at them.
c79646	“Away,
c79647	away!
c79648	Do not touch us!”
c79649	So they fled
c79650	and wandered.
c79651	Among the nations it was said,
c79652	here no longer.”
c79653	“They can stay
c79654	The LORD Himself has scattered them;
c79655	them no more.
c79656	He regards
c79657	The priests are shown no honor,
c79658	the elders find no favor.
c79659	All the while
c79660	our eyes were failing as we looked in vain for help.
c79661	We watched from our towers for a nation
c79662	[that] could not save us.
c79663	They stalked our every step,
c79664	so that we could not walk in our streets.
c79665	Our end drew near,
c79666	our time ran out,
c79667	for our end had come!
c79668	Those who chased us were swifter than the eagles in the sky;
c79669	they pursued us over the mountains
c79670	and ambushed us in the wilderness.
c79671	The LORD’s anointed, the breath of our life, was captured in their pits.
c79672	We had said of him,
c79673	“Under his shadow we will live among the nations.”
c79674	So rejoice
c79675	and be glad,
c79676	O daughter of Edom,
c79677	who dwells in the land of Uz.
c79678	Yet the cup will pass to you as well;
c79679	you will get drunk
c79680	and expose yourself.
c79681	your punishment is complete;
c79682	O Daughter of Zion,
c79683	He will not prolong
c79684	your exile.
c79685	But He will punish your iniquity,
c79686	O Daughter of Edom;
c79687	He will expose your sins.
c79688	Remember,
c79689	O LORD,
c79690	what has happened to us.
c79691	Look
c79692	and see our disgrace!
c79693	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
c79694	our houses to foreigners.
c79695	We have become ... orphans;
c79696	fatherless
c79697	our mothers are widows.
c79698	We must buy the water we drink;
c79699	our wood comes at a price.
c79700	We are closely pursued;
c79701	we are weary
c79702	[and find] no rest.
c79703	We submitted to Egypt
c79704	[and] Assyria,
c79705	to get enough food.
c79706	Our fathers sinned
c79707	[and are] no more,
c79708	but we bear their punishment.
c79709	Slaves rule over us;
c79710	[there is] no one to deliver us from their hands.
c79711	We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the wilderness.
c79712	Our skin is as hot as an oven because of the burning of famine.
c79713	Women have been ravished in Zion,
c79714	virgins in the cities of Judah.
c79715	Princes have been hung up by their hands;
c79716	elders receive no respect.
c79717	Young men toil at millstones;
c79718	boys stagger under loads of wood.
c79719	The elders have left the city gate;
c79720	the young men [have stopped] their music.
c79721	Joy has left our hearts;
c79722	our dancing has turned to mourning.
c79723	The crown has fallen from our head.
c79724	Woe to us,
c79725	for we have sinned!
c79726	Because of this, our hearts are faint;
c79727	because of these, our eyes grow dim:
c79728	because of Mount Zion,
c79729	which lies desolate,
c79730	haunted by the jackals.
c79731	You, O LORD, reign forever;
c79732	Your throne endures from generation to generation.
c79733	Why have You forgotten us forever?
c79734	Why have You forsaken us for so long?
c79735	Restore
c79736	O LORD,
c79737	us to Yourself,
c79738	so we may return;
c79739	renew our days as of old,
c79740	unless You have utterly rejected us
c79741	and remain angry with us beyond measure.
c79742	This is what happened in the days of Xerxes,
c79744	who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.
c79745	In those days
c79746	King Xerxes sat on his royal throne
c79747	in the citadel of Susa.
c79748	In the third year
c79749	of his reign,
c79750	[Xerxes] held a feast for all his officials and servants. The military leaders of Persia and Media [were there], along with the nobles and princes of the provinces.
c79751	And for a full 180 days, he displayed the glorious riches of his kingdom and the magnificent splendor of his greatness.
c79753	At the end of this time,
c79754	the king held ... for all the people
c79755	in the citadel of Susa,
c79756	in the garden courtyard of the royal palace, ... a seven-day feast ... from the least to the greatest.
c79757	[Hangings of] white and violet linen were fastened with cords of fine white and purple to silver rings on the marble pillars.
c79758	Gold and silver couches were arranged on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other precious stones.
c79759	Beverages were served in an array of goblets of gold,
c79760	each with a different design,
c79761	and the royal wine flowed freely, according to the king’s bounty.
c79762	By ... was placed on the drinking,
c79763	no limit
c79764	order of the king, ... and every wine steward
c79765	was to serve each man whatever he desired.
c79766	Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace
c79767	of King Xerxes.
c79768	On the seventh day,
c79769	when the king's heart was merry with wine,
c79770	he ordered the seven eunuchs ... Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas—
c79771	who served him—
c79772	to bring Queen Vashti before him, [wearing] her royal crown,
c79773	to display her beauty to the people and officials.
c79774	For she [was] beautiful to behold.
c79775	Queen Vashti, however, refused
c79776	to come at the king’s command
c79777	[brought] by [his] eunuchs.
c79778	And the king became furious,
c79779	and his anger burned within him.
c79780	Then the king consulted the wise men who knew the times,
c79781	for it was customary for him to confer with the experts in law and justice.
c79783	His closest advisors [were]
c79784	Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had personal access to the king
c79785	[and] ranked highest in the kingdom.
c79786	“According to law,” he asked, “what
c79787	should be done with Queen Vashti,
c79788	since she refused to obey the command of King Xerxes delivered by the eunuchs?”
c79789	And in the presence of the king and his princes, Memucan replied,
c79790	“Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king,
c79791	but all the princes and the peoples in all
c79792	the provinces of King Xerxes.
c79793	For the conduct of the queen will become known to all women,
c79794	causing them to despise their husbands
c79795	and say,
c79796	‘King Xerxes ordered
c79797	Queen Vashti to be brought before him,
c79798	but she did not come.’
c79799	This very day the noble women of Persia and Media ... will say
c79800	who have heard about the queen's conduct
c79801	the same thing to all the king’s officials,
c79802	resulting in much contempt and wrath.
c79803	So if it pleases the king,
c79804	let him issue a royal decree,
c79805	and let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media
c79806	so that it cannot be repealed,
c79807	that Vashti shall never again enter the presence of King Xerxes,
c79808	and her royal position shall be given to a woman
c79809	more worthy than she.
c79810	The edict the king ... will be heard
c79811	issues
c79812	throughout ... kingdom—
c79813	his vast ... and so
c79814	all women, from the least to the greatest, will honor their husbands.”
c79815	The king and his princes were pleased with this counsel;
c79816	so the king did as Memucan had advised.
c79817	He sent letters to all the provinces of the kingdom,
c79818	to each province in its own script
c79819	and to each people in their own language,
c79820	that every man should be
c79821	master of his own household.
c79822	proclaiming
c79823	Some time later,
c79824	when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided,
c79825	he recalled Vashti
c79826	and what she had done,
c79827	and what had been decreed against her.
c79828	Then the king's attendants proposed,
c79829	“Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king,
c79830	and let the king appoint commissioners in each province of his kingdom
c79831	to assemble all the beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women,
c79832	and give them the required beauty treatments.
c79833	Then let the young woman
c79834	who pleases the king
c79835	become queen in place of Vashti.”
c79836	This suggestion pleased the king,
c79837	and he acted accordingly.
c79838	[Now] there was at the citadel of Susa a Jewish man
c79839	named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish.
c79840	from the tribe of Benjamin
c79841	He had been carried into exile from Jerusalem ... among those taken captive
c79842	with Jeconiah king of Judah.
c79843	by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
c79844	And [Mordecai] had brought up Hadassah
c79845	(that is, Esther),
c79846	the daughter of his uncle,
c79847	because she did not have a father or mother.
c79848	The young woman was lovely in form and appearance,
c79849	and when her father and mother had died, Mordecai had taken her in as his own daughter.
c79850	When
c79851	the king’s command and edict had been proclaimed,
c79852	many young women gathered at the citadel of Susa under the care of Hegai.
c79853	Esther was also taken to the palace and placed under the care of Hegai, the custodian of the women.
c79854	And the young woman pleased him
c79855	and obtained his favor,
c79856	so he quickly ... with beauty treatments and the special diet.
c79857	provided her
c79858	seven select maidservants
c79859	He assigned to her ... from the palace
c79860	and transferred her with them to the best place in the harem.
c79861	Esther did not reveal her people or her lineage,
c79862	because Mordecai had instructed her
c79863	not to do so.
c79864	Every day Mordecai walked back and forth in front of the courtyard of the harem
c79865	to learn about Esther's welfare
c79866	and what was happening to her.
c79867	before [her] turn
c79868	to go to King Xerxes,
c79870	In the twelve months ... the harem regulation required
c79871	to receive beauty treatments
c79872	with oil of myrrh for six months,
c79873	[each young woman] ... and then with perfumes and cosmetics for another six months.
c79874	When the young woman would go to the king,
c79875	whatever
c79876	she requested
c79877	she was given
c79878	to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.
c79879	She would go [there] in the evening,
c79880	and in the morning she would return to a second harem under the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch in charge of the concubines.
c79881	She would not return to the king
c79882	unless he delighted in her
c79883	and summoned her by name.
c79885	Now Esther [was] the daughter of Abihail, the uncle from whom Mordecai ... And when it was her turn
c79886	had adopted her as his own daughter.
c79887	to go to the king,
c79888	she did not ask for anything
c79889	except
c79890	what Hegai, the king’s trusted official in charge of the harem, had advised.
c79891	And Esther found favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her.
c79892	She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal palace in the tenth month,
c79893	the month Tebeth,
c79894	in the seventh year of his reign.
c79895	And the king loved Esther more than all the [other] women,
c79896	and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all of the other virgins.
c79897	So he placed the royal crown upon her head
c79898	and made her queen in place of Vashti.
c79899	Then the king held a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his officials and servants.
c79900	He proclaimed a tax holiday in the provinces
c79901	and gave gifts worthy of the king’s bounty.
c79902	When the virgins were assembled a second [time],
c79903	Mordecai was sitting at the King’s Gate.
c79904	Esther still had not revealed her lineage or her people,
c79905	just as Mordecai had instructed.
c79906	She obeyed Mordecai’s command,
c79907	as she had done under his care.
c79908	In those days,
c79909	while Mordecai was sitting at the King’s Gate,
c79910	Bigthan and Teresh, two eunuchs who guarded the king’s entrance, grew angry
c79911	and conspired
c79912	to assassinate King Xerxes.
c79913	When Mordecai learned of the plot,
c79914	he reported it to Queen Esther,
c79915	and she informed the king on Mordecai’s behalf.
c79916	After the report had been investigated
c79917	and verified,
c79918	both [officials] were hanged on the gallows.
c79919	And all this was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king.
c79920	After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite,
c79921	elevating him
c79922	to a position above all the princes
c79923	who [were] with him.
c79924	All the royal servants
c79925	at the King’s Gate
c79926	bowed down
c79927	and paid homage to Haman,
c79928	because the king had commanded this for him.
c79929	But Mordecai would not bow down
c79930	or pay homage.
c79931	Then the royal servants ... asked
c79932	at the King’s Gate
c79933	Mordecai,
c79934	“Why do you disobey the command of the king?”
c79936	Day after day they warned him,
c79937	but he would not comply.
c79938	So they reported it to Haman
c79939	to see
c79940	whether Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated,
c79941	since he had told
c79942	them he was a Jew.
c79943	When Haman saw
c79944	that Mordecai would not bow down
c79945	or pay him homage,
c79946	he was filled with rage.
c79947	he despised the notion
c79948	of Mordecai’s ... of laying hands ... alone.
c79949	And when he learned the identity ... people, ... on Mordecai
c79950	Instead, he sought
c79951	to destroy all ... the Jews,
c79952	throughout the kingdom of Xerxes.
c79953	of Mordecai’s people,
c79954	in the first month,
c79955	the month of Nisan, ... (that is,
c79956	In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, ... the pur ... was cast
c79957	the lot)
c79958	before Haman to determine a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth
c79959	month, the month of Adar.
c79960	Then Haman informed King Xerxes,
c79961	“There
c79962	is a certain people scattered
c79963	and dispersed among the peoples of every province of your kingdom.
c79964	Their laws are different from everyone else’s,
c79965	and they do not obey the king’s laws;
c79966	it is not in the king’s best interest
c79967	to tolerate them.
c79968	If the king approves,
c79969	let [a decree] be issued
c79970	to destroy them,
c79971	ten thousand talents of silver ... to pay those who carry this out.”
c79972	and I will deposit ... into the royal treasury
c79973	So the king removed the signet ring from his finger
c79974	and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite,
c79975	the enemy of the Jews.
c79976	said the king to Haman.
c79977	“Keep your money,” ... [are] given to you
c79978	“These people
c79979	to do with them as you please.”
c79980	On the thirteenth day of the first month, the royal scribes were summoned
c79981	and the order was written exactly as
c79982	Haman commanded
c79983	the royal satraps, the governors
c79984	of each province,
c79985	and the officials of each people,
c79986	in the script of each province
c79987	and the language of every people.
c79988	It was written in the name of King Xerxes
c79989	and sealed with the royal signet ring.
c79990	And the letters were sent by couriers to each of the royal provinces
c79991	with the order to destroy,
c79992	kill,
c79993	and annihilate all the Jews— young and old, women and children— ... on a single day, the thirteenth ... the twelfth month.
c79994	day of Adar,
c79995	and to plunder their possessions
c79996	A copy of the text
c79997	of the edict was to be issued in every province
c79998	and published to all the people,
c79999	so that they would be ready for that day.
c80000	The couriers left,
c80001	spurred on by the king's command,
c80002	and the law was issued in the citadel of Susa.
c80003	Then the king and Haman sat down
c80004	to drink,
c80005	but the city of Susa was in confusion.
c80006	When Mordecai learned of all
c80007	that had happened,
c80008	he tore his clothes,
c80009	put on sackcloth and ashes,
c80010	and went out into the middle of the city,
c80011	wailing loudly and bitterly.
c80012	But he went only as far as the King’s Gate,
c80013	because the law prohibited
c80014	anyone wearing sackcloth from entering [that] gate.
c80015	In every province to which
c80016	the king’s command and edict came,
c80017	there was great mourning among the Jews.
c80018	They fasted, wept, and lamented,
c80019	and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
c80020	When Esther's maidens and eunuchs came
c80021	and told her [about Mordecai],
c80022	the queen was overcome with distress.
c80023	She sent clothes
c80024	for Mordecai to wear
c80025	instead of his sackcloth,
c80026	but he would not accept them.
c80027	Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs
c80028	appointed to her,
c80029	and she dispatched him to Mordecai
c80030	to learn
c80031	what was troubling him
c80032	and why.
c80033	So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square
c80034	in front of the King’s Gate,
c80035	and Mordecai told him all
c80036	that had happened to him,
c80037	including the exact amount of money
c80038	that Haman had promised
c80039	to pay into the royal treasury ... the Jews.
c80040	in order to destroy
c80041	a copy of the written decree
c80042	Mordecai also gave [Hathach] ... in Susa
c80043	for the destruction [of the Jews],
c80044	issued
c80045	to show ... to Esther,
c80046	and explain
c80047	urging her ... her
c80048	to approach the king,
c80049	implore his favor,
c80050	and plead before him for ... people.
c80051	So Hathach went back
c80052	and relayed Mordecai’s response to Esther.
c80053	Then Esther spoke to Hathach
c80054	and instructed him to tell Mordecai,
c80055	“All the royal officials and the people of the king's provinces know
c80056	that ... applies to every man or woman
c80057	who approaches the king in the inner courtyard
c80058	without being summoned—
c80059	one law
c80060	that he be put to death.
c80061	Only if
c80062	the king extends the gold scepter
c80063	may that person live.
c80064	But I have not been summoned
c80065	to appear before ... king
c80066	the ... for the past thirty days.”
c80067	When Esther's words were relayed to Mordecai,
c80068	he sent back
c80069	to [her] this reply:
c80070	“Do not imagine that because you are
c80071	in the king's palace you alone will escape the fate of all the Jews.
c80072	For
c80073	if you remain silent at this time,
c80074	relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place,
c80075	but you and your father’s house will perish.
c80076	And who knows
c80077	but that you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”
c80078	Then Esther ... this reply
c80079	sent ... to Mordecai:
c80080	“Go
c80081	and assemble all the Jews
c80082	who can be found in Susa,
c80083	and fast for me.
c80084	Do not eat
c80085	or drink day or night for three days,
c80086	and I and my maidens will fast as you do.
c80087	After that, I will go to the king,
c80088	even though it is against the law,
c80090	and if I perish,
c80091	I perish.”
c80092	So Mordecai went
c80093	and did all
c80094	that Esther had instructed him.
c80095	On the third day,
c80096	Esther put on [her] royal [attire]
c80097	and stood in the inner courtyard of the palace across from the king's quarters.
c80098	The king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal courtroom, facing the entrance.
c80100	As soon as the king saw Queen Esther
c80101	standing in the courtyard,
c80102	she found favor in his sight.
c80103	The king extended the gold scepter ... toward Esther,
c80104	in his hand
c80105	and she approached
c80106	and touched the tip of the scepter.
c80107	the king inquired.
c80108	“What is it,
c80109	Queen Esther?”
c80110	“What [is] your request?
c80111	Even up to half the kingdom,
c80112	it will be given to you.”
c80113	Esther replied,
c80114	“If it pleases the king,”
c80115	“may the king and Haman come today to the banquet
c80116	I have prepared for [the king].”
c80117	commanded the king,
c80118	“Hurry,” ... “and bring Haman,
c80119	so we can do as Esther has requested.”
c80120	So the king and Haman went to the banquet
c80121	that Esther had prepared.
c80122	And as they drank their wine, the king said to Esther,
c80123	“What is your petition?
c80124	It will be given to you.
c80125	What [is] your request?
c80126	Even up to half the kingdom,
c80127	it will be fulfilled.”
c80128	Esther replied,
c80130	“This is my petition and my request:
c80131	If I have found favor in the sight of the king,
c80132	and if it pleases the king
c80133	to grant my petition
c80134	and fulfill my request,
c80135	may the king and Haman come ... to the banquet
c80136	I will prepare for them.
c80137	tomorrow ... Then I will answer the king's question.”
c80138	That day Haman went out full of joy and glad of heart.
c80139	At the King’s Gate, however, [he] saw Mordecai,
c80140	who did not rise
c80141	or tremble in fear at his presence.
c80142	And Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai.
c80143	Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself
c80144	and went home.
c80145	And calling for
c80146	his friends and his wife Zeresh,
c80147	Haman recounted to them his glorious wealth, his many sons, and all the ways
c80148	the king had honored
c80149	and promoted him over the other officials and servants.
c80150	Haman added,
c80151	“What is more,” ... “Queen Esther invited no ... to join the king at the banquet
c80152	she prepared,
c80153	one but me
c80154	and I am invited back tomorrow along with the king.
c80155	Yet none of this
c80156	satisfies me as long
c80157	as I see Mordecai the Jew
c80158	sitting at the King’s Gate.”
c80159	His wife Zeresh and all his friends told him,
c80160	“Have them build a gallows fifty cubits high,
c80161	and ask the king in the morning
c80162	to have Mordecai hanged on it.
c80163	Then go to the banquet with the king and enjoy yourself.”
c80164	The advice pleased Haman,
c80165	and he had the gallows constructed.
c80166	That night, sleep escaped the king;
c80167	so he ordered
c80168	the book of records, the chronicles, to be brought in
c80169	and read to him.
c80170	And there it was found recorded
c80171	that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the eunuchs who guarded the king’s entrance,
c80172	when they had conspired
c80173	to assassinate King Xerxes.
c80174	The king inquired,
c80175	“What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this act?”
c80176	replied the king's attendants.
c80177	“Nothing has been done for him,”
c80178	the king asked.
c80179	“Who is in the court?”
c80180	Now Haman had [just] entered the outer court of the palace
c80181	to ask the king
c80182	to hang Mordecai on the gallows
c80183	he had prepared for him.
c80184	So the king’s attendants answered him,
c80185	“Haman is there, standing in the court.”
c80186	ordered the king.
c80187	“Bring him in,”
c80188	Haman entered,
c80189	and the king asked him,
c80190	“What
c80191	should be done for the man
c80192	the king wants to honor?”
c80193	Now Haman thought to himself,
c80194	“Who would the king be delighted
c80195	to honor
c80196	more than me?”
c80197	And Haman told the king,
c80198	“For the man
c80199	whom the king is delighted to honor,
c80200	have them bring a royal robe
c80201	that the king himself has worn,
c80202	and a horse
c80203	the king himself has ridden, with
c80204	a royal crest on its head.
c80205	Let the robe and the horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble princes.
c80206	Let them array the man
c80207	the king wants to honor
c80208	and parade him on the horse through the city square,
c80209	proclaiming before him,
c80210	‘This is what is done for the man
c80211	whom the king is delighted to honor!’”
c80212	said the king to Haman,
c80213	“Hurry,”
c80214	Take the robe and the horse
c80215	just as you proposed.
c80216	“and do ... to Mordecai the Jew,
c80217	who is sitting at the King’s Gate.
c80218	Do not neglect anything
c80219	that you have suggested.”
c80220	So Haman took the robe and the horse,
c80221	arrayed Mordecai,
c80222	and paraded him through the city square,
c80223	crying out before him,
c80224	“This is what is done for the man
c80225	whom the king is delighted to honor!”
c80226	Then Mordecai returned to the King’s Gate.
c80227	But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief.
c80228	Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything
c80229	that had happened.
c80230	His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him,
c80231	“Since Mordecai, ... is Jewish,
c80232	whom ... has begun,
c80233	before ... your downfall
c80234	you will not prevail against him—
c80235	for surely you will fall before him.”
c80236	While they were still speaking with [Haman],
c80237	the king's eunuchs arrived
c80238	and rushed
c80239	[him] to the banquet
c80240	that Esther had prepared.
c80241	So the king and Haman went
c80242	to dine with Esther the queen,
c80243	and as they drank their wine on the second day, the king asked once more,
c80244	what [is] your petition?
c80245	“Queen Esther,
c80246	It will be given to you.
c80247	What [is] your request?
c80248	Even up to half the kingdom,
c80249	it will be fulfilled.”
c80250	Then Queen Esther replied,
c80252	“If I have found favor in your sight,
c80253	O king,
c80254	and if it pleases the king,
c80255	grant me my life as my petition,
c80256	and [the lives of] my people as my request.
c80257	For my people and I have been sold out
c80258	to destruction,
c80259	death,
c80260	and annihilation.
c80262	If we had merely been sold as menservants and maidservants,
c80263	I would have held my peace,
c80264	because no such distress would justify burdening the king.”
c80265	Then King Xerxes spoke up
c80266	and asked Queen Esther,
c80267	“Who is this, ... is the one
c80268	and where
c80269	who would
c80270	devise such a scheme?”
c80271	Esther replied,
c80272	“The adversary and enemy
c80273	is this wicked man— Haman!”
c80274	And Haman stood in terror before the king and queen.
c80275	In his fury, the king arose from drinking his wine and went to the palace garden,
c80276	while Haman stayed behind
c80277	to beg Queen Esther for his life,
c80278	for he realized
c80279	the king was planning a terrible fate for him.
c80280	Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall,
c80281	Haman was falling on the couch
c80282	where Esther [was reclining].
c80283	The king exclaimed,
c80284	“Would he actually assault the queen while I am in the palace?”
c80285	As soon as the words had left the king's mouth,
c80286	they covered Haman's face.
c80287	Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said:
c80288	“There is a gallows
c80289	at Haman's ... had it built for Mordecai,
c80290	who gave the report that saved the king.”
c80291	house. [He]
c80292	fifty cubits high
c80293	declared the king.
c80294	“Hang him on it!”
c80295	So they hanged Haman on the gallows
c80296	he had prepared for Mordecai.
c80297	Then the fury of the king subsided.
c80298	That same day King Xerxes awarded Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews.
c80299	And Mordecai entered the king’s presence
c80300	because Esther had revealed
c80301	his relation to her.
c80302	The king removed the signet ring
c80303	he had recovered from Haman
c80304	and presented it to Mordecai.
c80305	And Esther appointed him over the estate of Haman.
c80306	And once again, Esther
c80307	addressed the king. ... at
c80308	She fell ... his feet
c80309	weeping
c80310	and begged
c80311	him to revoke the evil scheme of Haman the Agagite,
c80312	which he had devised against the Jews.
c80313	The king extended the gold scepter toward Esther,
c80314	and [she] arose
c80315	and stood before the king.
c80316	she said,
c80317	“If it pleases the king,”
c80318	“and if I have found favor in his sight,
c80319	and the matter [seems] proper to the king,
c80320	and I am pleasing in his sight,
c80321	may an order be written
c80322	to revoke the letters that the scheming Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite,
c80323	wrote
c80324	to destroy the Jews
c80325	in all the king’s provinces.
c80326	For how could I bear
c80327	to see the disaster
c80328	that would befall my people?
c80329	How could I bear
c80330	to see the destruction of my kindred?”
c80331	So King Xerxes said to Esther the Queen and Mordecai the Jew,
c80332	“Behold, I have given Haman’s estate to Esther,
c80333	and he was hanged on the gallows
c80334	because he attacked the Jews.
c80335	Now you may write in the king’s name as you please regarding the Jews,
c80336	and seal it with the royal signet ring.
c80337	For a decree
c80338	that is written in the name of the king
c80339	and sealed with the royal signet ring
c80340	cannot
c80341	be revoked.”
c80342	At once the royal scribes were summoned, ... of the third month (vvv
c80343	the month of Sivan),
c80344	and on the twenty-third [day]
c80345	they recorded all of
c80346	Mordecai's orders
c80347	to the Jews and to the satraps, governors, and princes ... provinces
c80348	from India to Cush—
c80349	of the 127 ... [writing] to each province
c80350	in its own script,
c80351	to every people in their own language,
c80352	and to the Jews in their own script and language.
c80353	Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes
c80354	and sealed it with the royal signet ring.
c80355	He sent the documents by mounted couriers
c80356	riding on swift horses bred from the royal mares.
c80357	By these letters the king permitted the Jews
c80358	in each and every city
c80359	the right to assemble
c80360	and defend themselves,
c80361	to destroy,
c80362	kill,
c80363	and annihilate all the forces of any people or province
c80364	hostile to them,
c80365	including women and children,
c80366	and to plunder
c80367	their possessions.
c80368	The single day [appointed] throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes [was] the thirteenth day of the twelfth month,
c80369	the month of Adar.
c80370	A copy of the text,
c80371	issued as law throughout every province,
c80372	was distributed to all the peoples,
c80373	so that the Jews would be prepared on that day
c80374	to avenge themselves on their enemies.
c80375	The couriers rode out ... on their royal horses,
c80376	in haste ... pressed on
c80377	by the command of the king.
c80378	And the edict was also issued in the citadel of Susa.
c80379	Mordecai went out from the presence of the king arrayed in royal purple and white, with a large gold crown and a purple robe of fine linen.
c80380	And the city of Susa shouted
c80381	and rejoiced.
c80382	For the Jews it was a time of light and gladness, of joy and honor.
c80383	In every province and every city, wherever
c80384	the king’s edict and decree reached,
c80385	there was joy and gladness among the Jews,
c80386	with feasting and celebrating.
c80387	And many of the people of the land themselves became Jews,
c80388	because the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.
c80389	of the twelfth month,
c80390	the month of Adar,
c80391	On the thirteenth day
c80392	the king's command and edict
c80393	were to be executed.
c80394	On this day
c80395	the enemies of the Jews had hoped
c80396	to overpower them,
c80397	but the tables were turned
c80398	and the Jews overpowered those who hated them.
c80399	In each of the provinces of King Xerxes, the Jews assembled in their cities
c80400	to attack those who sought to harm them.
c80401	No man could withstand them,
c80402	because the fear of them had fallen upon all peoples.
c80403	And all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, ... administrators
c80404	and the king's
c80405	helped the Jews,
c80406	because the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon them.
c80407	For Mordecai exercised great power in the palace,
c80408	and his fame spread throughout the provinces
c80409	as he became
c80410	more and more powerful.
c80411	The Jews put all their enemies to the sword, killing and destroying them,
c80412	and they did what they pleased to those who hated them.
c80413	In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed
c80414	and destroyed five hundred men,
c80415	including Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
c80416	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
c80417	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha.
c80418	They killed these ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews,
c80419	but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.
c80420	On that day the number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king,
c80421	who said to Queen Esther,
c80422	“In the citadel of Susa the Jews have killed
c80423	and destroyed five hundred men,
c80424	including Haman’s ten sons.
c80425	in the rest of the royal provinces?
c80426	What have they done
c80427	Now what [is] your petition?
c80428	It will be given to you.
c80429	And what further do you request?
c80430	It will be fulfilled.”
c80431	Esther replied,
c80432	“If it pleases the king,
c80433	may the Jews ... also have tomorrow
c80434	in Susa
c80435	to carry out today’s edict,
c80436	and may the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”
c80437	So the king commanded
c80438	that this be done.
c80439	An edict was issued in Susa,
c80440	and they hanged the ten sons of Haman.
c80441	the Jews ... came together
c80442	in Susa
c80443	On the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, ... again
c80444	and put to death three hundred men [there],
c80445	but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.
c80446	The rest of the Jews
c80447	in the royal provinces
c80448	also assembled
c80449	to defend themselves
c80450	and rid themselves of their enemies.
c80451	They killed 75,000 who hated them,
c80452	but did not lay a hand on the plunder.
c80453	This was done on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar,
c80454	and on the fourteenth day they rested,
c80455	making it a day of feasting and joy.
c80456	The Jews
c80457	in Susa, however,
c80458	had assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth days of the month.
c80459	So they rested on the fifteenth day,
c80460	making it a day of feasting and joy.
c80461	This is why the rural Jews,
c80462	who live in the villages,
c80463	observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting.
c80464	It is a holiday for sending gifts to one another.
c80465	Mordecai recorded these events
c80466	and sent letters to all the Jews
c80467	in all the provinces of King Xerxes,
c80468	both near
c80469	and far,
c80470	to establish among them
c80471	an annual celebration on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar
c80472	as the days
c80473	on which the Jews had rid themselves of their enemies
c80474	and the month
c80475	in which their sorrow had turned to joy
c80476	and their mourning into a holiday.
c80477	[He wrote] that these were to be days of feasting and joy,
c80478	of sending gifts to one another
c80479	[and] to the poor.
c80480	So the Jews agreed to continue
c80481	they had started,
c80482	the custom
c80483	as Mordecai had written to them.
c80484	For Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews
c80485	to destroy them
c80486	and had cast the Pur
c80487	(that is, the lot)
c80488	to crush
c80489	and destroy them.
c80491	But when it came before the king,
c80492	he commanded by letter
c80493	that the wicked scheme ... should come back
c80494	which Haman had devised against the Jews
c80495	on his own head,
c80496	and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
c80497	Therefore these days are called Purim, from the word Pur.
c80498	Because of all the instructions in this letter,
c80499	and because of all they had seen
c80500	and experienced,
c80501	to establish the custom
c80502	the Jews bound themselves ... that they and their descendants and all
c80503	who join them
c80504	should not fail
c80505	to celebrate these two days at the [appointed] time each and every year, according to their regulation.
c80506	These days [should be] remembered
c80507	and celebrated by every generation, family, province, and city,
c80508	so that these days of Purim should not fail [to be observed] among the Jews,
c80509	nor should the memory of them fade from their descendants.
c80510	So Queen Esther daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority
c80511	to confirm this second letter concerning Purim.
c80512	And [Mordecai] sent letters [with] words of peace and truth to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Xerxes,
c80513	in order to confirm these days of Purim at their [appointed] time,
c80514	just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established them
c80515	[and] had committed themselves and their descendants to the times of fasting and lamentation.
c80516	So Esther’s decree confirmed these regulations about Purim,
c80517	which were written into the record.
c80518	King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the land, even to its farthest shores.
c80519	And all of Mordecai's powerful and magnificent accomplishments, together with the full account of the greatness
c80520	to which the king had raised him,
c80521	are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?
c80522	For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Xerxes,
c80523	preeminent among the Jews
c80524	and highly favored by his many kinsmen,
c80525	seeking the good of his people
c80526	and speaking peace to all his countrymen.
c80527	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem
c80528	and besieged it.
c80529	And the Lord delivered into his hand Jehoiakim king of Judah, along with some of the articles from the house of God.
c80530	He carried [these] off to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god,
c80531	[where] he put [them] into the treasury of his god.
c80532	Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his court officials,
c80533	to bring in some Israelites from the royal family and the nobility—
c80534	young men
c80535	without blemish,
c80536	handsome,
c80537	gifted in all wisdom,
c80538	knowledgeable,
c80539	quick to understand,
c80540	and qualified
c80541	to serve in the king’s palace—
c80542	and to teach them the language and literature of the Chaldeans.
c80543	The king assigned them daily provisions of the royal food and wine.
c80544	They were to be trained for three years,
c80545	at the end of which they were to enter the king’s service.
c80546	were some
c80547	Among these [young men] ... [from] Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
c80548	The chief official gave them new names:
c80549	To Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar;
c80550	to Hananiah, Shadrach;
c80551	to Mishael, Meshach;
c80552	and to Azariah, Abednego.
c80553	But Daniel resolved in his heart
c80554	that he would not defile himself with the king’s food or wine.
c80555	So he asked the chief official
c80556	for permission not to defile himself.
c80557	Now God had granted Daniel favor and compassion from the chief official,
c80558	but he said to Daniel,
c80559	“I fear my lord the king,
c80560	who has assigned your food and drink.
c80561	For why should he see your faces
c80562	looking thinner than those of the other young men
c80563	your age?
c80564	You would endanger my head before the king.”
c80565	Then Daniel said to the steward
c80566	whom the chief official had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
c80567	“Please test your servants for ten days.
c80568	Let us be given only vegetables
c80569	to eat
c80570	and water
c80571	to drink.
c80572	Then compare our appearances with those of the young men
c80573	who are eating the royal food,
c80575	according to what you see.”
c80576	and deal with your servants
c80577	So he consented to this
c80578	and tested them for ten days.
c80579	And at the end of ten days, their appearance was
c80580	better and healthier than all the young men
c80581	who were eating the king’s food.
c80582	Thus
c80583	the steward continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink,
c80584	and he gave them vegetables [instead].
c80585	To these four young men
c80586	God gave knowledge
c80587	and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom.
c80588	And Daniel had insight into all kinds of visions and dreams.
c80589	Now at the end of the time
c80590	specified by the king,
c80592	the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.
c80593	And the king spoke with them, and among
c80594	all [the young men] he found no one equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
c80595	So they entered the king's service.
c80596	In every matter of wisdom and understanding
c80597	about which the king consulted them,
c80598	he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters
c80599	in his entire kingdom.
c80600	And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
c80601	In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams
c80602	that troubled his spirit,
c80603	and sleep deserted him.
c80604	So the king gave orders
c80605	to summon the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers
c80606	to explain his dreams.
c80607	When they came
c80608	and stood before the king,
c80609	he said to them,
c80610	“I have had a dream,
c80611	and my spirit is anxious
c80612	to understand it.”
c80613	Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic,
c80614	“O king,
c80615	may you live forever!
c80616	Tell your servants the dream,
c80617	and we will give the interpretation.”
c80618	The king replied
c80619	to the astrologers,
c80620	“My word is final:
c80621	If you do not tell me the dream and its interpretation,
c80622	you will be cut into pieces
c80623	and your houses will be reduced to rubble.
c80624	But if you tell me the dream and its interpretation,
c80625	you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor.
c80626	So tell me the dream and its interpretation.”
c80627	They answered a second time,
c80628	tell
c80629	“Let the king ... the dream to his servants,
c80630	and we will give the interpretation.”
c80631	The king replied,
c80633	“I know for sure
c80634	you are stalling for time,
c80635	because you see that
c80636	my word is final.
c80637	If you do not tell me the dream,
c80638	[there] is [only] one decree for you.
c80639	You have conspired ... false and fraudulent words,
c80640	to speak before me
c80641	hoping the situation will change.
c80642	Therefore tell me the dream,
c80643	and I will know
c80644	that you can give me its interpretation.”
c80645	The astrologers answered the king,
c80647	“No one on earth
c80648	can ... what the king requests!
c80649	do
c80650	No king, however great and powerful, has ever asked anything like this of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer.
c80652	What the king requests
c80653	is so difficult
c80654	that no one ... is
c80655	can tell it to him ... whose
c80656	except the gods,
c80657	dwelling
c80658	not with mortals.”
c80659	This [response] made the king ... angry ... all
c80660	so ... and furious
c80661	that he gave orders
c80662	to destroy ... the wise men of Babylon.
c80663	So the decree went out
c80664	that the wise men were to be executed,
c80665	and men went to look for Daniel and his friends
c80666	to execute them.
c80667	When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, ... Daniel replied with discretion and tact.
c80668	had gone out
c80669	to execute the wise men of Babylon,
c80670	he asked.
c80672	“Why is the decree from the king so harsh?”
c80673	At this time Arioch explained the situation to Daniel.
c80674	So Daniel went in
c80675	and asked the king
c80676	to give him some time,
c80677	so that he could give [him] the interpretation.
c80678	Then Daniel returned to his house
c80679	and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
c80680	urging them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery,
c80681	so that Daniel and his friends would not be killed with the rest of the wise [men] of Babylon.
c80682	During the night, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision,
c80683	and [he] blessed the God of heaven
c80685	and declared:
c80686	“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,
c80687	for wisdom and power
c80688	belong to Him.
c80689	He changes the times and seasons;
c80690	He removes kings
c80691	and establishes [them].
c80692	He gives wisdom to the wise
c80693	and knowledge to the discerning.
c80694	He reveals the deep and hidden things;
c80695	He knows what lies in darkness,
c80696	and light dwells with Him.
c80697	To You,
c80698	O God of my fathers,
c80699	give thanks
c80700	I ... and praise,
c80701	because You have given me wisdom and power.
c80702	And now You have made known to me
c80703	what we have requested,
c80704	for You have made known to us the dream of the king.
c80705	Therefore Daniel went to Arioch,
c80706	whom the king had appointed
c80707	to destroy the wise men of Babylon,
c80709	and said to him,
c80710	“Do not execute the wise men of Babylon!
c80711	Bring me before the king,
c80712	and I will give him the interpretation.”
c80713	Arioch hastily brought Daniel before the king
c80714	and said to him,
c80715	“I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who
c80716	will tell the king the interpretation.”
c80717	The king responded
c80718	to Daniel,
c80719	whose name was Belteshazzar,
c80720	“Are you able
c80721	to tell me ... in the dream,
c80722	what I saw
c80723	as well as its interpretation?”
c80724	Daniel answered the king,
c80726	the mystery
c80727	to the king ... of which ... inquires.
c80728	“No wise man, medium, magician, or diviner can
c80729	explain ... [he]
c80730	But there is a God in heaven
c80731	who reveals mysteries,
c80732	and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what
c80733	will happen in the latter days.
c80734	Your dream and the visions that came into your mind as you lay on your bed
c80735	were these:
c80736	As you
c80737	O king,
c80738	lay on your bed, ... your thoughts turned
c80739	to
c80740	the future,
c80742	and the Revealer of Mysteries
c80743	has let you know what
c80744	will happen.
c80745	And to me
c80746	not ... more wisdom
c80747	because I have ... than any man alive,
c80748	this mystery has been revealed,
c80749	but in order that
c80750	the interpretation might be made known to the king,
c80751	and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.
c80752	As you,
c80753	O king,
c80754	were watching,
c80755	a great statue appeared.
c80756	A great ... statue
c80757	and dazzling
c80758	stood before you,
c80759	and its form [was] awesome.
c80760	of the statue
c80761	The head ... was pure gold,
c80762	its chest and arms were silver,
c80763	its belly and thighs were bronze,
c80764	its legs were iron,
c80765	and its feet
c80766	were part iron
c80767	and part clay.
c80768	While you were watching,
c80769	a stone was cut out, ... of
c80770	but not by human hands.
c80771	It struck the statue on its feet
c80772	iron and clay,
c80773	and crushed them.
c80774	Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were shattered
c80775	and became like chaff on the threshing floor in summer.
c80776	The wind carried them away,
c80777	and not a trace of them could be found. ... the whole
c80778	But the stone
c80779	that had struck the statue
c80780	became a great mountain
c80781	and filled ... earth.
c80782	This was the dream;
c80783	now we will tell the king its interpretation.
c80784	You,
c80785	O king,
c80786	are the king of kings,
c80787	to whom the God of heaven has given sovereignty, power, strength, and glory.
c80788	Wherever
c80789	the sons of men ... dwell,
c80790	or beasts of the field or birds of the air ... He has given [them] into your hand
c80791	and has made you ruler over them all.
c80792	You [are] that head of gold.
c80793	But after you, there will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours.
c80794	Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze,
c80795	will rule the whole earth.
c80796	Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron;
c80797	for iron shatters ... all things,
c80798	and crushes ... all
c80799	and like iron
c80800	that crushes all things, ... the others.
c80801	it will shatter
c80802	and crush
c80803	And just as you saw that the feet and toes
c80804	were made partly of fired clay ... some of
c80805	iron,
c80806	so this will be a divided kingdom,
c80807	and partly of ... the strength of iron will be in it—
c80808	yet ... just as you saw
c80809	the iron mixed with clay.
c80810	And as the toes of the feet
c80811	were partly iron
c80812	clay,
c80813	and partly ... so this kingdom will be partly strong
c80814	and partly brittle.
c80815	As you saw ... any more than
c80816	the iron mixed with clay,
c80817	so the peoples will mix with one another,
c80818	but will not hold together
c80821	iron mixes with clay.
c80822	In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that
c80823	will never be destroyed,
c80824	and this kingdom will not be left to another people.
c80825	It will shatter
c80826	all these kingdoms and bring them to an end,
c80827	but will itself stand forever.
c80828	And just as you saw
c80829	a stone cut out of the mountain
c80830	without human hands,
c80831	and it shattered the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold,
c80832	so the great God has told the king what
c80833	will happen in the future.
c80834	The dream is true,
c80835	and its interpretation is trustworthy.”
c80836	At this, King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face,
c80837	paid homage to Daniel,
c80838	and ordered that an offering of incense
c80839	be presented to him.
c80840	The king said to Daniel,
c80842	is truly
c80843	“Your God ... the God of gods and Lord of kings, ... since
c80844	a revealer of mysteries,
c80845	you were able
c80846	to reveal this mystery.”
c80847	Then the king promoted Daniel
c80848	and gave him many ... gifts.
c80849	He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon
c80850	generous ... and administrator over all the wise men of Babylon.
c80851	And at Daniel’s request, the king
c80852	appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to manage the province of Babylon,
c80853	while Daniel remained at the king’s court.
c80854	King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue
c80855	sixty cubits high
c80856	and six cubits wide,
c80857	and he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
c80858	Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent
c80859	word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other officials of the provinces
c80860	to attend the dedication of the statue
c80861	[he] had set up.
c80862	So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue
c80863	that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up,
c80864	and they stood before [it].
c80866	Then the herald loudly proclaimed,
c80867	[this is what] you are commanded:
c80868	“O peoples, nations, and [men of every] language,
c80869	As soon as
c80870	you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music,
c80871	you must fall down
c80872	and worship the golden statue that
c80873	King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
c80874	And whoever
c80875	does not fall down
c80876	and worship
c80877	will immediately be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.”
c80878	Therefore,
c80879	as soon as all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and all kinds of music,
c80880	the people of every nation and language fell down
c80881	and worshiped the golden statue
c80882	that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
c80883	At this time some astrologers came forward
c80884	and maliciously accused the Jews,
c80885	saying
c80886	to King Nebuchadnezzar,
c80887	“O king,
c80888	may you live forever!
c80889	You,
c80890	O king,
c80891	have issued a decree
c80892	that everyone
c80893	who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music
c80894	must fall down
c80895	and worship the golden statue,
c80896	and that whoever
c80897	does not fall down
c80898	and worship
c80899	will be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.
c80900	But there are some Jews
c80901	you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon—
c80902	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—
c80903	[who] have ignored
c80904	O king,
c80905	you,
c80906	and have refused to serve your gods
c80907	the golden statue
c80908	you have set up.”
c80909	or worship
c80910	Then Nebuchadnezzar, furious with rage, summoned
c80911	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
c80912	So these men were brought before the king,
c80913	and Nebuchadnezzar
c80914	said to them,
c80915	is it true
c80916	“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
c80917	that you do not serve my gods
c80918	the golden statue
c80919	I have set up?
c80920	or worship
c80921	Now,
c80922	if you are ready,
c80923	as soon as
c80924	you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music,
c80925	you must fall down
c80926	and worship the statue
c80927	I have made.
c80928	But if you refuse to worship,
c80929	you will be thrown immediately into the burning fiery furnace.
c80930	Then what god will be able
c80931	to deliver you from my hands?”
c80932	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied
c80933	to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar,
c80934	we have no need
c80935	to answer you in this matter.
c80936	If the God ... exists,
c80937	whom we serve
c80938	then He is able
c80939	to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace
c80940	and from your hand,
c80941	O king.
c80943	But even if He does not,
c80944	let it be known to you,
c80945	O king,
c80946	that we will not serve your gods
c80947	the golden statue
c80948	you have set up.”
c80949	or worship
c80950	At this, Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage,
c80951	and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
c80952	He gave orders
c80954	to heat the furnace seven times
c80955	hotter than usual,
c80957	mighty warriors
c80958	in his army
c80959	and he commanded
c80960	to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
c80961	and throw them into the burning fiery furnace.
c80962	So [they] were tied up, wearing robes, trousers, turbans, and other clothes,
c80963	and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace.
c80965	The king’s command was so urgent
c80966	and the furnace so hot
c80967	the men
c80968	who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
c80969	that the fiery flames killed
c80970	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ... fell into the burning fiery furnace.
c80971	firmly bound,
c80972	Suddenly King Nebuchadnezzar
c80973	jumped up
c80974	in amazement
c80975	they replied.
c80976	and asked his advisers,
c80977	“Did we not throw three men, ... into the fire?”
c80978	firmly bound,
c80980	O king,”
c80981	“Certainly,
c80984	he exclaimed.
c80985	“Look!” ... “I see four men,
c80986	unbound
c80987	walking around in the fire—
c80988	and unharmed,
c80989	and the fourth looks like a son of the gods!”
c80990	Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the burning fiery furnace
c80992	and called out,
c80993	“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God,
c80994	come out!”
c80996	So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire,
c80997	and when the satraps, prefects, governors, and royal advisers had gathered around,
c80998	they saw ... of these men:
c80999	that the fire had no effect on the bodies
c81000	Not a hair of their heads was singed,
c81001	their robes were unaffected,
c81002	and there was no smell of fire on them.
c81003	Nebuchadnezzar declared,
c81005	“Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
c81006	who has sent His Angel ... who
c81007	and delivered His servants
c81008	trusted in Him.
c81009	They violated the king’s command
c81010	and risked their lives
c81011	rather than serve
c81012	or worship any god
c81013	except their own God.
c81014	Therefore I decree
c81015	that the people of any nation or language
c81016	who say anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
c81017	will be cut into pieces
c81018	and their houses will be reduced to rubble.
c81019	For there is no other god
c81020	who can
c81021	deliver in this way.”
c81022	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
c81023	King Nebuchadnezzar, To the peoples, nations, and [men of] every language
c81024	who dwell in all the earth:
c81025	May your prosperity be multiplied.
c81026	the signs and wonders
c81027	that the Most High God has performed for me:
c81028	I am pleased
c81029	to declare
c81030	How great [are] His signs,
c81031	and how mighty His wonders!
c81032	His kingdom is an eternal kingdom,
c81033	and His dominion endures from generation to generation.
c81034	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house
c81035	and flourishing in my palace.
c81036	I had a dream,
c81037	and it frightened me;
c81038	while in my bed, the images and visions in my mind alarmed me.
c81039	So I issued a decree
c81040	that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me
c81041	to interpret the dream for me.
c81042	When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners came in,
c81043	I told them the dream,
c81044	and they could not interpret it for me.
c81045	But at last, Daniel came into my presence
c81046	([his] name is Belteshazzar, after the name of my god,
c81047	and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)
c81048	And I told him the dream:
c81049	“O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians,
c81050	because I know
c81051	that you have a spirit of the holy gods
c81052	and that no mystery baffles you,
c81053	the visions ... in my dream,
c81054	that I saw
c81055	explain to me ... and the interpretation.
c81056	In these visions of my mind as I was lying in bed, I saw this come to pass:
c81057	There was a tree in the middle of the land,
c81058	and its height was great.
c81059	The tree grew large
c81060	and strong;
c81061	its top reached the sky,
c81062	and it was visible to the ends of the earth.
c81063	Its leaves were beautiful,
c81064	its fruit was abundant,
c81065	and upon it was food for all.
c81066	Under it the beasts of the field found shelter,
c81067	in its branches the birds of the air nested,
c81068	and from it every creature was fed.
c81069	As I lay on my bed, I also saw in the visions of my mind
c81070	a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven.
c81071	He called out in a loud voice:
c81073	‘Cut down the tree
c81074	and chop off its branches;
c81075	strip off its leaves
c81076	and scatter its fruit.
c81077	Let the beasts flee from under it,
c81078	and the birds from its branches.
c81079	But leave the stump with its roots in the ground,
c81080	and a band of iron and bronze around it, in the tender grass of the field.
c81081	Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven
c81082	and graze with the beasts on the grass of the earth.
c81083	Let his mind be changed from that of a man,
c81084	and let him be given the mind of a beast
c81085	till seven times pass him by.
c81086	This decision is the decree of the watchers,
c81087	the verdict declared by the holy ones,
c81088	so that the living will know
c81089	that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of mankind,
c81090	to whom
c81091	He wishes,
c81092	and gives it
c81093	setting over it the lowliest of men.’
c81094	This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had.
c81095	But you
c81096	Now, Belteshazzar,
c81097	tell me the interpretation,
c81098	because none of the wise men of my kingdom can
c81099	interpret it for me.
c81100	[are] able,
c81101	because the spirit of the holy gods [is] in you.”
c81102	For ... Daniel,
c81103	who was also known as Belteshazzar,
c81104	a time, ... was perplexed,
c81105	and his thoughts alarmed him.
c81106	So the king said,
c81108	“Belteshazzar,
c81109	do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.”
c81110	replied Belteshazzar,
c81112	“My lord,”
c81113	“may the dream apply to those who hate you,
c81114	and its interpretation to your enemies!
c81115	The tree
c81116	you saw, which
c81117	grew large
c81118	and strong,
c81119	whose top reached the sky
c81120	and was visible to all the earth,
c81121	whose foliage was beautiful
c81122	and its fruit abundant,
c81123	providing food for all,
c81124	under which the beasts of the field lived,
c81125	and in whose branches the birds of the air nested—
c81126	you, ... are [that tree]!
c81127	O king,
c81128	For you have become great
c81129	and strong;
c81130	your greatness has grown
c81131	to reach the sky,
c81132	and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth.
c81133	And you, O king, saw
c81134	a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven
c81135	and saying:
c81136	‘Cut down the tree
c81137	and destroy it,
c81138	but leave the stump with its roots in the ground,
c81139	with a band of iron and bronze [around it], in the tender grass of the field.
c81140	Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven,
c81141	and graze with the beasts of the field
c81142	till seven times pass him by.’
c81143	This is the interpretation,
c81144	O king,
c81145	and this is the decree that the Most High
c81146	has issued against my lord the king:
c81147	You will be driven away from mankind,
c81148	and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field.
c81149	You will feed on grass like cattle
c81150	and be drenched with the dew of heaven,
c81151	and seven times shall pass you by,
c81152	until you acknowledge
c81153	that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of mankind,
c81154	it to anyone
c81155	He wishes.
c81156	and He gives
c81157	As for the command
c81158	to leave the stump of the tree with its roots, ... that
c81159	your kingdom will be restored
c81160	to you as soon as you acknowledge
c81161	Heaven rules.
c81162	Therefore,
c81163	O king.
c81164	may my advice be pleasing to you,
c81165	Break away from your sins by doing what is right,
c81166	and from your iniquities
c81167	by showing mercy to the oppressed.
c81168	Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity.”
c81169	All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
c81170	Twelve months later, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,
c81171	the king exclaimed,
c81173	“Is this not Babylon the Great,
c81174	which I myself have built by the might of my power as a royal residence
c81175	and for the glory of my majesty?”
c81176	While the words were still in the king’s mouth,
c81177	a voice came from heaven:
c81178	“It is decreed to you,
c81179	King Nebuchadnezzar,
c81180	that the kingdom has departed from you.
c81181	You will be driven away from mankind
c81182	to live with the beasts of the field,
c81183	and you will feed on grass like cattle.
c81184	And seven times will pass you by,
c81185	until you acknowledge
c81186	that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men,
c81187	it to anyone
c81188	He wishes.”
c81189	and He gives
c81190	At that moment the sentence against Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled.
c81191	He was driven away from mankind.
c81192	He ate grass like cattle,
c81193	and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven,
c81194	until his hair grew like [the feathers of] an eagle
c81195	and his nails like [the claws of] a bird.
c81196	But at the end of those days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven,
c81197	and my sanity was restored to me.
c81198	Then I praised the Most High,
c81199	and I honored ... Him who lives forever:
c81200	and glorified
c81201	“For His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
c81202	and His kingdom endures from generation to generation.
c81203	All the peoples of the earth are counted as nothing,
c81204	and He does as He pleases with the army of heaven and the peoples of the earth.
c81205	There is no
c81206	one who can restrain His hand
c81207	or say to Him,
c81208	‘What have You done?’”
c81209	At the same time my sanity was restored to me,
c81210	and my honor and splendor returned to me for the glory of my kingdom.
c81211	My advisers and nobles sought me out,
c81212	and I was restored to my throne,
c81213	and surpassing greatness was added to me.
c81214	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise
c81215	and exalt
c81216	and glorify the King of heaven,
c81217	for all His works are true,
c81218	and all His ways are just.
c81220	And those who walk in pride
c81221	He is able
c81222	to humble.
c81223	[Many years later] King Belshazzar held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles,
c81224	and he drank wine with them.
c81225	Under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar gave orders
c81226	to bring in the gold and silver vessels
c81227	that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple
c81228	in Jerusalem,
c81229	so that the king could drink from them, along with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines.
c81230	Thus they brought in the gold vessels
c81231	that had been taken from the temple, the house of God
c81232	in Jerusalem,
c81233	and the king drank from them, along with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines.
c81234	As they drank the wine,
c81235	they praised their gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone.
c81236	At that moment the fingers of a human hand appeared
c81237	and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace.
c81238	As the king watched the hand
c81239	that was writing,
c81241	his face grew pale
c81242	and his thoughts so alarmed him
c81243	that his hips gave way
c81244	and his knees
c81245	knocked together.
c81247	The king called out for
c81248	the enchanters, astrologers, and diviners to be brought in,
c81249	and he
c81250	said to these wise men of Babylon,
c81251	“Whoever
c81252	reads this inscription
c81253	and tells me its interpretation
c81254	will be clothed in purple
c81255	and have a gold chain placed around his neck,
c81256	and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”
c81257	So all the king’s wise men came in,
c81258	but they could not
c81259	read the inscription
c81260	or interpret it for [him].
c81261	Then King Belshazzar became even more terrified,
c81262	his face grew even more pale,
c81263	and his nobles were bewildered.
c81264	Hearing the outcry of the king and his nobles, the queen entered the banquet hall.
c81266	she said.
c81267	“O king,
c81268	may you live forever,”
c81269	“Do not let your thoughts terrify you,
c81270	or your face grow pale.
c81271	There is a man in your kingdom
c81272	who has the spirit of the holy gods in him.
c81273	In the days of your father he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like [that] of the gods.
c81274	Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, [and] diviners.
c81275	Your own father, the king,
c81276	did this because ... to have an extraordinary spirit, as well as knowledge, understanding,
c81277	and the ability to interpret dreams,
c81278	explain riddles,
c81279	and solve difficult problems.
c81280	Daniel, ... was found
c81281	the one [he] named Belteshazzar,
c81282	Summon Daniel, therefore,
c81283	and he will give you the interpretation.”
c81284	So Daniel was brought before the king,
c81285	[who]
c81286	asked him,
c81287	“Are you Daniel,
c81288	one of the exiles
c81289	my father the king brought from Judah?
c81290	I have heard
c81291	that the spirit of the gods is in you,
c81292	and that you have insight, intelligence, and extraordinary wisdom.
c81293	Now the wise men and enchanters were brought before me
c81294	to read this inscription
c81295	and interpret it for me,
c81296	but they could not
c81297	give its interpretation.
c81298	But I have heard
c81299	that you are able
c81300	to give interpretations
c81301	and solve difficult problems.
c81302	Therefore,
c81303	if you can
c81304	read this inscription
c81305	and give me its interpretation,
c81306	you will be clothed in purple
c81307	about you, ... and have a gold chain placed around your neck,
c81308	and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”
c81309	In response, Daniel
c81310	said to the king,
c81311	“You may keep your gifts for yourself
c81312	and give your rewards to someone else.
c81313	Nevertheless, I will read the inscription for the king
c81314	and interpret it for him.
c81315	As for you,
c81316	O king,
c81317	the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness, glory and honor.
c81318	Because of the greatness
c81319	that He bestowed on him,
c81320	all peoples, nations, and [men of every] language trembled
c81321	in fear before him.
c81322	whom he wished ... whom
c81323	He killed
c81325	he wished; ... whom
c81326	and kept alive
c81328	he wished ... whom
c81329	he exalted
c81331	he wished.
c81332	and humbled
c81333	But when his heart was exalted
c81334	and his spirit hardened
c81335	in pride,
c81336	he was deposed from his royal throne,
c81337	and his glory was taken from him.
c81338	He was driven away from mankind,
c81339	and his mind was like [that of] a beast.
c81340	He lived with the wild donkeys
c81341	and ate grass like cattle,
c81342	and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven
c81343	until he acknowledged
c81344	that the Most High God is ruler over the kingdom of mankind,
c81345	whom
c81346	He wishes.
c81347	and He sets over it
c81348	But you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart,
c81349	even though you knew all this.
c81350	Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven.
c81351	The vessels from His house were brought to you,
c81352	and as you drank wine from them with your nobles, wives, and concubines,
c81353	gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone,
c81354	which cannot see
c81355	or hear
c81356	or understand.
c81357	you praised
c81358	the God
c81359	who [holds] in His hand your very breath
c81360	and all your ways.
c81361	But you have failed to glorify
c81362	Therefore He sent the hand
c81363	that wrote the inscription.
c81364	Now this is the inscription
c81365	that was written:
c81366	MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN.
c81367	[And] this is the interpretation of the message:
c81368	MENE
c81369	means that God has numbered the days of your reign
c81370	and brought it to an end.
c81371	TEKEL
c81372	means that you have been weighed on the scales
c81373	and found deficient.
c81374	PERES
c81375	means that your kingdom has been divided
c81376	and given over to the Medes and Persians.”
c81377	Then Belshazzar gave the command,
c81378	and they clothed Daniel in purple,
c81379	placed a gold chain around his neck,
c81380	and proclaimed him
c81381	the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
c81382	That very night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans was slain,
c81383	and Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the age of sixty-two.
c81384	Now it pleased Darius
c81385	to appoint 120 satraps
c81386	to rule throughout the kingdom,
c81387	and over them three administrators,
c81388	including Daniel,
c81389	to whom these satraps were accountable
c81390	so that the king would not suffer loss.
c81391	Soon, ... Daniel distinguished himself among the administrators and satraps.
c81392	by his extraordinary spirit,
c81393	So the king planned
c81394	to set him over the whole kingdom.
c81395	Thus the administrators and satraps sought a charge
c81396	against Daniel concerning the kingdom,
c81397	but they could ... no charge or corruption,
c81398	find
c81399	because he was trustworthy, and no
c81400	negligence or corruption was found in him.
c81401	Finally these men said,
c81402	“We will never find any charge against this Daniel,
c81403	unless we find [something] against him concerning the law of his God.”
c81404	So the administrators and satraps went together to the king
c81405	and said,
c81406	“O King Darius,
c81407	may you live forever!
c81408	All the royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers, and governors have agreed
c81409	that the king should establish an ordinance
c81410	and enforce a decree
c81411	that ... anyone
c81412	for thirty days ... who petitions any god or man
c81413	except you,
c81414	O king,
c81415	will be thrown into the den of lions.
c81416	Therefore,
c81417	O king,
c81418	establish the decree
c81419	and sign the document
c81420	so that it cannot be changed— in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians,
c81421	which cannot be repealed.”
c81422	Therefore King Darius signed the written decree.
c81423	Daniel
c81424	Now when ... learned
c81425	that the document had been signed,
c81426	he went into his house,
c81427	where the windows of his upper room opened toward Jerusalem,
c81428	and three times a day he got down on his knees,
c81429	prayed,
c81430	and gave thanks to his God,
c81431	just as he had done before.
c81432	Then these men went as a group
c81433	and found Daniel
c81434	petitioning
c81435	and imploring his God.
c81436	So they approached
c81437	the king and asked about his royal decree:
c81438	“Did you not sign a decree
c81439	that ... any man
c81440	for thirty days ... who petitions any god or man
c81441	except you,
c81442	O king,
c81443	will be thrown into the den of lions?”
c81444	The king replied,
c81446	“According to the law of the Medes and Persians, the order stands
c81447	and it cannot be repealed.”
c81448	Then they told
c81449	the king,
c81450	“Daniel, one
c81451	of the exiles from Judah,
c81452	shows no regard for you,
c81453	O king,
c81455	or for the decree
c81456	that you have signed.
c81457	He still makes his petition three times a day.”
c81458	the king
c81459	As soon as ... heard this,
c81460	he was deeply distressed
c81461	and set [his] mind ... Daniel,
c81462	on delivering
c81463	and he labored until sundown
c81464	to rescue him.
c81465	Then the men approached the king {together}
c81466	and said to him,
c81467	“Remember,
c81468	O king,
c81469	that by the law of the Medes and Persians
c81470	decree or ordinance
c81471	established by the king
c81472	no
c81473	can be changed.”
c81474	So the king gave the order,
c81475	and they brought Daniel
c81476	and threw him into the den of lions.
c81477	The king said
c81478	to Daniel,
c81479	“May your God,
c81480	whom you serve continually,
c81481	deliver you!”
c81482	A stone was brought
c81483	and placed over the mouth of the den,
c81484	and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles,
c81485	so that nothing concerning Daniel could be changed.
c81486	Then the king went to his palace
c81487	and spent the night fasting.
c81488	No entertainment was brought before him,
c81489	and sleep fled from him.
c81490	At the first light of dawn, the king got up
c81491	and hurried to the den of lions.
c81493	When he reached the den,
c81494	he cried out in a voice of anguish,
c81497	“O Daniel, servant of the living God,
c81498	has your God,
c81499	whom you serve continually,
c81500	been able
c81501	to deliver you from the lions?”
c81502	Then Daniel replied,
c81503	“O king,
c81504	may you live forever!
c81505	My God sent His angel
c81506	and shut the mouths of the lions.
c81507	They have not hurt me,
c81508	for I was found innocent in His sight,
c81509	and ... against you,
c81510	O king.”
c81511	I have done no wrong
c81512	The king was overjoyed
c81513	and gave orders ... Daniel
c81514	to lift ... out of the den,
c81515	and when Daniel was lifted out of the den,
c81516	no wounds whatsoever were found on him,
c81517	because he had trusted in his God.
c81518	At the command of the king,
c81519	the men ... were brought
c81520	who had falsely accused Daniel
c81521	and thrown into the den of lions— they and their children and wives.
c81522	And before they had reached the bottom of the den,
c81523	the lions overpowered them
c81524	and crushed all their bones.
c81525	Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and [men of every] language
c81526	throughout the land:
c81527	“May your prosperity abound.
c81528	I hereby decree ... before
c81529	that in every part of my kingdom, [men are to] tremble
c81530	in fear ... the God of Daniel:
c81531	For He is the living God,
c81532	and He endures forever;
c81533	His kingdom
c81534	will never be destroyed,
c81535	and His dominion will never end.
c81536	He delivers
c81537	and rescues;
c81538	He performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth,
c81539	for He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.”
c81540	So Daniel prospered during the reigns of Darius and of Cyrus the Persian.
c81541	In the first year of the reign of Belshazzar over Babylon, Daniel had a dream,
c81542	and visions passed through his mind as he lay on his bed.
c81543	He wrote down the dream,
c81544	and this is the summary of his account.
c81545	Daniel declared:
c81547	“In my vision in the night I looked,
c81548	and suddenly the four winds of heaven were churning up the Great Sea.
c81549	Then four great beasts came up out of the sea,
c81550	different
c81551	each ... from the others.
c81552	The first [beast] was like a lion,
c81553	and it had [the] wings of an eagle.
c81554	I watched
c81555	until its wings were torn off
c81556	and it was lifted up from the ground
c81557	and made to stand on two feet like a man,
c81558	and given the mind of a man.
c81559	Suddenly another beast {appeared}, which looked like a bear.
c81560	It was raised up on one of its sides,
c81561	and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth.
c81562	So it was told,
c81563	‘Get up
c81564	[and] gorge yourself on flesh!’
c81565	Next, as I watched,
c81566	another beast appeared. It was like a leopard,
c81567	and on its back it had four wings like those of a bird.
c81568	The beast also had four heads,
c81569	and it was given authority to rule.
c81570	After this, as I watched in my vision in the night,
c81571	suddenly a fourth beast {appeared}, [and it was] terrifying— dreadful and extremely strong—
c81572	with large iron teeth.
c81573	It devoured
c81574	and crushed;
c81575	then it trampled underfoot whatever was left.
c81576	It was different from all the beasts
c81577	before it,
c81578	and it had ten horns.
c81579	While I was contemplating the horns,
c81580	suddenly another horn, a little one, came up among them,
c81581	and three of the first horns were uprooted before it.
c81582	This horn had eyes like those of a man
c81583	and a mouth that spoke words of arrogance.
c81584	I continued to watch:
c81585	As ... Thrones were set in place,
c81586	and the Ancient of Days took His seat.
c81587	His clothing was white as snow,
c81588	and the hair of His head like pure wool.
c81589	His throne was flaming with fire,
c81590	and its wheels were all ablaze.
c81591	A river of fire was flowing,
c81592	coming out from His presence. ... before Him.
c81593	Thousands upon thousands attended Him,
c81594	and myriads upon myriads stood
c81595	The court was convened,
c81596	and the books were opened.
c81597	Then I kept watching because of the arrogant words ... I continued
c81598	the horn was speaking.
c81599	to watch,
c81600	As ... the beast was slain,
c81601	and its body was destroyed
c81602	and thrown into the blazing fire.
c81603	As for the rest of the beasts,
c81604	their dominion was removed,
c81605	but they were granted an extension of life for a season of time.
c81606	In my vision in the night I continued to watch:
c81607	And I saw One like a Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven.
c81608	He approached the Ancient of Days
c81609	and was led into His presence.
c81610	And He was given dominion, glory, and kingship,
c81611	so that every people, nation, and language should serve Him.
c81612	His dominion is an everlasting dominion
c81613	that will not pass away,
c81614	and His kingdom is one
c81615	that will never be destroyed.
c81616	I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit,
c81617	and the visions in my mind alarmed me.
c81618	I approached one of those who stood by, ... of
c81619	and I asked him the true meaning ... all this.
c81620	So he told me
c81621	the interpretation of these things:
c81622	‘These ... great beasts
c81623	four ... are
c81624	four kings
c81625	[who] will arise from the earth.
c81626	But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom
c81627	and possess it forever— yes, forever and ever.’
c81628	Then I wanted
c81629	to know the true meaning of the fourth beast,
c81630	which was different from all the [others]—
c81631	extremely terrifying—
c81632	with iron teeth
c81633	and bronze claws,
c81634	devouring,
c81635	crushing,
c81636	and trampling underfoot whatever was left.
c81637	I also wanted to know about the ten horns
c81638	on its head ... horn that
c81639	and the other
c81640	came up,
c81641	before which three of them fell—
c81642	the horn
c81643	with eyes and with
c81644	a mouth
c81645	that spoke words of arrogance.
c81646	whose appearance [was] more imposing than the others,
c81647	As I watched,
c81648	this horn was waging war against the saints
c81649	and prevailing against them,
c81650	until the Ancient of Days arrived
c81651	and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High,
c81652	and the time came
c81653	for [them] to possess the kingdom.
c81654	This is what he said:
c81655	‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on the earth,
c81656	different from all the other kingdoms,
c81657	and it will devour the whole earth,
c81658	trample it down,
c81659	and crush it.
c81660	And the ten horns ... from this kingdom.
c81661	[are] ten kings who will rise
c81662	After them another [king], ... will rise
c81663	different from the earlier [ones],
c81664	and subdue three kings.
c81665	He will speak out against the Most High
c81666	and oppress the saints of the Most High,
c81667	intending
c81668	to change the set times and laws,
c81669	and [the saints] will be given into his hand for a time, and times, and half a time.
c81670	But the court will convene,
c81671	and his dominion will be taken away
c81672	and completely destroyed
c81673	forever.
c81674	Then the sovereignty, dominion, and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven will be given to the people, the saints of the Most High.
c81675	His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom,
c81676	and all rulers will serve
c81677	and obey Him.’
c81678	Thus ends the matter.
c81679	As for me, Daniel,
c81680	my thoughts troubled me greatly,
c81681	and my face turned pale.
c81682	But I kept the matter to myself.”
c81683	In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel,
c81684	subsequent to the one that had appeared to me previously.
c81685	And in the vision I saw
c81686	was
c81688	myself in the citadel of Susa,
c81689	in the province of Elam.
c81690	I saw in the vision
c81691	that I ... beside the Ulai Canal.
c81692	Then I lifted my eyes
c81693	and saw
c81695	a ram ... standing beside the canal.
c81696	with two horns
c81697	The horns were long,
c81698	but one was longer than the other,
c81699	and the longer one grew up later.
c81700	I saw the ram
c81701	charging toward the west and the north and the south.
c81702	No animal could stand against him,
c81703	and there was no deliverance from his power.
c81704	He did as he pleased
c81705	and became great.
c81706	As I was contemplating all this,
c81707	suddenly a goat ... came out of the west, crossing the surface of the entire earth
c81708	without touching the ground.
c81710	with a prominent horn between his eyes
c81711	He came toward the two-horned ram
c81712	I had seen
c81713	standing beside the canal
c81714	and rushed at him with furious power.
c81715	I saw
c81716	him approach the ram
c81717	in a rage against him,
c81718	and he struck the ram
c81719	and shattered his two horns.
c81720	The ram was powerless
c81721	to stand against him,
c81722	and the goat threw him to the ground
c81723	and trampled him,
c81724	[and] no one could deliver the ram from his power.
c81725	Thus the goat became very great,
c81727	but at the height of his power,
c81728	his large horn was broken off,
c81729	and four prominent horns came up in its place, pointing toward the four winds of heaven.
c81730	From one of [these horns] a little horn emerged
c81731	and grew extensively toward the south and the east and toward the Beautiful Land.
c81732	It grew as high as the host of heaven,
c81733	and it cast down some of the host and [some] of the stars to the earth,
c81734	and trampled them.
c81735	It magnified itself, even to the Prince of the host;
c81736	it removed His daily sacrifice
c81737	and overthrew the place of His sanctuary.
c81738	And on account of rebellion, the host [and] the daily sacrifice were given over [to the horn],
c81739	and it flung truth to the ground
c81740	in whatever it did.
c81741	and prospered
c81742	Then I heard a holy one
c81743	speaking,
c81744	and another holy one said
c81745	to [him],
c81746	“How long [until the fulfillment of] the vision of the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation,
c81747	and the surrender
c81748	of the sanctuary and of the host to be trampled?”
c81749	He said to me,
c81750	“It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings;
c81751	then the sanctuary will be properly restored.”
c81753	While I, Daniel, was watching the vision
c81754	and trying to understand it,
c81755	there
c81756	stood before me one having the appearance of a man.
c81757	And I heard the voice of a man ... from between [the banks of] the Ulai:
c81758	calling
c81760	“Gabriel,
c81761	explain the vision to this man.”
c81762	As he came near to where I stood,
c81765	I was terrified
c81766	and fell facedown.
c81767	he said to me,
c81768	“understand
c81769	“Son of man,”
c81770	that the vision concerns the time of the end.”
c81772	While he was speaking to me,
c81773	I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground.
c81774	Then he touched me,
c81775	helped me to my feet
c81776	and said,
c81777	“Behold,
c81778	I will make known to you
c81779	what will happen in the latter time of wrath,
c81780	because it concerns the appointed time of the end.
c81781	ram
c81782	that you saw
c81783	The two-horned ... represents the kings of Media and Persia.
c81784	The shaggy goat represents the king of Greece,
c81785	and the large horn
c81786	between his eyes
c81787	is the first king.
c81788	the broken [one]
c81789	The four [horns] that replaced ... that will rise
c81790	represent four kingdoms ... from that nation,
c81791	but will not have the same power.
c81792	In the latter part of their reign,
c81793	when the rebellion has reached its full measure,
c81794	an insolent king, ... will come to the throne.
c81795	skilled in intrigue,
c81796	His power will be great,
c81797	but it will not be his own.
c81798	He will cause terrible destruction
c81799	and succeed
c81800	in whatever he does.
c81801	He will destroy the mighty men along with the holy people.
c81802	Through his craft
c81803	and by his hand, he will cause deceit to prosper,
c81804	and in his own mind he will make himself great.
c81805	In a time of peace he will destroy many,
c81806	and he will even stand against the Prince of princes.
c81807	Yet he will be broken off, but not by human hands.
c81808	The vision of the evenings and the mornings
c81809	that has been spoken
c81810	is true.
c81811	Now you must seal up the vision,
c81812	for it concerns the distant future.”
c81813	I, Daniel, was exhausted
c81814	and lay ill for days.
c81815	Then I got up
c81816	and went about the king’s business.
c81817	I was devastated by the vision;
c81818	it was beyond understanding.
c81819	In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes, a Mede by descent,
c81820	who was made ruler over the kingdom of the Chaldeans—
c81821	in the first year
c81822	of his reign,
c81823	I, Daniel, understood from the sacred books,
c81825	according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet,
c81826	that the desolation of Jerusalem would last
c81827	seventy years.
c81828	So I turned my attention to the Lord God
c81829	to seek Him by prayer and petition, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
c81830	And I prayed to the LORD my God
c81831	and confessed,
c81833	“O, Lord, the great and awesome God,
c81834	who keeps His covenant of loving devotion to those who love Him and keep His commandments,
c81835	we have sinned
c81836	and done wrong.
c81837	We have acted wickedly
c81838	and rebelled.
c81839	We have turned away from Your commandments and ordinances.
c81840	We have not listened to Your servants the prophets,
c81841	who spoke in Your name to our kings, leaders, fathers, and all the people of the land.
c81842	To You,
c81843	O Lord,
c81844	[belongs] righteousness,
c81845	we are covered with shame—
c81846	but this day ... the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, and all Israel,
c81847	near
c81848	and far,
c81849	in all the countries
c81850	to which You have driven us because of our unfaithfulness
c81851	to You.
c81852	O LORD,
c81853	we are covered with shame— our kings, our leaders, and our fathers—
c81854	because we have sinned against You.
c81855	To the Lord our God [belong] compassion and forgiveness,
c81856	even though we have rebelled against Him
c81857	and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God
c81858	to walk in His laws,
c81859	which He set before us through His servants the prophets.
c81860	All Israel has transgressed Your law
c81861	and turned away,
c81862	refusing to obey Your voice;
c81863	so the oath and the curse ... has been poured out on us
c81864	written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God,
c81865	because we have sinned against You.
c81866	You have carried out the words
c81867	spoken against us and against our rulers
c81869	by bringing upon us a great disaster.
c81870	For under all of heaven, nothing ... like what has been done
c81871	has ever been done ... to Jerusalem.
c81872	Just as it is written in the Law of Moses,
c81873	all this disaster
c81874	has come upon us,
c81875	yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God
c81876	by turning from our iniquities
c81877	and paying attention to Your truth.
c81878	Therefore the LORD has kept the calamity in store ... upon us.
c81879	and brought it ... in
c81880	For the LORD our God is righteous ... all
c81881	He does;
c81882	yet we have not obeyed His voice.
c81883	Now,
c81884	O Lord our God,
c81885	who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand,
c81886	and who made for Yourself a name renowned to this day,
c81887	we have sinned,
c81888	we have acted wickedly.
c81889	O Lord,
c81890	in keeping with all Your righteous acts, I pray that Your anger and wrath may turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy hill;
c81891	for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people [are] a reproach to all around us.
c81892	So now,
c81893	hear
c81894	our God,
c81895	the prayers and petitions of Your servant.
c81896	For Your sake, O Lord, cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate sanctuary.
c81897	Incline
c81898	O my God,
c81899	Your ear,
c81900	and hear;
c81901	open Your eyes
c81902	and see the desolation of the city
c81903	that bears Your name. ... because of
c81904	For we are not presenting our petitions before You ... our righteous acts, ... because of
c81905	but ... Your abundant compassion.
c81906	O Lord,
c81907	listen!
c81908	O Lord,
c81909	forgive!
c81910	O Lord,
c81911	hear
c81912	and act!
c81913	For Your sake, ... do not delay,
c81914	O my God,
c81915	because Your city and Your people bear Your name.”
c81916	While I was speaking,
c81917	praying,
c81918	confessing my sin and [that] of my people Israel,
c81919	and presenting my petition before the LORD my God concerning [His] holy hill—
c81920	while I was still praying,
c81921	Gabriel, the man
c81922	I had seen in the earlier vision,
c81923	in swift flight
c81924	came to me ... about the time of the evening sacrifice.
c81925	He instructed [me]
c81926	and spoke with me,
c81927	saying:
c81928	“O Daniel,
c81929	I have come now
c81930	to give you insight with understanding.
c81931	At the beginning of your petitions, an answer went out,
c81932	and I have come
c81933	to tell [you],
c81934	for you [are] highly precious.
c81935	So consider the message
c81936	and understand the vision:
c81937	Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city
c81938	to stop their transgression,
c81939	to put an end to sin, ... to seal up
c81940	to make atonement for iniquity,
c81941	to bring in everlasting righteousness,
c81942	vision and prophecy,
c81943	and to anoint the Most Holy Place.
c81944	Know
c81945	and understand this:
c81946	From the issuing of the decree
c81947	to restore
c81948	and rebuild Jerusalem,
c81949	until the Messiah, the Prince, there will be seven weeks
c81950	and sixty-two weeks. It will be rebuilt
c81951	with streets and a trench,
c81952	but in times of distress.
c81953	Then after the sixty-two weeks, the Messiah will be cut off
c81954	and will have nothing,
c81955	and the people of the prince ... will destroy the city and the sanctuary.
c81956	who is to come
c81957	The end will come like a flood,
c81958	and until the end there will be war; desolations have been decreed.
c81959	And he will confirm a covenant with many for one week,
c81960	but in the middle of the week he will put an end to sacrifice and offering.
c81961	And on the wing [of the temple] [will come] the abomination that causes desolation,
c81962	until ... destruction
c81963	the decreed ... is poured out upon [him].”
c81964	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel,
c81965	who was called Belteshazzar.
c81966	The message was true,
c81967	and it concerned a great conflict.
c81968	of the message was given to him
c81969	And the understanding ... in a vision.
c81970	In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three full weeks.
c81971	I ate no rich food,
c81972	no meat or wine entered my mouth,
c81973	and I did not anoint myself with oil
c81974	until the three weeks were completed.
c81975	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month,
c81976	as I was standing on the bank of the great river,
c81977	the Tigris,
c81978	I lifted up my eyes,
c81980	and behold,
c81981	there was a certain man
c81982	dressed in linen,
c81983	with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.
c81984	His body [was] like beryl,
c81985	his face like the brilliance of lightning,
c81986	his eyes like flaming torches,
c81987	his arms and legs like the gleam of polished bronze,
c81988	and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.
c81989	Only I, Daniel, saw the vision;
c81990	the men
c81991	with me
c81992	did not see it,
c81993	but a great terror fell upon them,
c81994	and they ran
c81995	and hid themselves.
c81996	So I was left alone,
c81997	gazing at this great vision.
c81998	No strength remained in me;
c81999	my face grew deathly pale,
c82000	and I was powerless.
c82001	I heard the sound of his words,
c82002	and as I listened,
c82003	I fell into a deep sleep, with my face
c82004	to the ground.
c82005	Suddenly,
c82006	a hand touched me
c82007	and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
c82008	He said to me,
c82009	“Daniel, you are a man who is highly precious.
c82010	Consider carefully the words
c82011	that I am about to say to you.
c82012	Stand up,
c82013	for I have now been sent to you.”
c82015	And when he had said this to me,
c82016	I stood up trembling.
c82017	he said,
c82018	“Do not be afraid,
c82019	Daniel,”
c82020	“for from the first day
c82021	that you purposed
c82022	to understand
c82023	and to humble yourself before your God,
c82024	your words were heard,
c82025	and I have come in response to them.
c82026	However, the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for twenty-one days.
c82028	Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came
c82029	to help me,
c82030	for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.
c82031	Now I have come
c82032	to explain to you
c82033	what will happen to your people in the latter days,
c82034	for the vision concerns those days.”
c82036	While he was speaking these words to me,
c82037	I set my face toward the ground
c82038	and became speechless.
c82039	And suddenly
c82040	[one] with the likeness of a man touched my lips,
c82041	and I opened my mouth
c82043	and said to the one standing before me,
c82044	“My lord,
c82045	because of the vision, I am overcome with anguish,
c82046	and I have no strength.
c82047	How can I, [your] servant,
c82048	speak with [you], my lord?
c82049	I
c82050	Now ... have no strength,
c82051	nor is any breath left in me.”
c82052	Again
c82053	[the one] with the likeness of a man touched me
c82054	and strengthened me.
c82055	he said.
c82056	“Do not be afraid,
c82057	you who are highly precious,”
c82058	“Peace [be] with you!
c82059	Be strong now,
c82060	be very strong!”
c82062	As he spoke to me,
c82063	I was strengthened
c82064	and said,
c82065	speak,
c82066	“May my lord
c82067	for you have strengthened me.”
c82068	he said.
c82069	“Do you know
c82070	why I have come to you?”
c82071	“I must return at once
c82072	to fight against the prince of Persia,
c82073	and when I have gone forth,
c82074	behold, the prince of Greece will come.
c82075	But first I will tell you
c82076	what is inscribed in the book of truth.
c82077	Yet no one
c82078	has the courage to support me against these,
c82079	except Michael, your prince.
c82080	And I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, stood up to strengthen and protect him.
c82081	Now then,
c82082	I will tell you the truth:
c82083	Three more kings will arise in Persia,
c82084	and then a fourth, who will be far richer [than the others]. ... everyone
c82085	By the power of his wealth, he will stir up ... against the kingdom of Greece.
c82086	Then a mighty king will arise,
c82087	who will rule with great authority
c82088	and do as he pleases.
c82090	But as soon as he is established,
c82091	his kingdom will be broken up
c82092	and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven.
c82093	It will not [go] to his descendants,
c82094	nor will it have the authority
c82095	with which he ruled,
c82096	because his kingdom will be uprooted
c82097	and [given] to others.
c82098	The king of the South will grow strong, but one of his commanders
c82099	will grow even stronger
c82100	and will rule
c82101	his own kingdom with great authority.
c82102	After some years they will form an alliance,
c82103	and the daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North
c82104	to seal the agreement.
c82105	But [his daughter] will not retain her position of power,
c82106	nor will ... endure.
c82107	his strength
c82108	At that time she will be given up, along with her royal escort and her father and the one who supported her.
c82109	But one from her family line will rise up in his place,
c82110	come against the army
c82111	of the king of the North, and enter his fortress,
c82112	fighting
c82113	and prevailing.
c82114	He will take even their gods captive to Egypt, with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold.
c82115	For some years he will stay away from the king of the North,
c82116	who will invade the realm of the king of the South
c82117	and then return to his own land.
c82118	But his sons will stir up strife
c82119	and assemble a great army,
c82120	which will advance forcefully,
c82121	like a flood,
c82122	sweeping through
c82123	and will again
c82124	carry the battle as far as his fortress.
c82125	In a rage, the king of the South
c82126	will march out
c82127	to fight the king of the North,
c82128	who will raise a large army,
c82129	but it will be given over to the hand of his [enemy].
c82130	When the army is carried off,
c82131	[the king of the South] will be proud in heart
c82132	and cast down tens of thousands,
c82133	but he will not triumph.
c82134	For the king of the North ... another
c82135	will raise ... army,
c82136	larger than the first,
c82137	and after some years he will advance with a great army and many supplies.
c82138	In those times many will rise up against the king of the South.
c82139	Violent ones among your own people will exalt themselves
c82140	in fulfillment of the vision,
c82141	but they will fail.
c82142	Then the king of the North will come,
c82143	build up a siege mound,
c82144	and capture a fortified city.
c82145	The forces of the South will not stand;
c82146	even their best troops
c82147	will not be able
c82148	to resist.
c82149	will do
c82150	The invader
c82151	as he pleases,
c82152	and no one will stand against him.
c82153	He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land,
c82154	with destruction in his hand.
c82155	He will resolve
c82156	to come with the strength of his whole kingdom,
c82157	and will reach an agreement with [the king of the South].
c82159	He will give him a daughter in marriage
c82160	in order to overthrow [the kingdom],
c82161	but [his plan] will not succeed
c82162	or help him.
c82163	Then he will turn his face to the coastlands
c82164	and capture many of them.
c82165	But a commander will put an end to his reproach
c82166	and will turn it back upon him.
c82167	After this, he will turn back his face to the fortresses of his own land,
c82168	but he will stumble
c82169	and fall
c82170	and be no more.
c82171	In his place one will arise
c82172	who will send out a tax collector for the glory of the kingdom;
c82173	but within a few days he will be destroyed,
c82174	though not in anger
c82175	or in battle.
c82176	In his place a despicable person will arise;
c82177	royal honors will not be given to him,
c82178	but he will come in a time of peace
c82179	and seize the kingdom by intrigue.
c82180	Then a flood of forces will be swept away before him
c82181	and destroyed,
c82182	along with a prince of the covenant.
c82184	After an alliance is made with him,
c82185	he will act deceitfully;
c82186	for he will rise
c82187	to power with only a few people.
c82188	In a time of peace,
c82189	he will invade the richest provinces
c82190	and do
c82191	what his fathers and forefathers never did.
c82192	He will lavish [on his followers] plunder, loot, and wealth,
c82193	and he will plot against the strongholds—
c82194	but only for a time.
c82195	And with a large army he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South,
c82196	[who] will mobilize a very large and powerful army
c82197	but will not withstand
c82198	the plots devised against him.
c82199	Those who eat from his provisions will seek to destroy him;
c82200	his army will be swept away,
c82201	and many will fall slain.
c82202	And the two kings,
c82203	with their hearts bent on evil,
c82204	will speak lies at the same table,
c82205	but to no avail,
c82206	for still the end will come at the appointed time.
c82207	The king of the North will return to his land with great wealth,
c82208	but his heart will be set against the holy covenant;
c82209	so he will do [damage]
c82210	and return to his own land.
c82211	At the appointed time ... again,
c82212	he will invade the South
c82213	but this time will not be like the first.
c82214	Ships of Kittim will come against him,
c82215	and he will lose heart.
c82216	Then he will turn back
c82217	and rage against the holy covenant
c82218	and do [damage].
c82219	So he will return
c82220	and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.
c82221	His forces will rise up
c82222	and desecrate the temple fortress.
c82223	They will abolish the daily sacrifice
c82224	and set up the abomination
c82225	of desolation.
c82226	With flattery he will corrupt those who violate the covenant,
c82227	but the people who know their God will firmly
c82228	resist [him].
c82229	Those with insight will instruct many,
c82230	though for a time they will fall by sword and flame or be captured or plundered.
c82232	Now when they fall,
c82233	they will be granted a little help,
c82234	but many will join them insincerely.
c82235	Some of the wise will fall,
c82236	so that they may be refined,
c82237	purified,
c82238	and made spotless
c82239	until the time of the end,
c82240	for it will still come at the appointed time.
c82241	Then the king will do as he pleases
c82242	and will exalt
c82243	and magnify himself above every god,
c82244	and he will speak monstrous things against the God of gods.
c82245	He will be successful
c82246	until the time of wrath is completed,
c82247	for what has been decreed must be accomplished.
c82248	He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers,
c82249	nor for the one desired by women, nor for
c82250	any other god, ... himself above
c82251	because he will magnify ... [them] all.
c82252	And in their place, he will honor a god of fortresses—
c82253	a god
c82254	his fathers did not know—
c82255	with gold, silver, precious stones, and riches.
c82256	He will attack the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god
c82257	those who acknowledge him,
c82258	and will greatly honor
c82259	making them rulers over many
c82260	and distributing land for a price.
c82261	At the time of the end, the king of the South will engage him in battle,
c82262	but the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots, horsemen, and many ships,
c82263	invading [many] countries
c82264	like a flood.
c82265	and sweeping through them
c82266	He will also invade the Beautiful Land,
c82267	and many [countries] will fall.
c82268	But these will be delivered from his hand:
c82269	Edom, Moab, and the leaders of the Ammonites.
c82270	He will extend his power over [many] countries,
c82271	and not even the land of Egypt will escape.
c82272	He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and over all the riches of Egypt,
c82273	and the Libyans and Cushites will also submit to him.
c82274	But news from the east and the north will alarm him,
c82275	and he will go out with great fury
c82276	to destroy
c82277	and annihilate many.
c82278	He will pitch his royal tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain,
c82279	but he will meet his end
c82280	with no one to help him.
c82281	At that time Michael, the great prince who stands watch
c82282	over your people, will rise up.
c82283	There will be a time of distress
c82284	such as never has occurred
c82285	from the beginning of nations
c82286	until then.
c82287	But at that time your people— everyone [whose name] ... will be delivered.
c82288	is found
c82289	written in the book—
c82290	And many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake,
c82291	some to everlasting life,
c82292	but others to shame [and] everlasting contempt.
c82293	Then the wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens,
c82294	and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.
c82295	But you,
c82296	Daniel,
c82297	shut up these words
c82298	and seal the book until the time of the end.
c82299	Many will roam to and fro,
c82300	and knowledge will increase.”
c82301	Then I, Daniel, looked
c82302	and saw
c82303	two others standing
c82304	there, one on this bank of the river
c82305	and one on the opposite bank.
c82306	One of them said to the man dressed in linen,
c82307	who was above the waters of the river,
c82308	“How long until the fulfillment of these wonders?”
c82309	And the man dressed in linen, ... and I heard
c82310	who was above the waters of the river,
c82311	raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven,
c82312	him swear by Him who lives forever,
c82313	saying, “It will be for a time, times, and half a time.
c82315	things will be completed.”
c82316	When the power of the holy people has been shattered,
c82317	all these
c82318	I heard,
c82319	but I did not understand.
c82320	So I asked,
c82321	“My lord,
c82322	what will be the outcome of these [things]?”
c82323	he replied,
c82324	“Go on your way,
c82325	Daniel,”
c82326	“for ... [are] closed up
c82327	the words ... and sealed until the time of the end.
c82328	will be purified,
c82329	made spotless,
c82330	Many ... and refined,
c82331	but the wicked will continue to act wickedly.
c82332	None of the wicked will understand,
c82333	but the wise will understand.
c82334	And from the time
c82335	the daily [sacrifice] is abolished
c82336	and the abomination of desolation set up,
c82337	there will be 1,290 days.
c82338	Blessed [is]
c82339	he who waits
c82340	and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.
c82341	But as for you, go on your way until the end.
c82342	You will rest,
c82343	and will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days.”
c82344	In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia,
c82345	to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah,
c82346	the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia
c82347	to send a proclamation throughout his kingdom
c82348	and to put it in writing
c82349	as follows:
c82350	“This is what Cyrus king of Persia says:
c82351	‘The LORD, the God of heaven, ... has given me all the kingdoms of the earth,
c82352	who ... has appointed me
c82353	to build a house for Him at Jerusalem
c82354	in Judah.
c82355	Whoever among you belongs to His people,
c82356	may his God be with him,
c82357	and may he go to Jerusalem
c82358	in Judah ... who
c82359	and build the house of the LORD, the God of Israel;
c82360	He [is] the God
c82361	is in Jerusalem.
c82362	And let every
c82363	survivor, wherever
c82364	he lives,
c82365	be assisted by the men of that region with silver, gold, goods, and livestock, along with a freewill offering for the house of God
c82366	in Jerusalem.’”
c82367	So the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites— everyone ... prepared
c82368	whose spirit God had stirred—
c82369	to go up
c82370	and rebuild the house of the LORD
c82371	in Jerusalem.
c82372	And all their neighbors supported them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuables, in addition to all
c82373	their freewill offerings.
c82374	King Cyrus also brought out the articles belonging to the house of the LORD
c82375	that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem
c82376	and placed in the temple of his gods.
c82377	Cyrus king of Persia had them brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer,
c82378	who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
c82379	This was the inventory:
c82380	30 gold basins,
c82381	1,000 silver basins,
c82382	29 silver utensils,
c82383	30 gold bowls,
c82384	410 matching silver bowls,
c82385	and 1,000 other articles.
c82386	In all, there were 5,400 gold and silver articles.
c82387	Sheshbazzar brought all [these]
c82388	along when the exiles went up from Babylon to Jerusalem.

c82454	the descendants of Shephatiah, the descendants of Hattil, the descendants of Pochereth-hazzebaim, and the descendants of Ami.
c82455	The temple servants and descendants of the servants of Solomon [numbered] 392 in all.
c82456	The following
c82457	came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer,
c82458	but could not
c82459	prove
c82460	that their families were descended
c82461	from Israel:
c82462	the descendants of Delaiah, the descendants of Tobiah and the descendants of Nekoda, 652[in all].
c82463	And from among the priests: the descendants of Habaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, and the descendants of Barzillai
c82464	(who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite
c82465	and was called by their name).
c82466	These [men] searched for their family records,
c82468	but they could not find them
c82469	and so were excluded from the priesthood {as unclean}.
c82470	The governor ordered
c82471	them not to eat the most holy things
c82472	until there was a priest to consult the Urim and Thummim.
c82473	The whole assembly [numbered] 42,360,
c82474	in addition to their 7,337 menservants and maidservants,
c82475	as well as their 200 male and female singers.
c82476	They had 736 horses,
c82477	245 mules,
c82478	435 camels,
c82479	and 6,720 donkeys.
c82480	[some] of the heads of the families
c82481	When they arrived at the house of the LORD
c82482	in Jerusalem,
c82483	gave freewill offerings ... the house of God
c82484	to rebuild ... on its original site.
c82485	According to their ability, they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 darics of gold, 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 priestly garments.
c82486	So the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants, along with some of the people, settled in their own towns;
c82487	and the rest of the Israelites settled [in their towns].
c82488	By the seventh month, ... had settled
c82489	the Israelites ... in their towns,
c82490	and the people assembled as one man in Jerusalem.
c82491	Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests, along with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his associates, began
c82492	to build the altar of the God of Israel
c82493	to sacrifice burnt offerings on it,
c82494	as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God.
c82495	They set up the altar on its foundation
c82496	upon it ... even though they feared the people of the land.
c82497	and sacrificed burnt offerings ... to the LORD—
c82498	[both] the morning and evening burnt offerings—
c82499	They also celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles, as [it is] written,
c82500	and offered burnt offerings daily, based on the number prescribed for each day.
c82501	After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings
c82502	and [those] for New Moons and for all the appointed sacred feasts of the LORD,
c82503	as well as all
c82504	the freewill offerings brought to the LORD.
c82505	On the first day of the seventh month, [the Israelites] began
c82506	to offer burnt offerings to the LORD,
c82507	{although the foundation} of the temple of the LORD had not been laid.
c82508	They gave money to the masons and carpenters,
c82509	and food and drink and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre
c82510	to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to Joppa by sea, as authorized by King Cyrus of Persia.
c82511	In the second ... year
c82512	after they had arrived at the house of God in Jerusalem,
c82513	month of the second ... Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak, and the rest of their associates including the priests, the Levites, and all ... began [the work].
c82514	who had returned to Jerusalem from the captivity,
c82515	They appointed Levites twenty years of age or older
c82516	to supervise the construction of the house of the LORD.
c82517	Jeshua and his sons and brothers joined together with Kadmiel and his sons, the descendants of Yehudah,
c82518	to supervise
c82519	those working on the house of God.
c82520	[and with] the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers— all Levites—
c82521	When the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD,
c82522	the priests ... took their positions
c82523	in their apparel
c82524	with trumpets,
c82525	and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with cymbals,
c82526	to praise the LORD, as King David of Israel had prescribed.
c82527	And they sang responsively
c82528	with praise
c82529	and thanksgiving to the LORD:
c82530	“For He is good;
c82531	for His loving devotion upon Israel endures forever.”
c82532	Then all the people gave a great shout
c82533	of praise to the LORD,
c82534	because {the foundation} of the house of the LORD had been laid.
c82535	But many of the older priests, Levites, and family heads
c82536	who had seen the first temple ... the foundation
c82537	when they saw ... of this temple.
c82538	wept loudly
c82539	Still, many others shouted
c82540	joyfully.
c82541	The people could not distinguish the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, ... the people
c82542	because ... were making so much noise.
c82543	And the sound was heard from afar.
c82544	When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard
c82545	that the exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel,
c82546	they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families,
c82547	saying,
c82548	“Let us build with you
c82549	because, like you, we seek your God
c82550	and have been sacrificing to Him since the time of King Esar-haddon of Assyria,
c82551	who brought us here.”
c82552	But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other heads of the families of Israel replied,
c82553	“You have no part with us
c82554	in building a house for our God,
c82555	since we alone must build it for the LORD, the God of Israel,
c82556	as Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.”
c82557	Then the people of the land
c82558	set out to discourage the people of Judah
c82559	and make them afraid
c82560	to build.
c82561	They hired counselors against them
c82562	to frustrate their plans
c82563	throughout the reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia.
c82564	At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, an accusation was lodged against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
c82565	And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his associates wrote [a letter] to Artaxerxes.
c82566	[It] was written in Aramaic
c82567	and translated [for the king]. The Aramaic script [read as follows]:
c82568	Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows:
c82569	From Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates— the judges and officials over Tripolis, Persia, Erech and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa,
c82570	and the rest of the peoples
c82571	whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal relocated
c82572	and settled in the cities of Samaria and elsewhere west of the Euphrates.
c82574	(This is the text of the letter
c82575	they sent to him.)
c82576	To King Artaxerxes, From your servants, the men west of the Euphrates:
c82578	Let it be known to the king
c82579	that the Jews
c82580	who came from you
c82581	have returned to us at Jerusalem.
c82582	And they are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city,
c82583	restoring its walls,
c82584	and repairing its foundations.
c82585	Let it now be known to the king
c82586	that
c82587	if that city is rebuilt
c82588	and its walls are restored,
c82589	they will not pay tribute, duty, or toll,
c82590	and the royal treasury will suffer.
c82591	Now
c82592	because we are in the service of the palace
c82593	the king to be dishonored,
c82594	and it is not fitting for us
c82595	to allow
c82596	we have sent
c82597	to inform the king
c82598	that a search should be made of the record books of your fathers.
c82599	[In these] books you will discover
c82600	and verify
c82601	that the city is a rebellious city, ... this
c82602	harmful to kings and provinces,
c82603	inciting sedition from ancient times.
c82604	That is why ... city was destroyed.
c82605	We advise the king
c82606	that
c82607	if this city is rebuilt
c82608	and its walls are restored,
c82609	you will have no dominion west of the Euphrates.
c82610	[Then] the king sent this reply:
c82611	To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of your associates
c82612	living in Samaria
c82613	and elsewhere in the region west of the Euphrates:
c82614	Greetings.
c82616	The letter
c82617	you sent us
c82618	has been translated and read in my presence.
c82619	I issued a decree,
c82620	and a search was conducted.
c82621	It was discovered
c82622	that this city has revolted against kings from ancient times,
c82623	engaging in rebellion and sedition.
c82624	And mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem
c82625	and exercised authority over the whole region west of the Euphrates,
c82626	and tribute, duty, and toll were paid to them.
c82627	Now, therefore, issue an order
c82628	for these men to stop,
c82629	so that this city will not be rebuilt
c82630	until I so order.
c82631	See that you
c82632	do not neglect this matter.
c82633	Why allow this threat to increase
c82634	and the royal interests to suffer?
c82635	When
c82636	the text of the letter from King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates,
c82637	they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem
c82638	and forcibly stopped them.
c82639	Thus the construction of the house of God ... ceased,
c82640	in Jerusalem
c82641	and it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.
c82642	Later, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews
c82643	in Judah and Jerusalem
c82644	in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them.
c82645	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak rose up
c82646	and began
c82647	to rebuild the house of God
c82648	in Jerusalem. ... of
c82649	And the prophets ... God were with them,
c82650	helping them.
c82651	At that time Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates went to
c82652	the Jews and asked,
c82653	“Who authorized you
c82654	to rebuild this temple
c82655	and restore this structure?”
c82656	They also asked,
c82657	“What are the names of the men
c82658	who are constructing this building?”
c82659	But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews,
c82660	so that they were not stopped
c82661	until a report was sent to Darius
c82662	and written instructions about this matter were returned.
c82663	This is the text of the letter
c82664	that Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates, the officials ... sent
c82665	in the region,
c82666	to King Darius.
c82667	The report they sent him
c82668	read as follows:
c82669	To King Darius: All peace.
c82670	Let it be known to the king
c82671	that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God.
c82672	[The people] are rebuilding it with large stones,
c82673	and placing timbers in the walls.
c82674	This work is being carried out diligently
c82675	and is prospering in their hands.
c82676	So we questioned the elders
c82677	and asked,
c82678	“Who authorized you
c82679	to rebuild this temple
c82680	and restore this structure?”
c82681	We also asked for their names,
c82682	for your information.
c82683	so that we could write down the names of their leaders
c82685	And this is the answer they returned:
c82687	“We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, ... that
c82688	and we are rebuilding the temple
c82689	was built many years ago,
c82690	which a great king of Israel built
c82691	and completed.
c82692	But
c82693	since our fathers angered the God of heaven,
c82694	He handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean
c82695	this temple
c82696	who destroyed
c82697	and carried away the people to Babylon.
c82698	However, in his first year, Cyrus king of Babylon issued a decree
c82699	to rebuild this house of God.
c82700	He also ... articles belonging to the house of God,
c82701	the gold and silver ... which
c82702	Nebuchadnezzar had taken ... from the temple
c82703	in Jerusalem.
c82704	and carried [there]
c82706	removed from the temple ... King Cyrus
c82707	of Babylon
c82708	gave [these articles] to a man named Sheshbazzar,
c82709	whom he appointed governor
c82710	and instructed,
c82711	‘Take these articles,
c82713	put them in the temple
c82714	in Jerusalem,
c82715	and let the house of God be rebuilt on its original site.’
c82716	So this Sheshbazzar came
c82717	and laid the foundation of the house of God
c82718	in Jerusalem,
c82719	and from that time until now it has been under construction,
c82720	but is not yet completed.”
c82721	Now, therefore,
c82722	if it pleases the king,
c82723	let a search be made of the royal archives
c82724	in Babylon ... did indeed
c82725	to see if
c82726	King Cyrus ... issue a decree
c82727	to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem.
c82728	Then let the king send us his decision in this [matter].
c82729	Thus King Darius ordered
c82730	a search of the archives
c82731	stored in the treasury of Babylon.
c82732	was found in the fortress of Ecbatana,
c82733	in the province of Media,
c82734	And a scroll
c82735	with the following written on it:
c82736	Memorandum:
c82737	In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued a decree [concerning]
c82738	the house of God in Jerusalem:
c82739	Let the house be rebuilt as a place
c82740	for offering sacrifices,
c82741	and let its foundations be firmly laid.
c82742	It is to be sixty cubits high
c82743	[and] sixty cubits wide,
c82744	layers
c82745	of cut stones
c82746	with three
c82747	and one of timbers.
c82748	The costs are to be paid from the royal treasury.
c82749	Furthermore, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which ... must also
c82750	Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple
c82751	in Jerusalem
c82752	and carried to Babylon,
c82753	be returned
c82754	to the temple
c82755	in Jerusalem
c82757	and deposited in the house of God.
c82758	Therefore [Darius decreed]:
c82759	To Tattenai governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates and officials
c82760	in the region:
c82761	You must stay away from that place!
c82762	Leave the work on the house of God alone.
c82763	Let the governor and elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its original site.
c82764	I hereby decree what
c82765	you must do for these elders of the Jews
c82766	who are rebuilding this house of God:
c82767	The cost is to be paid in full to these men from the royal treasury out of the taxes of [the provinces] west of the Euphrates,
c82768	so that the work will not
c82769	be hindered.
c82770	Whatever is needed—
c82771	young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, as well as wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as requested by the priests
c82772	in Jerusalem—
c82773	must be given to them day by day
c82774	without fail.
c82775	Then they will be able to offer sacrifices of a sweet aroma to the God of heaven
c82776	and to pray for the lives of the king and his sons.
c82777	I also decree ... from
c82778	that if any man
c82779	interferes with this directive,
c82780	a beam is to be torn ... his house
c82781	and raised up,
c82782	and he is to be impaled on it.
c82783	And his own house shall be made a pile of rubble for this offense.
c82784	May God,
c82785	who has caused His name to dwell there,
c82786	overthrow any king or people
c82787	who lifts a hand
c82788	to alter [this decree]
c82789	or to destroy this house of God
c82790	in Jerusalem.
c82791	I, Darius, have issued the decree.
c82792	Let it be carried out with diligence.
c82793	In response, Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates
c82794	what King Darius had decreed.
c82795	diligently carried out
c82796	So the Jewish elders built
c82797	and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo.
c82798	building
c82799	They finished ... according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.
c82800	And this temple was completed on the third day of the month of Adar,
c82801	in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
c82802	Then the people of Israel— the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the exiles— celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy.
c82803	For the dedication of the house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs,
c82804	and a sin offering for all Israel of twelve male goats, one for each tribe of Israel.
c82805	They also appointed the priests by their divisions
c82806	and the Levites by their groups to the service of God
c82807	in Jerusalem,
c82808	according to what is written in the book of Moses.
c82809	On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles kept the Passover.
c82810	the priests and Levites had purified themselves
c82811	All ... and were ceremonially clean.
c82812	And [the Levites] slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their priestly brothers, and for themselves.
c82813	The Israelites ... ate it,
c82814	who had returned from exile
c82815	together with all
c82816	who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the Gentiles of the land,
c82817	in order to seek the LORD, the God of Israel.
c82818	For seven days they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread with joy,
c82819	because the LORD had made them joyful
c82820	and turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them
c82821	to strengthen their hands in the work on the house of the God of Israel.
c82822	Many years later, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
c82823	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
c82824	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
c82825	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
c82826	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest—
c82827	this Ezra came up from Babylon.
c82828	He [was] a scribe skilled in the law of Moses,
c82829	which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given.
c82830	The king had granted [Ezra] all his requests, for the hand of the LORD his God was upon him.
c82831	So in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes, he went up to Jerusalem with some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants.
c82832	Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month
c82833	of the seventh year of the king.
c82834	He had begun the journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month,
c82835	and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the gracious hand of his God was on him.
c82836	For Ezra had set his heart
c82837	to study the law of the LORD,
c82838	to practice it,
c82839	and to teach its statutes and ordinances in Israel.
c82840	This is the text of the letter
c82841	King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest and scribe, a man learned in the commandments and statutes of the LORD to Israel:
c82842	Artaxerxes, king of kings. To Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven:
c82843	Greetings.
c82845	I hereby decree
c82846	that any volunteers among the Israelites in my kingdom, including the priests and Levites,
c82847	to Jerusalem.
c82848	may go up with you
c82849	You are sent by the king and his seven counselors ... which
c82850	to evaluate Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God,
c82851	is in your hand.
c82852	Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold
c82853	that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose
c82854	dwelling is in Jerusalem,
c82855	together with all the silver and gold
c82856	you may find in all the province of Babylon,
c82857	as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests
c82858	to the house of their God
c82859	in Jerusalem.
c82860	With this money, therefore, you are to buy as many bulls, rams, and lambs as needed, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings,
c82861	and offer them on the altar at the house of your God
c82862	in Jerusalem.
c82863	whatever
c82864	You and your brothers ... seems best
c82865	may do ... with the rest of the silver and gold,
c82866	according to the will of your God.
c82867	all the articles
c82868	the God ... given to you for the service of the house
c82869	You must deliver to ... of Jerusalem ... of your God.
c82870	And if anything else is needed for the house of your God
c82871	that you may have occasion
c82872	to supply,
c82873	you may pay [for it] from the royal treasury.
c82874	I, King Artaxerxes, decree to all the treasurers
c82875	west of the Euphrates:
c82876	Whatever ... of
c82877	Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law ... the God of heaven, may require of you,
c82878	it must be provided promptly,
c82879	up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred cors of wheat, a hundred baths of wine, a hundred baths of olive oil, and salt without limit.
c82880	Whatever
c82881	is commanded by the God of heaven
c82882	must be done diligently for the [His] house.
c82883	For why should wrath fall on the realm of the king and his sons?
c82884	And be advised
c82885	that ... any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, temple servants, or other servants of this house of God.
c82886	tribute, duty, or toll
c82887	you have no authority
c82888	to impose ... on
c82889	And you,
c82890	Ezra,
c82891	according to the wisdom of your God
c82892	which you possess,
c82893	are to appoint magistrates and judges
c82894	to judge all the people ... to anyone who
c82895	west of the Euphrates—
c82896	all
c82897	who know the laws of your God.
c82898	And you are to teach [these laws] ... does not
c82899	know them.
c82900	If anyone
c82901	does not keep the law of your God and the law of the king, ... be
c82902	let a strict judgment ... executed against him,
c82903	whether death,
c82904	banishment,
c82905	confiscation of property, or imprisonment.
c82906	Blessed [be] the LORD, the God of our fathers,
c82907	who has put into the heart of the king
c82908	to so honor the house of the LORD
c82909	in Jerusalem,
c82910	and who has shown me favor before the king, his counselors, and all his powerful officials.
c82911	And because the hand of the LORD my God [was] upon me, I took courage
c82912	and gathered the leaders of Israel
c82913	to return with me.
c82914	These are the family heads
c82915	and genealogical records
c82916	of those who returned with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
c82917	from the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom;
c82918	from the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel;
c82919	from the descendants of David, Hattush
c82920	of the descendants of Shechaniah; from the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah,
c82921	and with him [were] registered 150 men;
c82922	from the descendants of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah,
c82923	and with him 200 men;
c82924	from the descendants [of Zattu], Shechaniah son of Jahaziel,
c82925	and with him 300 men;
c82926	from the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan,
c82927	and with him 50 men;
c82928	from the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah,
c82929	and with him 70 men;
c82930	from the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael,
c82931	and with him 80 men;
c82932	from the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel,
c82933	and with him 218 men;
c82934	from the descendants [of Bani], Shelomith son of Josiphiah,
c82935	and with him 160 men;
c82936	from the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai,
c82937	and with him 28 men;
c82938	from the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan,
c82939	and with him 110 men;
c82940	from the later descendants of Adonikam,
c82941	these [were] their names:
c82942	Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah,
c82943	and with them 60 men;
c82944	and from the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai, and Zaccur,
c82945	and with them 70 men.
c82946	Now I assembled [these exiles] at the canal
c82947	that flows to Ahava,
c82948	and we camped there three days.
c82949	And when I searched among the people and priests,
c82950	I found no Levites there.
c82951	Then I summoned the leaders: Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, as well as the teachers Joiarib and Elnathan.
c82952	And I sent them to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia,
c82953	with a message
c82954	for him and his kinsmen, the temple servants at Casiphia,
c82955	that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.
c82956	And since the gracious hand of our God was upon us, they brought us ... a man of insight from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel—
c82957	Sherebiah— ... along with his sons and brothers,
c82958	18 men;
c82959	also Hashabiah,
c82960	together with Jeshaiah, from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and their sons,
c82961	20men.
c82962	of the temple servants.
c82963	(David and the officials had appointed ... to assist the Levites.)
c82964	[They also brought] 220 ... the temple servants
c82965	All of them were designated by name.
c82966	And there by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast,
c82967	so that we might humble ourselves before our God
c82968	and ask Him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.
c82969	For I was ashamed
c82970	to ask the king for an [escort of] soldiers and horsemen
c82971	to protect us from our enemies on the road,
c82972	since we had told him,
c82974	“The hand of our God is gracious to all who seek Him,
c82975	but His great anger is against all who forsake Him.”
c82976	So we fasted
c82977	and petitioned our God about this,
c82978	and He granted our request.
c82979	Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah,
c82980	and ten of their brothers,
c82981	and I weighed out to them the contribution of silver and gold and the articles ... for the house of our God.
c82982	that the king, his counselors, his leaders, and all the Israelites ... had offered
c82983	there
c82984	I weighed out into their hands 650 talents of silver, silver articles [weighing] 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,
c82985	20 gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and two articles of fine polished bronze, as precious as gold.
c82986	Then I told them,
c82987	“You are holy to the LORD,
c82988	and these articles [are] holy.
c82989	The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.
c82990	Guard
c82991	them carefully
c82992	until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem before the leading priests, Levites, and heads of the Israelite families.”
c82993	So the priests and Levites took charge of the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out
c82994	to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
c82995	On the twelfth day of the first month, we set out from the Ahava Canal
c82996	to go to Jerusalem,
c82997	and the hand of our God was upon us
c82998	to protect us from the hands of the enemies and bandits along the way.
c82999	So we arrived at Jerusalem
c83000	and rested there for three days.
c83001	On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and sacred articles into the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest.
c83002	Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him,
c83003	along with the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.
c83004	Everything was verified by number and weight,
c83005	and the total weight was recorded at that time.
c83006	who had returned from captivity
c83007	Then the exiles
c83008	sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, and a sin offering of 12 male goats.
c83009	All [this was] a burnt offering to the LORD.
c83010	They also delivered the king’s edicts to the royal satraps and governors of the region west of the Euphrates,
c83011	who proceeded to assist the people and the house of God.
c83013	After these things had been accomplished,
c83014	the leaders approached me
c83015	and said:
c83016	“The people of Israel, including the priests and Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the surrounding peoples whose abominations are like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.
c83017	Indeed, the Israelites have taken some of their daughters [as wives] for themselves and their sons,
c83018	so that the holy seed has been mixed with the people of the land.
c83019	And the leaders and officials have taken the lead in this unfaithfulness!”
c83021	When I heard this report,
c83022	I tore my tunic and cloak,
c83023	pulled out some hair from my head and beard,
c83024	and sat down in horror.
c83025	Then everyone ... gathered around me
c83026	who trembled at the words of the God of Israel ... because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles,
c83027	while I sat there in horror until the evening offering.
c83028	At the evening offering, I got up from my humiliation
c83029	with my tunic and cloak torn,
c83030	and I fell on my knees,
c83031	spread out my hands to the LORD my God,
c83032	and said:
c83033	“O my God,
c83034	I am ashamed
c83035	and embarrassed
c83036	to lift up
c83037	my God,
c83038	my face to You,
c83039	because our iniquities are higher than our heads,
c83040	and our guilt has reached the heavens.
c83041	From the days of our fathers to this day, our guilt has been great.
c83042	Because of our iniquities, we and our kings [and] our priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the earth and put to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation,
c83043	as we are this day.
c83044	But now,
c83045	for a brief moment, grace has come from the LORD our God
c83046	to preserve for us a remnant
c83047	and to give us a stake in His holy place.
c83048	our God ... and light to our eyes.
c83049	Even in our bondage, ... has given us new life
c83050	Though we are slaves,
c83051	our God has not forsaken us in our bondage,
c83052	but He has extended to us grace in the sight of the kings of Persia,
c83053	giving us new life
c83054	to rebuild the house of our God
c83055	and repair its ruins,
c83056	and giving us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
c83057	And now,
c83058	what can we say
c83059	our God,
c83060	after this?
c83061	For we have forsaken the commandments
c83062	that You gave through Your servants the prophets,
c83063	saying:
c83064	‘The land
c83065	you are entering
c83066	to possess
c83067	is a land polluted by the impurity of its peoples and the abominations
c83068	with which they have filled it from end to end.
c83069	Now, therefore,
c83070	do not give your daughters {in marriage} to their sons
c83071	or take their daughters for your sons.
c83072	Never seek their peace or prosperity,
c83073	so that you may be strong
c83074	and may eat the good things of the land,
c83075	leaving it as an inheritance to your sons forever.’
c83076	After all
c83077	that has come upon us because of our evil deeds and our great guilt
c83078	(though You,
c83079	our God,
c83080	have punished us less than our iniquities [deserve]
c83081	and have given us [such] a remnant as this)
c83082	shall we again
c83083	break Your commandments
c83084	and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations?
c83085	Would You not become so angry with us
c83086	as to wipe us out, leaving no remnant or survivor?
c83087	O LORD, God of Israel,
c83088	You are righteous!
c83089	For we remain ... as a remnant.
c83090	this day
c83091	Here we [are] before You in our guilt,
c83092	though ... no one
c83093	because of it ... can stand before You.”
c83095	While Ezra prayed
c83096	and confessed,
c83097	weeping
c83098	and falling facedown before the house of God,
c83099	a very large assembly of Israelites— men, women, and children— gathered around him,
c83100	and the people wept bitterly as well.
c83101	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, an Elamite, said
c83102	to Ezra:
c83103	“We have been unfaithful to our God
c83104	by marrying foreign women from the people of the land,
c83105	yet
c83106	in spite of this, there is hope for Israel.
c83107	So now
c83108	let us make a covenant before our God
c83109	to send away all the foreign wives
c83110	and their children,
c83111	according to the counsel of my lord
c83112	and of those who tremble at the command of our God.
c83113	Let it be done according to the Law.
c83114	Get up,
c83115	for [this] matter [is] your [responsibility],
c83116	and we will support you.
c83117	Be strong
c83118	and take action!”
c83119	So Ezra got up
c83120	and made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel take an oath
c83121	to do what had been said.
c83122	And they took the oath.
c83123	Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God
c83124	and walked to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib.
c83125	And while he stayed there,
c83126	he ate no food
c83127	and drank no water,
c83128	because he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
c83129	And a proclamation was issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles
c83130	should gather at Jerusalem.
c83131	Whoever
c83132	failed to appear within three days ... according to the counsel of the leaders and elders,
c83133	would forfeit all his property,
c83134	and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
c83135	So within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled in Jerusalem,
c83136	of the ninth month,
c83137	and on the twentieth day
c83138	all the people sat in the square at the house of God,
c83139	trembling regarding this matter and because of the heavy rain.
c83140	Then Ezra the priest stood up
c83141	and said to them,
c83142	“You have been unfaithful
c83143	by marrying foreign women,
c83144	adding to the guilt of Israel.
c83145	Now, therefore,
c83146	make a confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers,
c83147	and do His will.
c83148	Separate yourselves from the people of the land and from your foreign wives.”
c83149	And the whole assembly responded
c83150	in a loud voice:
c83151	“Truly ... as you say!
c83152	we will do
c83153	But there are many people here,
c83154	and it is the rainy season.
c83155	We are not able
c83156	to stay out in the open.
c83157	Nor [is this] the work of one ... days,
c83158	or two
c83159	for ... greatly
c83160	we have transgressed ... in this matter.
c83161	Let our leaders represent the whole assembly.
c83162	Then let everyone
c83163	in our towns
c83164	who has married a foreign woman
c83165	come at an appointed time,
c83166	together with the elders and judges of each town,
c83167	until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.”
c83168	(Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, ... opposed this [plan].)
c83169	supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite,
c83170	So the exiles did as proposed.
c83171	Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, ... to represent their families.
c83172	each of them identified by name,
c83173	On the first day of the tenth month
c83174	they convened the investigation,
c83175	they had dealt with all the men
c83176	who had married foreign women.
c83177	and by the first day of the first month
c83178	Among the descendants of the priests ... were found
c83179	who had married foreign women
c83180	these descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
c83181	They pledged
c83182	to send their wives away,
c83183	and for their guilt [they presented] a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.
c83184	From the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
c83185	From the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.
c83186	From the descendants of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
c83187	Among the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah
c83188	(that is Kelita),
c83189	Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
c83190	From the singers: Eliashib.
c83191	From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
c83192	And among the other Israelites, from the descendants of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah.
c83193	From the descendants of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah.
c83194	From the descendants of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza.
c83195	From the descendants of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
c83196	From the descendants of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth.
c83197	From the descendants of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh.
c83198	From the descendants of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
c83199	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
c83200	From the descendants of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
c83201	From the descendants of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,
c83202	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,
c83203	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
c83204	Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu.
c83205	From the descendants of Binnui: Shimei,
c83206	Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,
c83207	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
c83208	Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
c83209	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.
c83210	From the descendants of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.
c83211	All these [men] had married foreign women,
c83212	and [some] of them ... by these wives.
c83213	had children
c83214	[These are] the words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:
c83215	In the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year,
c83216	while I was in the citadel of Susa,
c83217	Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived
c83218	with men from Judah.
c83219	So I questioned them about the remnant of the Jews
c83220	who had survived the exile,
c83221	and also about Jerusalem.
c83222	And they told me,
c83223	“The remnant
c83224	who survived the exile [are] there in the province,
c83225	in great trouble and disgrace.
c83226	The wall of Jerusalem [is] broken down,
c83227	and its gates [are burned] with fire.”
c83229	When I heard these words,
c83230	I sat down
c83231	and wept.
c83232	I mourned for days,
c83233	fasting
c83234	and praying before the God of heaven.
c83235	Then I said:
c83236	“I pray, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God
c83237	who keeps His covenant of loving devotion with those who love Him and keep His commandments,
c83238	be ... and Your ears be attentive
c83239	may Your eyes ... open
c83240	to hear the prayer ... Your servant,
c83241	that I, ... now pray before You day and night for Your servants, the Israelites.
c83242	I confess the sins we Israelites
c83243	have committed against You.
c83244	Both I and my father’s house have sinned.
c83245	We have behaved corruptly against You
c83246	and have not kept the commandments, statutes, and ordinances
c83247	that You gave Your servant Moses.
c83248	Remember, I pray, the word
c83249	that You commanded Your servant Moses
c83250	when You said,
c83251	‘If you are unfaithful,
c83252	I will scatter you among the nations,
c83253	but [if] you return to Me
c83254	to keep ... My commandments,
c83255	and practice
c83256	then even if your exiles have been banished to the ends of the earth,
c83257	I will gather them from there
c83258	and bring them to the place
c83259	I have chosen
c83260	as a dwelling for My Name.’
c83261	They are Your servants and Your people.
c83262	You redeemed them by Your great power and mighty hand.
c83263	O Lord,
c83264	may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and to the prayers of Your servants
c83265	who delight
c83266	in reverence of Your name.
c83267	Give Your servant success this day, I pray,
c83268	and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”
c83269	(For I was the cupbearer to the king.)
c83270	Now in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, ... been
c83271	when wine was set before him,
c83272	I took the wine
c83273	and gave it to the king.
c83274	I had never ... sad in his presence,
c83275	so the king said to me,
c83276	“Why [is] your face sad,
c83277	though you [are]
c83278	not ill?
c83279	This could only be
c83280	sadness of the heart.”
c83281	I was overwhelmed with fear
c83282	and replied to the king,
c83283	“May the king live forever!
c83284	Why should I not be sad
c83285	when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins,
c83286	and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”
c83287	replied the king.
c83288	“What is your request?”
c83289	So I prayed to the God of heaven
c83290	and answered the king,
c83291	“If it pleases the king,
c83292	and if your servant has found favor in your sight,
c83293	I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city where my fathers are buried,
c83294	so that I may rebuild it.”
c83295	Then the king, ... asked me,
c83296	with the queen seated beside him,
c83297	“How long will your journey take,
c83298	and when will you return?”
c83299	So it pleased the king
c83300	to send me,
c83301	and I set a time.
c83302	I also said to [him],
c83303	“If it pleases the king,
c83304	may letters be given to me for the governors west of the Euphrates,
c83305	so that they will grant me safe passage
c83306	until I reach Judah.
c83307	And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper ... forest,
c83308	of the king’s
c83309	so that he will give me timber
c83310	to make beams for the gates of the citadel
c83311	to the temple,
c83312	for the city wall,
c83313	and for the house
c83314	I will occupy.”
c83315	hand of my God ... the king granted my requests.
c83316	And because the gracious ... was upon me,
c83317	Then I went to the governors west of the Euphrates
c83318	and gave them the king's letters.
c83319	The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.
c83320	But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this,
c83321	they were deeply disturbed
c83322	that someone had come
c83323	to seek the well-being of the Israelites.
c83324	After I arrived in Jerusalem
c83325	and had been there three days,
c83326	I set out at night with a few men.
c83327	I did not tell anyone
c83328	what my God had laid on my heart
c83329	to do for Jerusalem.
c83330	animal with me
c83331	The only ... was the one
c83332	on which I was riding.
c83333	So I went out at night through the Valley Gate
c83334	toward the Well of the Serpent
c83335	and the Dung Gate,
c83336	and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem
c83337	that had been broken down
c83338	and the gates that had been destroyed by fire.
c83339	Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool,
c83340	but [there was] no room for the animal
c83341	under me to get through;
c83342	so I went up the valley by night
c83343	and inspected the wall.
c83344	Then I headed back
c83345	and reentered through the Valley Gate.
c83347	The officials did not know
c83348	where I had gone
c83349	or what I was doing,
c83350	for I had not yet told the Jews or priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.
c83351	Then I said to them,
c83352	“You see the trouble
c83353	we are in.
c83354	Jerusalem lies in ruins,
c83355	and its gates have been burned down.
c83356	Come,
c83357	let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem,
c83358	so that we will no longer be a disgrace.”
c83359	I also told them ... hand of my God
c83360	about the gracious ... upon me,
c83361	and ... the king
c83362	what ... had said to me.
c83363	they replied,
c83364	“Let us start
c83365	rebuilding,”
c83366	and they set their hands to [this] good [work].
c83367	When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard about this,
c83368	they mocked us
c83369	and ridiculed us, ... against
c83370	saying,
c83371	“What is this
c83372	you are doing?
c83373	Are you rebelling ... the king?”
c83374	So I answered them
c83375	and said,
c83376	“The God of heaven
c83377	is the One who will grant us success.
c83378	We, His servants, will start
c83379	rebuilding,
c83380	but you have no portion, right, or claim in Jerusalem.”
c83381	Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests began
c83382	At the Sheep Gate, ... rebuilding.
c83383	They dedicated it
c83384	and installed its doors.
c83385	After building as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel, they dedicated [the wall].
c83386	The men of Jericho built next to Eliashib,
c83387	and Zaccur son of Imri built next to them.

c83410	The Valley Gate was repaired by Hanun and the residents of Zanoah.
c83411	They rebuilt it,
c83412	installed its doors, bolts, and bars,
c83413	and [repaired] a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the Dung Gate.
c83414	The Dung Gate was repaired by Malchijah son of Rechab, ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem,

c83416	and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.

c83418	He rebuilt it,
c83419	roofed it,
c83420	and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.
c83421	He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah near the king’s garden, as far as the stairs
c83422	that descend from the City of David.
c83423	Beyond him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of a half-district of Beth-zur, made repairs up to a point opposite the tombs of David, as ... pool
c83424	far as the artificial
c83425	and the House of the Mighty.

c83430	opposite the Ascent to the Armory, near the angle [in the wall].

c83434	And next to him, the priests from the surrounding area made repairs.
c83435	Beyond them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their house,
c83436	and next to them, Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs beside his house.
c83437	After him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah to the angle and the corner,
c83438	and Palal son of Uzai [made repairs] opposite the angle and the tower
c83439	that juts out ... palace of the king
c83440	from the upper
c83441	near the courtyard of the guard.
c83442	Next to him, Pedaiah son of Parosh
c83443	and the temple servants living on [the hill of] Ophel
c83444	made repairs opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the tower
c83445	that juts out.
c83446	And next to them, the Tekoites made repairs to another section, from a point opposite the great tower
c83447	that juts out
c83448	to the wall of Ophel.
c83449	Above the Horse Gate, ... of the priests made repairs
c83450	each ... in front of his [own] house.

c83456	And between the upper room above the corner and the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs.
c83457	Now
c83458	when Sanballat heard
c83459	that we were rebuilding the wall,
c83460	he became furious
c83461	and was filled with indignation.
c83462	He ridiculed the Jews
c83463	before his associates and the army of Samaria, saying,
c83465	“What are these feeble Jews doing?
c83466	Can they restore [the wall] by themselves? ... Can they bring these
c83467	Will they offer sacrifices?
c83468	Will they complete it in a day?
c83469	stones back to life from the mounds of rubble?”
c83470	burnt
c83471	Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him,
c83472	said,
c83473	even ... what they are building,
c83474	“If ... a fox were to climb up on
c83475	it would break down their wall of stones!”
c83476	Hear us,
c83477	O God,
c83478	for we are despised.
c83479	Turn their scorn back upon their own heads,
c83480	and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity.
c83481	Do not cover up their iniquity
c83482	or let their sin be blotted out from Your sight,
c83483	for they have provoked the builders.
c83484	So we rebuilt the wall
c83485	until all [of it] was joined together up to half its [height],
c83486	for the people had a mind
c83487	to work.
c83489	When Sanballat and Tobiah, together with the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites, heard
c83490	that the repair to the walls of Jerusalem was progressing
c83491	and that the gaps
c83492	were being closed,
c83493	they were furious,
c83494	and all of them conspired
c83495	to come
c83496	and fight against Jerusalem
c83497	and create a hindrance.
c83498	So we prayed to our God
c83499	and posted a guard against them day and night.
c83500	Meanwhile, the people of Judah said:
c83501	“The strength of the laborer fails,
c83502	and there is so much rubble
c83503	that we will never be able
c83504	to rebuild the wall.”
c83505	And our enemies said,
c83506	they know ... [a thing],
c83507	[or] see
c83508	“Before ... we will come into their midst,
c83509	kill them,
c83510	and put an end to the work.”
c83511	At that time
c83512	the Jews ... came
c83513	who lived nearby
c83514	and told us ten times [over],
c83515	“Wherever
c83516	you turn, they will attack us.”
c83517	So I stationed [men] behind the lowest sections of the wall, at the vulnerable areas.
c83518	I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows.
c83519	After I had made an inspection,
c83520	I stood up
c83521	and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people,
c83522	“Do not be afraid of them.
c83523	Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome,
c83524	and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.”
c83526	When our enemies heard
c83527	that we were aware
c83528	of their scheme and that God had frustrated it,
c83529	each of us returned to ... the wall.
c83530	his own work on
c83531	And from that day on,
c83532	half of my men did the work
c83533	while the other half held
c83534	spears, shields, bows, and armor.
c83535	The officers [stationed themselves] behind all the people of Judah
c83536	who were rebuilding the wall.
c83537	The laborers who carried materials
c83538	worked with one hand
c83539	and held a weapon with the other.
c83540	And each of the builders ... with his sword strapped at his side.
c83541	worked
c83542	But the trumpeter stayed beside me.
c83543	Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people:
c83544	“The work [is] great
c83545	and extensive,
c83546	and we are spread out ... along the wall.
c83547	far from one another
c83548	Wherever
c83549	you hear the sound of the trumpet,
c83550	rally to us there.
c83551	Our God will fight for us!”
c83552	So we continued the work,
c83553	while half of [the men] held spears
c83554	from the break of dawn
c83555	until the stars came out.
c83556	At that time I also said to the people,
c83557	“Let every man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem,
c83558	so that they can stand guard by night
c83559	and work by day.”
c83560	So neither I nor brothers nor my men
c83561	with me
c83562	changed out of our clothes;
c83563	nor the guards ... each carried his weapon, [even to go] for water.
c83564	About this time there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews.
c83566	Some were saying,
c83567	“We [and] our sons and daughters are numerous.
c83568	We must get grain
c83569	to eat
c83570	and live.”
c83572	Others were saying,
c83573	“We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our homes
c83574	to get grain during the famine.”
c83576	Still others were saying,
c83577	“We have borrowed money [to pay] the king's tax [on] our fields and vineyards.
c83579	are just like our countrymen
c83580	We and our children ... and their children,
c83582	yet we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery.
c83583	Some of our daughters are already enslaved,
c83584	but we are powerless [to redeem them]
c83585	because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”
c83586	I became extremely angry,
c83587	When I heard their outcry and these complaints,
c83588	and after serious thought ... against them
c83589	I rebuked the nobles and officials,
c83590	saying,
c83591	usury
c83592	“vvv ... from your own brothers!”
c83593	You are exacting
c83594	So I called a large assembly
c83595	and said,
c83596	“We ... to buy back our Jewish brothers
c83597	who were sold to foreigners,
c83598	have done our best
c83599	but now you are selling your own brothers,
c83600	that they may be sold back to us!”
c83601	But they remained silent,
c83602	for they could find nothing to say.
c83603	So I continued,
c83604	is not right.
c83605	“What you are doing
c83606	Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our foreign enemies?
c83607	I, as well as my brothers and my servants, have been lending [the people] money and grain.
c83608	Please, let us stop this usury.
c83609	Please restore to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses, along with the percentage of the money, grain, new wine, and olive oil
c83610	that you have been assessing them.”
c83611	they replied,
c83612	“We will restore [it],”
c83613	“and will require nothing more from them.
c83614	We will do
c83615	as you say.”
c83616	So I summoned the priests
c83617	and required [of the nobles and officials] an oath that they
c83618	would do what they had promised.
c83619	I also shook out the folds of my robe
c83620	and said,
c83621	“May God likewise shake ... every man
c83622	who does not keep this promise.
c83623	out of his House and possession
c83624	May [such a man] be shaken out and have nothing!”
c83625	The whole assembly said,
c83626	“Amen,”
c83627	and they praised the LORD.
c83628	And the people did as they had promised.
c83629	Furthermore, from the day
c83630	appointed
c83631	me to be their governor in the land of Judah,
c83632	King Artaxerxes ... from his twentieth year until his thirty-second year (12 years total), neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.
c83633	The governors
c83634	before me
c83635	had heavily burdened the people,
c83636	taking from them bread and wine
c83637	plus forty shekels of silver.
c83638	Their servants also oppressed the people,
c83639	but I did not do this because of my fear of God.
c83640	Instead, I devoted myself to the construction of the wall,
c83641	we did not acquire any land.
c83642	and all my servants were gathered there for the work;
c83643	There were 150 Jews and officials
c83644	besides the guests from ... nations
c83645	the surrounding
c83646	at my table,
c83648	Each day, ... were prepared for me,
c83649	one ox, six choice sheep,
c83650	and some fowl
c83651	and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine was provided.
c83652	But I did not demand the food allotted to the governor, ... the
c83653	because the burden on ... people was so heavy.
c83654	Remember me
c83655	O my God,
c83656	favorably, ... for all
c83657	that I have done for this people.
c83659	When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard
c83660	that I had rebuilt the wall
c83661	and not a gap was left—
c83662	though to that time I had not yet installed the doors in the gates—
c83663	Sanballat and Geshem sent
c83664	me this message:
c83665	“Come,
c83666	let us meet together in [one of] the villages on the plain of Ono.”
c83667	But they were planning
c83668	to harm me.
c83669	So I sent messengers to them,
c83670	saying,
c83671	“I am doing a great work
c83672	and cannot
c83673	come down.
c83674	Why should the work stop
c83675	while I leave it
c83676	to go down to you?”
c83677	Four times they sent me the same message,
c83678	and each time I gave the same reply.
c83679	The fifth time, Sanballat sent me this same message by his young servant,
c83680	who had in his hand an unsealed letter
c83681	that read:
c83682	“It is reported among the nations—
c83683	and Geshem agrees—
c83684	that you and the Jews are plotting
c83685	to revolt,
c83686	[and] this is why you are building the wall.
c83687	According to these reports, you are to become their king,
c83688	and you have even appointed prophets
c83689	in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf:
c83691	‘There is a king in Judah.’
c83692	So
c83693	these rumors will reach the ears of the king.
c83694	Soon
c83695	come,
c83696	let us confer together.”
c83697	Then I sent him
c83698	this reply:
c83699	“There is nothing to these rumors
c83700	you are spreading;
c83701	you are inventing them in your own mind.”
c83702	For they were all [trying] to frighten us,
c83703	saying,
c83704	“Their hands will be weakened in the work,
c83705	and it will never be finished.”
c83706	But now, my God,
c83707	strengthen my hands.
c83708	Later, I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel,
c83709	who was confined
c83710	to his house. He said:
c83711	“Let us meet at the house of God inside the temple.
c83712	Let us shut the temple doors
c83713	because they are coming
c83714	to kill you—
c83715	by night they are coming
c83716	to kill you!”
c83717	But I replied,
c83718	“Should a man like me run away?
c83719	Should one like me
c83720	go into the temple
c83721	to save his own life?
c83722	I will not go!”
c83723	I realized
c83725	that God had not sent him,
c83726	but that he had uttered [this] prophecy against me because
c83727	Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
c83728	He had been hired to
c83729	intimidate me ... in order to
c83730	by doing as he suggested,
c83731	so that I would sin
c83732	so they could give me a bad name
c83733	discredit me.
c83734	remember
c83735	O my God,
c83736	Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done,
c83737	and also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets
c83738	who tried to intimidate me.
c83739	So the wall was completed in fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth of Elul.
c83741	When all our enemies heard about this,
c83742	all ... nations
c83743	the surrounding ... feared
c83744	and were disheartened,
c83745	for they realized
c83746	that this task had been accomplished by our God.
c83747	Also in those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters
c83748	to Tobiah,
c83750	and Tobiah’s letters
c83751	came back to them.
c83752	For many in Judah were bound by oath to him,
c83753	since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah,
c83754	and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.
c83755	Moreover, these nobles kept reporting to me Tobiah’s good deeds,
c83756	and they relayed my words to him.
c83757	And Tobiah sent letters
c83758	to intimidate me.
c83760	When the wall had been rebuilt
c83761	and I had set the doors in place,
c83762	the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed.
c83763	Then I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah the commander of the fortress,
c83764	because he was a faithful man
c83765	who feared God more than most.
c83766	And I told them,
c83767	“Do not open the gates of Jerusalem
c83768	until the sun is hot.
c83769	While the guards are on duty,
c83770	keep the doors shut
c83771	and securely fastened.
c83772	And appoint the residents of Jerusalem as guards,
c83773	some at their posts
c83774	and some at their own homes.”
c83775	Now the city was large and spacious,
c83776	but there were few people in it,
c83777	and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.
c83778	Then my God put into my heart
c83779	to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people
c83780	to be enrolled by genealogy.
c83781	I found the genealogical register
c83782	of those who had first returned,
c83783	and I found
c83784	the following written in it:
c83785	These are the people of the province
c83786	who came up from the captivity of the exiles
c83787	carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar [its] king.
c83788	They returned to Jerusalem and Judah,
c83789	each to his own town,

c83848	The temple servants and descendants of the servants of Solomon [numbered] 392 in all.
c83849	The following
c83850	came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer,
c83851	but could not
c83852	prove that their families were descended
c83853	from Israel:
c83854	the descendants of Delaiah, the descendants of Tobiah, and the descendants of Nekoda, 642[in all].
c83855	And from among the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, and the descendants of Barzillai
c83856	(who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite
c83857	and was called by their name).
c83858	These [men] searched for their family records,
c83860	but they could not find them
c83861	and so were excluded from the priesthood {as unclean}.
c83862	The governor ordered
c83863	them not to eat the most holy things
c83864	until there was a priest to consult the Urim and Thummim.
c83865	The whole assembly [numbered] 42,360,
c83866	in addition to ... menservants and maidservants,
c83867	their 7,337
c83868	as well as their 245 male and female singers.
c83869	435 camels,
c83870	and 6,720 donkeys.
c83871	Some of the heads of the families contributed to the project.
c83872	The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 darics of gold, 50 bowls, and 530 priestly garments.
c83873	And some of the heads of the families gave to the treasury for the project 20,000 darics of gold and 2,200 minas of silver.
c83875	The rest of the people gave [a total of]
c83876	20,000 darics of gold, 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 priestly garments.
c83877	So the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, and temple servants, along with some of the people and the rest of the Israelites, settled in their own towns.
c83878	And by the seventh month
c83879	the Israelites had settled in their towns.
c83880	At that time all the people gathered together at the square
c83881	before the Water Gate, ... that
c83882	and they asked Ezra the scribe
c83883	to bring the Book of the Law of Moses
c83884	the LORD had commanded Israel.
c83885	Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women and all
c83886	and understand.
c83887	who could listen
c83888	On the first day of the seventh month,
c83889	So [Ezra] read it aloud ... as he faced the square
c83890	before the Water Gate,
c83891	from daybreak until noon ... in front of the men and women and those who could understand.
c83892	And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.
c83893	Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform
c83894	built for this occasion.
c83895	At his right side stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah,
c83896	and at his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
c83897	Ezra opened the book in full view of all the people,
c83898	since he was standing above them all,
c83900	and as he opened it,
c83901	all the people stood up.
c83902	Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God,
c83903	all the people said,
c83904	“Amen, Amen!”
c83905	and with their hands uplifted,
c83906	Then they bowed down
c83907	and worshiped the LORD
c83908	with their faces to the ground.
c83909	The Levites— Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah— explained the law to the people
c83910	as they stood in their places.
c83911	So they read from the Book of the Law of God, explaining it
c83912	and giving insight,
c83913	so that the people could understand what was being read.
c83914	Nehemiah ... said
c83915	the governor, ... “This
c83916	Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites
c83917	who were instructing the people
c83918	to all of them,
c83919	day
c83920	is holy to the LORD your God.
c83921	Do not mourn
c83922	or weep.”
c83923	For all the people were weeping
c83924	as they heard the words of the Law.
c83925	Then [Nehemiah] told them,
c83926	“Go
c83927	and eat what is rich,
c83928	drink what is sweet,
c83929	and send out portions
c83930	to those who have nothing prepared,
c83931	since today is holy to our Lord.
c83932	Do not grieve,
c83933	for the joy of the LORD
c83934	is your strength.”
c83935	And the Levites calmed all the people,
c83936	saying,
c83937	“Be still,
c83938	since today is holy.
c83939	Do not grieve.”
c83940	Then all the people
c83941	began to eat
c83942	and drink,
c83943	to send out portions,
c83944	and to rejoice greatly,
c83945	because they understood the words
c83946	that had been made known to them.
c83947	On the second day [of the month], the heads of all the families, along with the priests and Levites, gathered around Ezra the scribe
c83948	to study the words of the Law.
c83949	And they found
c83950	written in the Law,
c83951	which the LORD had commanded through Moses,
c83952	that the Israelites were to dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month.
c83953	So they proclaimed
c83954	this message and spread [it] throughout their towns and in Jerusalem,
c83955	saying,
c83956	“Go out to the hill country
c83957	and bring back branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees,
c83958	to make booths, as it is written.”
c83959	And the people went out,
c83960	brought back [branches],
c83961	and made booths
c83962	on their own rooftops,
c83963	in their courtyards, in the court of the house of God, and in the squares by the Water Gate [and] by the Gate of Ephraim.
c83964	The whole assembly ... made
c83965	who had returned from exile
c83966	booths
c83967	and lived in them.
c83968	From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, they had not celebrated like this.
c83969	And there was great rejoicing.
c83970	Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. ... days,
c83971	The Israelites kept the feast for seven ... day
c83972	and on the eighth ... they held an assembly, according to the ordinance.
c83973	On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth,
c83974	with dust on their heads.
c83975	Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all the foreigners,
c83976	and they stood
c83977	and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
c83978	While they stood in their places,
c83979	they read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day,
c83980	and they spent another quarter of the day in confession
c83981	and worship of the LORD their God.
c83982	And the Levites— Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani— stood on the raised platform
c83983	and cried out in a loud voice to the LORD their God.
c83984	Then the Levites— Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah— said:
c83985	“Stand up
c83986	[and] bless the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting:
c83987	‘Blessed be Your glorious name,
c83988	and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.
c83989	You alone are the LORD.
c83990	created the heavens, the highest heavens with all their host,
c83991	the earth and all
c83992	that is on it,
c83993	the seas and all
c83994	that is in them.
c83995	You ... You give life to all things,
c83996	and the heavenly host worships You.
c83997	You are the LORD, the God
c83998	who chose Abram,
c83999	who brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans
c84000	and gave him the name Abraham.
c84001	You found his heart
c84002	faithful before You,
c84003	and made a covenant with him
c84004	to give the land of the Canaanites and Hittites, of the Amorites and Perizzites, of the Jebusites and Girgashites,
c84005	to give it to his descendants.
c84006	You have kept Your promise,
c84007	because You are righteous.
c84008	You saw the oppression of our fathers in Egypt;
c84009	You heard their cry at the Red Sea.
c84010	You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, all his officials, and all the people of his land,
c84011	for You knew
c84012	that they had acted with arrogance against [our fathers].
c84013	You made a name for Yourself that endures to this day.
c84014	You divided the sea before them,
c84015	and they crossed through it on dry ground.
c84016	You hurled their pursuers into the depths
c84017	like a stone into raging waters.
c84018	You led them with a pillar of cloud by day,
c84019	and a pillar of fire by night,
c84020	to light for them the way
c84021	which they should travel.
c84022	You came down on Mount Sinai,
c84023	and spoke to them from heaven.
c84024	You gave them just ordinances, true laws, and good statutes and commandments.
c84025	You revealed to them Your holy Sabbath,
c84026	and gave them commandments and statutes and laws through Your servant Moses.
c84027	In their hunger You provided bread from heaven;
c84028	in their thirst You brought water from the rock.
c84029	You told
c84030	them to go in
c84031	and possess the land
c84032	which You had sworn
c84033	to give them.
c84034	But they and our fathers became arrogant
c84035	and stiff-necked
c84036	and did not obey Your commandments.
c84037	They refused
c84038	to listen
c84039	and failed to remember the wonders
c84040	You performed among them.
c84041	They stiffened their necks
c84042	and appointed a leader
c84043	to return them to their bondage.
c84044	But You are a forgiving God,
c84045	gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in loving devotion,
c84046	and You did not forsake them.
c84047	Even after they had cast for themselves an image of a calf
c84048	and said,
c84049	“This is your God
c84050	who brought you up out of Egypt,”
c84051	and they had committed terrible blasphemies,
c84052	You, because of Your great compassion, did not forsake them in the wilderness.
c84053	By day the pillar of cloud never turned away
c84054	from guiding them on their path;
c84055	and by the night the pillar of fire
c84056	illuminated
c84057	the way
c84058	they should go.
c84059	You gave Your good Spirit
c84060	to instruct them.
c84061	You did not withhold Your manna from their mouths,
c84062	and You gave them water for their thirst.
c84063	For forty years You sustained them in the wilderness,
c84064	[so that] they lacked nothing.
c84065	Their clothes did not wear out,
c84066	and their feet did not swell.
c84067	You gave them kingdoms and peoples
c84068	and allotted to them every corner of the land.
c84069	So they took the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and of Og king of Bashan.
c84070	You multiplied their descendants like the stars of heaven
c84071	and brought them to the land
c84072	You had told their fathers
c84073	to enter
c84074	and possess.
c84075	So their descendants went in
c84076	and possessed the land.
c84077	You subdued before them the Canaanites dwelling in the land;
c84078	over to them,
c84079	You handed their kings and peoples
c84080	to do with them as they wished.
c84081	They captured fortified cities and fertile land
c84082	and took houses
c84083	full of all goods,
c84084	wells [already] dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance.
c84085	So they ate
c84086	and were filled;
c84087	they grew fat
c84088	and delighted in Your great goodness.
c84089	But they were disobedient
c84090	and rebelled against You;
c84091	they flung Your law behind their backs.
c84092	They killed Your prophets
c84093	who had admonished them
c84094	to turn back to You.
c84095	They committed terrible blasphemies.
c84096	So You delivered them into the hands of their enemies,
c84097	who oppressed them.
c84098	And in their time of distress, they cried out to You,
c84099	and You heard them from heaven.
c84100	In Your abundant compassion You gave them deliverers,
c84101	who rescued them from the hands of their enemies.
c84103	But as soon as they had rest,
c84104	they again
c84105	did evil in Your sight.
c84106	So You abandoned them to the hands of their enemies,
c84107	who had dominion over them.
c84108	to You again,
c84109	When they cried out
c84110	You heard from heaven,
c84111	And You delivered them many times in Your compassion.
c84112	You admonished them
c84113	to turn back to Your law,
c84114	but they were arrogant
c84115	and disobeyed Your commandments.
c84116	They sinned against Your ordinances,
c84117	by which a man ... if he practices them.
c84118	will live
c84119	They stubbornly shrugged their shoulders;
c84120	they stiffened their necks
c84121	and would not obey.
c84122	Yet You were patient with them for many years,
c84123	and Your Spirit admonished them through Your prophets,
c84124	but they would not listen;
c84125	so You gave them into the hands of the people of the land.
c84126	But in Your great compassion, You did not put an end to them;
c84127	nor did You forsake them,
c84128	for You are a gracious and compassionate God.
c84129	So now,
c84130	our God, the great and mighty and awesome God
c84131	who keeps His gracious covenant,
c84132	do not view lightly all the hardships
c84133	that has come upon us, and upon our kings and leaders, our priests and prophets, our ancestors and all Your people,
c84134	from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
c84135	You are just in all
c84136	that has befallen us,
c84137	because You have acted faithfully,
c84138	while we have acted wickedly.
c84139	Our kings and leaders and priests and fathers did not obey Your law
c84140	or listen to Your commandments and warnings
c84141	that You gave them.
c84142	For even while they were in their kingdom, with the abundant goodness
c84143	You had given them,
c84144	and in the spacious and fertile land
c84145	You set before them,
c84146	they would not serve You
c84147	or turn from their wicked ways.
c84148	So here we [are] today, slaves
c84149	in the land
c84150	You gave our fathers
c84151	to enjoy its fruit and its goodness.
c84152	And here we [are] as slaves!
c84153	Its abundant harvest goes to the kings
c84154	You have set over us because of our sins.
c84155	And they rule over our bodies
c84156	and our livestock as they please.
c84157	We are in great distress.’
c84158	In view of all this, we make a binding agreement,
c84159	putting it in writing
c84160	and sealing it with [the names of] our leaders, Levites, and priests.”
c84161	Now those who sealed [the document were]: Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah, and also Zedekiah,
c84162	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
c84163	Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,
c84164	Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,
c84165	Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
c84166	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
c84167	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
c84168	Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah.
c84169	These [were] the priests.
c84170	The Levites:
c84171	Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui
c84172	of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel,
c84173	and their associates:
c84174	Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
c84175	Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,
c84176	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
c84177	Hodiah, Bani, and Beninu.
c84178	The leaders of the people:
c84179	Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
c84180	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
c84181	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
c84182	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
c84183	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
c84184	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
c84185	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
c84186	Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
c84187	Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
c84188	Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
c84189	Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
c84190	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
c84191	Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,
c84192	Malluch, Harim, [and] Baanah.
c84193	“The rest of the people— the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, and temple servants, and all
c84194	who had separated themselves from the people of the land to obey the law of God—
c84195	along with their wives and all their sons and daughters
c84197	who were able to understand,
c84198	hereby join with their noble brothers
c84199	and commit themselves with a sworn oath
c84200	to follow the Law of God
c84201	given through [His] servant Moses
c84202	and to carefully
c84203	obey all the commandments, ordinances, and statutes of the LORD our Lord.
c84204	We will not give our daughters {in marriage} to the people of the land,
c84205	and we will not take their daughters for our sons.
c84206	When the people of the land
c84207	bring merchandise or any kind of grain ... on the Sabbath day,
c84208	to sell
c84209	we will not buy from them on a Sabbath day or holy day.
c84210	Every seventh year we will let the fields lie fallow, and will cancel every debt.
c84211	We also place ... under the obligation
c84212	ourselves ... to contribute a third of a shekel yearly for the service of the house of our God:
c84213	for the showbread, for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings, for the Sabbath offerings, for the New Moon and appointed feasts, for the holy offerings, for the sin offerings
c84214	to make atonement for Israel,
c84215	and for all the duties of the house of our God.
c84216	We have cast lots ... for the donation of wood
c84217	among the priests, Levites, and people
c84218	by our families at the appointed times each year. They are to bring it to the house of our God
c84219	to burn on the altar of the LORD our God,
c84220	as it is written in the Law.
c84221	We will also bring the firstfruits of our land and of every fruit tree to the house of the LORD year by year.
c84222	And ... the firstborn of our sons and our livestock,
c84223	as [it is] written in the Law,
c84224	and will bring the firstborn of our herds and flocks
c84225	we will bring ... to the house of our God, to the priests
c84226	who minister in the house of our God.
c84227	Moreover, we will bring to the priests at the storerooms of the house of our God the firstfruits of our dough, of our grain offerings, of the fruit of all our trees, and of our new wine and oil.
c84228	A tenth of our produce belongs to the Levites,
c84229	for [they]
c84230	should receive tithes in all the towns where we labor.
c84231	A priest descended from Aaron is to accompany the Levites
c84232	when they collect the tenth,
c84233	and the Levites are to bring a tenth of these tithes to the storerooms of the treasury in the house of our God.
c84234	For the Israelites and the Levites are to bring the contributions of grain, new wine, and oil to the storerooms
c84235	where the articles of the sanctuary [are kept] ... priests,
c84236	and where the ministering
c84237	the gatekeepers, and the singers [stay].
c84238	Thus we will not neglect the house of our God.”
c84239	Now the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem,
c84240	and the rest of the people cast lots
c84241	to bring one out of ten
c84242	to live in the holy city of Jerusalem,
c84243	while the remaining nine [were to dwell] in [their own] cities.
c84244	And the people blessed all the men
c84245	who volunteered
c84246	to live in Jerusalem.
c84247	These are the heads of the provinces
c84248	who settled in Jerusalem
c84249	(but in the villages of Judah ... lived
c84250	each ... on his own property
c84251	in their towns— the Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants, and descendants of Solomon’s servants—
c84252	while some of the descendants of Judah and Benjamin settled in Jerusalem.) From the descendants
c84253	of Judah:
c84254	Athaiah son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, a descendant of Perez;
c84255	and Maaseiah son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, a descendant of Shelah.
c84256	The descendants of Perez ... totaled
c84257	who settled in Jerusalem
c84258	468 men of valor.
c84259	From the descendants of Benjamin:
c84260	Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah,
c84261	and his followers Gabbai and Sallai—
c84262	928men.
c84263	Joel son of Zichri was the officer over them,
c84264	and Judah son of Hassenuah [was] over the city's second district.
c84265	From the priests:
c84266	Jedaiah son of Joiarib, Jachin,
c84267	Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the chief official of the house of God,
c84268	and their associates
c84269	who did the work at the temple—
c84270	822men;
c84271	Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah
c84272	and his associates, the leaders of families—
c84273	242men;
c84274	and Amashai son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
c84275	and his associates— ... mighty warriors.
c84276	128
c84277	Zabdiel son of Haggedolim was their overseer.
c84278	From the Levites:
c84279	Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
c84280	Shabbethai and Jozabad,
c84281	who supervised the work outside the house of God;
c84282	two leaders of the Levites,
c84283	Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who led
c84284	in thanksgiving and prayer;
c84285	Bakbukiah,
c84286	second among his associates;
c84287	and Abda son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
c84288	The Levites in the holy city totaled 284.
c84289	And the gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their associates,
c84290	who kept watch at the gates—
c84291	172men.
c84292	The rest of the Israelites, with the priests and Levites, [were] in all the villages of Judah,
c84293	each on his own inheritance.
c84294	The temple servants lived on the hill of Ophel,
c84295	with Ziha and Gishpa over [them].
c84296	Now the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica.
c84297	[He was] one of Asaph's descendants, who were the singers
c84298	in charge of the service of the house of God.
c84299	For [there was] a command from the king concerning [the singers],
c84300	an ordinance regulating [their] daily activities.
c84301	Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, a descendant of Zerah son of Judah, was the king’s agent in every matter concerning the people.
c84302	As for the villages with their fields,
c84303	some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba, Dibon, and Jekabzeel, and their villages;
c84304	in Jeshua, Moladah, and Beth-pelet;
c84305	in Hazar-shual, in Beersheba and its villages;
c84306	in Ziklag, in Meconah and its villages;
c84307	in En-rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth,
c84308	Zanoah, and Adullam, with their villages;
c84309	in Lachish with its fields
c84310	and Azekah and its villages.
c84311	So they settled from Beersheba all the way to the Valley of Hinnom.
c84312	The descendants of Benjamin from Geba [lived] in Michmash, Aija, and Bethel and its villages,
c84313	Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
c84314	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
c84315	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
c84316	Lod, Ono, and in the Valley of the Craftsmen.
c84317	And some divisions of the Levites of Judah settled in Benjamin.
c84318	Now these are the priests and Levites
c84319	who went up with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with Jeshua:
c84320	Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
c84321	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
c84322	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
c84323	Iddo, Ginnethon, Abijah,
c84324	Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
c84325	Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
c84326	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, [and] Jedaiah.
c84327	These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Jeshua.
c84328	The Levites [were] Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah,
c84329	who, with his associates, led the songs of thanksgiving.
c84330	Bakbukiah and Unni, their associates, [stood] across from them in the services.
c84331	Jeshua was the father of Joiakim,
c84332	Joiakim was the father of Eliashib,
c84333	Eliashib was the father of Joiada,
c84334	Joiada was the father of Jonathan,
c84335	and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua.
c84336	In the days of Joiakim, these were the heads of the priestly families:
c84337	of [the family of] Seraiah, Meraiah;
c84338	of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
c84339	of Ezra, Meshullam;
c84340	of Amariah, Jehohanan;
c84341	of Melichu, Jonathan;
c84342	of Shebaniah, Joseph;
c84343	of Harim, Adna;
c84344	of Meraioth, Helkai;
c84345	of Iddo, Zechariah;
c84346	of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
c84347	of Abijah, Zichri;
c84348	of Minjamin
c84349	and of Moadiah, Piltai;
c84350	of Bilgah, Shammua;
c84351	of Shemaiah, Jonathan;
c84352	of Joiarib, Mattenai;
c84353	of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
c84354	of Sallu, Kallai;
c84355	of Amok, Eber;
c84356	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah;
c84357	[and] of Jedaiah, Nethanel;
c84358	of the Levites
c84359	In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the heads of the families ... were recorded
c84360	and priests ... during the reign of Darius the Persian.
c84361	As for the descendants of Levi,
c84362	the family heads ... were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles.
c84363	up to the days of Johanan son of Eliashib
c84364	The leaders of the Levites [were] Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel,
c84365	along with their associates, [who stood] across from them
c84366	to give praise
c84367	and thanksgiving
c84368	as one section alternated with the other, as prescribed by David the man of God.
c84369	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, [and] Akkub [were] gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.
c84370	They [served] in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe.
c84371	At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from all their homes
c84372	and brought to Jerusalem
c84373	to celebrate the joyous dedication
c84374	with thanksgiving and singing, accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres.
c84375	The singers were also assembled
c84376	from the region around Jerusalem,
c84377	from the villages of the Netophathites,
c84378	from Beth-gilgal,
c84379	and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth,
c84380	for [they] had built villages for themselves all around Jerusalem.
c84381	After the priests and Levites had purified themselves,
c84382	they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
c84383	Then I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall,
c84384	and I appointed two great thanksgiving [choirs].
c84385	One was to proceed along the top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate.
c84386	Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed,
c84387	along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
c84388	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
c84389	and some of the priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
c84390	and his associates— Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani— with the musical instruments [prescribed by] David the man of God.
c84391	Ezra the scribe led the procession.
c84392	At the Fountain Gate
c84393	they climbed the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
c84394	The second thanksgiving [choir]
c84395	proceeded to the left,
c84396	and I followed it with half the people
c84397	along the top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,
c84398	over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. ... at the Gate
c84399	And they stopped ... of the Guard.
c84400	The two thanksgiving [choirs] then stood in the house of God,
c84401	as did I,
c84402	along with the half of the officials accompanying me,
c84403	as well as the priests with their trumpets— Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah—
c84404	and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer.
c84405	Then the choirs sang out under the direction of Jezrahiah.
c84406	On that day they offered great sacrifices,
c84407	rejoicing
c84408	because God had given them great joy.
c84409	The women and children also rejoiced,
c84410	so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.
c84411	And on that same day men were appointed over the rooms that housed the supplies, contributions, firstfruits, and tithes.
c84412	The portions [specified] by the Law for the priests and Levites were gathered into [these storerooms] from the fields of the villages,
c84413	because Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites
c84414	who were serving.
c84415	They performed the service of their God and the service of purification,
c84416	along with the singers and gatekeepers,
c84417	as David and his son Solomon had prescribed.
c84418	For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there were directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
c84419	So in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. ... daily portions
c84420	They also set aside ... for the Levites,
c84421	and the Levites set aside daily portions for the descendants of Aaron.
c84422	At that time the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people,
c84423	and ... they found
c84424	in it ... the passage stating
c84425	that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,
c84426	because they had not met the Israelites with food and water,
c84427	but had hired Balaam ... against them
c84428	to call down a curse
c84429	(although our God had turned the curse into a blessing).
c84430	As soon as
c84431	[the people] heard this law,
c84432	they excluded from Israel all of foreign descent.
c84433	Now before this, Eliashib the priest,
c84434	had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God
c84435	a relative of Tobiah,
c84436	and had prepared for [Tobiah] a large room
c84437	where they had previously stored the grain offerings, the incense, the [temple] articles, and the tithes of grain, new wine, and oil
c84438	prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, along with the contributions for the priests.
c84439	While all this was happening, I was not in Jerusalem,
c84440	because I had returned to King Artaxerxes of Babylon in the thirty-second year of his reign.
c84441	Some time later I obtained leave from the king
c84442	to return to Jerusalem.
c84443	Then I discovered the evil
c84444	that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah
c84445	by providing him a room in the courts of the house of God.
c84446	And I was greatly displeased
c84447	and threw all of Tobiah’s household goods out of the room.
c84448	Then I ordered
c84449	that the rooms be purified,
c84450	and I had the articles of the house of God restored to them, along with the grain offerings and incense.
c84451	I also learned
c84452	that because the portions for the Levites had not been given them,
c84453	had gone back
c84454	all ... to their own fields.
c84455	the Levites and singers
c84456	responsible for performing the service
c84457	So I rebuked the officials
c84458	and asked,
c84459	“Why has the house of God been neglected?”
c84460	Then I gathered the Levites and singers together
c84461	and stationed them at their posts,
c84462	and all Judah brought a tenth of the grain, new wine, and oil into the storerooms.
c84463	I appointed as treasurers over the storerooms Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites,
c84464	with Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, to assist them,
c84465	because they were considered trustworthy.
c84466	They were responsible for
c84467	distributing the supplies to their fellow [Levites].
c84468	Remember
c84469	O my God,
c84470	me for this,
c84471	and do not blot out my deeds of loving devotion
c84472	for the house of my God and for its services.
c84473	In those days I saw people in Judah
c84474	treading wine presses on the Sabbath
c84475	and bringing in grain
c84476	and loading it on donkeys,
c84477	along with wine, grapes, and figs. All kinds of goods
c84478	were being brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.
c84479	So I warned them ... on that day.
c84480	against selling food
c84481	Additionally, [men of] Tyre
c84482	who lived there
c84483	were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise
c84484	and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah
c84485	in Jerusalem.
c84486	Then I rebuked the nobles of Judah
c84487	and asked,
c84488	“What is this evil
c84489	you are doing—
c84490	profaning the Sabbath day?
c84491	Did not your forefathers do the same things,
c84492	so that our God brought all this disaster on us and on this city?
c84493	And now you are rekindling His wrath against Israel
c84494	by profaning the Sabbath!”
c84496	When the evening shadows began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem, just before the Sabbath,
c84497	I ordered
c84498	that the gates be shut
c84500	and not opened until after the Sabbath.
c84501	I posted some of my servants at the gates,
c84502	so that no goods could enter on the Sabbath day.
c84503	Once or twice, the merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem,
c84504	but I warned them,
c84506	“Why are you camping in front of the wall?
c84507	If you do it again,
c84508	I will lay hands on you.”
c84509	From that time on, they did not return on the Sabbath.
c84510	Then I instructed the Levites
c84511	to purify themselves
c84513	and guard the gates
c84514	in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.
c84515	Remember me for this as well,
c84516	O my God,
c84517	and {show} me mercy according to Your abundant loving devotion.
c84518	In those days I also saw Jews
c84519	who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.
c84520	of their children
c84521	Half ... spoke the language of Ashdod
c84522	but could not
c84523	speak Hebrew.
c84524	or of the other peoples,
c84525	I rebuked them
c84526	and called down curses on them.
c84527	I beat some of these men
c84528	and pulled out their hair.
c84529	Then I made them take an oath before God [and said]:
c84530	“You must not give your daughters in marriage to their sons
c84531	or take their daughters as wives for your sons or for yourselves!
c84532	Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this?
c84533	There was not a king like him among many nations.
c84534	He was loved by his God,
c84535	and God made him king over all Israel,
c84536	yet foreign women drew him into sin.
c84538	Why should we now hear
c84539	that you too are doing all this terrible evil
c84540	and acting unfaithfully against our God
c84541	by marrying foreign women?”
c84542	Even one of the sons of Jehoiada son of Eliashib the high priest had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite.
c84543	Therefore I drove him away from me.
c84544	Remember them,
c84545	O my God,
c84546	because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
c84547	Thus I purified [the priests and Levites] from everything foreign,
c84548	and I assigned ... duties ... of the priests and Levites.
c84549	specific ... to each
c84550	I also arranged for contributions of wood at the appointed times, and for the firstfruits.
c84551	Remember me,
c84552	O my God,
c84553	with favor.
c84554	Adam, Seth, Enosh,
c84555	Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared,
c84556	Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech.
c84557	The sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
c84558	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
c84559	The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
c84560	The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim.
c84561	The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
c84562	The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabta, Raamah, and Sabteca.
c84563	And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.

c85305	because they had responsibility for guarding it
c85306	and opening it
c85307	every morning.
c85308	Some of them were in charge of the articles used in worship,
c85309	to count them whenever they were brought in
c85310	[or] taken out.
c85311	Others were put in charge of the furnishings and other articles of the sanctuary, as well as the fine flour, wine, oil, incense, and spices.
c85312	And [some] of the sons of the priests mixed the spices.
c85313	A Levite named Mattithiah,
c85314	the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite,
c85315	was entrusted with baking the bread.
c85316	Some of their Kohathite brothers were responsible for ... the rows of the showbread
c85317	preparing ... every Sabbath.
c85318	Those who were musicians,
c85319	the heads of Levite families,
c85320	stayed in the temple chambers and were exempt
c85321	[from other duties] because they were on duty day and night.
c85322	All these were heads of Levite families, ... according to their genealogies,
c85323	chiefs
c85324	and lived in Jerusalem.
c85325	Jeiel was the father of Gibeon, and he lived in Gibeon.
c85326	His wife’s name was Maacah.
c85327	Abdon was his firstborn son,
c85328	then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
c85329	Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth.
c85330	Mikloth was the father of Shimeam.
c85331	These also lived alongside their relatives in Jerusalem.
c85332	Ner was the father of Kish,
c85333	Kish was the father of Saul,
c85334	and Saul was the father of Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Esh-baal.
c85335	The son of Jonathan: Merib-baal,
c85336	[who] was the father of Micah.
c85337	The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, [and Ahaz].
c85338	Ahaz was the father of Jarah;
c85339	Jarah was the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri;
c85340	and Zimri was the father of Moza.
c85341	Moza was the father of Binea.
c85342	Rephaiah [was] his son,
c85343	Elasah his son,
c85344	and Azel his son.
c85345	And Azel had six sons,
c85346	and these were their names:
c85347	Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan.
c85348	These [were] the sons of Azel.
c85349	Now the Philistines fought against Israel,
c85350	and the Israelites fled before them,
c85351	and [many] fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
c85352	The Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons,
c85353	and they killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua.
c85354	When the battle intensified against Saul,
c85355	overtook him
c85356	the archers
c85357	and wounded him critically.
c85358	Then Saul said to his armor-bearer,
c85359	“Draw your sword
c85360	and run it through me,
c85361	or these uncircumcised men will come
c85362	and torture me!”
c85363	But his armor-bearer refused,
c85364	because he was terrified.
c85365	So Saul took his own sword
c85366	and fell on it.
c85367	When his armor-bearer saw
c85368	that Saul was dead,
c85369	he too fell on his own sword
c85370	and died.
c85371	So Saul ... with his three sons
c85372	died together ... and all his house.
c85373	When all the Israelites ... saw
c85374	in the valley
c85375	that the army had fled
c85376	and that Saul and his sons had died,
c85377	they abandoned their cities
c85378	and ran away.
c85379	So the Philistines came
c85380	and occupied them.
c85381	The next day,
c85382	when the Philistines came
c85383	to strip the dead,
c85384	they found Saul and his sons
c85385	fallen on Mount Gilboa.
c85386	They stripped Saul,
c85387	cut off his head, took his armor,
c85388	and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines
c85389	to proclaim the news [in the temple] of their idols and among their people.
c85390	They put his armor in the temple of their gods
c85391	and hung his head in the temple of Dagon.
c85392	When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard about everything
c85393	the Philistines had done to Saul,
c85394	all their valiant warriors set out
c85395	and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons
c85396	and brought them to Jabesh.
c85397	And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh
c85398	and fasted seven days.
c85399	So Saul died for his unfaithfulness
c85400	to the LORD,
c85401	the word of the LORD
c85402	because he did not keep
c85403	and even consulted a medium
c85404	for guidance,
c85405	and he failed to inquire of the LORD.
c85406	So the LORD put him to death
c85407	and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
c85408	Then all Israel came together to David at Hebron
c85409	and said,
c85410	“Here we [are], your own flesh and blood.
c85411	Even in times past,
c85412	while Saul was king,
c85413	you [were]
c85414	the one who led
c85415	Israel out and brought them back.
c85416	And to you the LORD your God said,
c85417	‘You will shepherd My people Israel,
c85418	and you will be ruler over [them].’”
c85419	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron,
c85420	[where] David made a covenant with them before the LORD.
c85421	And they anointed [him] king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD through Samuel.
c85422	Then David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem
c85423	(that is, Jebus),
c85424	where the Jebusites inhabited the land.
c85425	The people of Jebus said to David,
c85426	“You will never get in here.”
c85427	Nevertheless , David captured the fortress of Zion
c85428	(that is, the City of David).
c85429	Now David had said,
c85430	“Whoever
c85431	is the first to strike down a Jebusite
c85432	will become chief commander.”
c85433	And Joab son of Zeruiah went up first,
c85434	and he became the chief.
c85435	So David took up residence in the fortress;
c85436	that is why it was called the City of David.
c85437	He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding wall,
c85438	while Joab restored the rest of the city.
c85439	And David became greater and greater,
c85440	for the LORD of Hosts was with him.
c85441	Now these [were] the chiefs ... mighty men,
c85442	of David’s ... who,
c85443	together with all Israel, ... strong support to his kingdom,
c85444	gave ... according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
c85445	This is the list ... mighty men:
c85446	of David’s
c85447	Jashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief of the officers;
c85448	he wielded his spear against three hundred men,
c85449	whom he killed at one time.
c85450	Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite,
c85451	one of the three mighty men.
c85452	He was with David at Pas-dammim
c85453	when the Philistines gathered there for battle.
c85454	At the place with a field
c85455	full of barley,
c85456	the troops fled from the Philistines.
c85457	But Eleazar and David stationed themselves in the middle of the field
c85458	and defended it.
c85459	They struck down the Philistines,
c85460	and the LORD brought about a great victory.
c85461	Three of the thirty chief men went down to David, to the rock at the cave of Adullam,
c85462	while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
c85463	At that time David was in the stronghold,
c85464	and the garrison of the Philistines was at Bethlehem.
c85465	David longed for water
c85466	and said,
c85467	“Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well ... of Bethlehem!”
c85468	near the gate
c85469	So the Three broke through the Philistine camp,
c85470	drew water from the well ... of Bethlehem,
c85471	at the gate
c85473	and brought it back to David.
c85474	But he refused
c85475	to drink it;
c85476	instead , he poured it out to the LORD,
c85477	saying,
c85478	“Far be it from me, my God,
c85479	to do this!
c85480	How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?”
c85481	Because they had brought it at the risk of their lives,
c85482	[David] refused
c85483	to drink it.
c85484	Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
c85485	Now Abishai, the brother of Joab,
c85486	was chief of the Three, and he
c85487	lifted his spear against three hundred [men], killed [them],
c85488	and won a name along with [the] Three.
c85489	Among the thirty he was most honored,
c85490	and he became their commander,
c85491	even though he was not included among the Three.
c85492	And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant warrior from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits.
c85493	[He] struck down two champions of Moab,
c85494	he went down
c85495	and on a snowy day ... into a pit and killed a lion.
c85496	He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man five cubits [tall].
c85497	Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam in his hand,
c85498	Benaiah went against him with a club,
c85499	snatched the spear from [his] hand,
c85500	and killed [the Egyptian] with his own spear.
c85501	These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada,
c85502	who won a name alongside the three mighty men.
c85503	of the Thirty,
c85505	He was the most honored ... but he
c85506	did not become one of the Three.
c85507	And David appointed him over his guard.
c85508	Now [these were] the mighty men: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
c85509	Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
c85510	Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
c85511	Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
c85512	Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
c85513	Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjamites, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
c85514	Hurai from the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
c85515	Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
c85516	the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
c85517	Ahiam son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,
c85518	Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
c85519	Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of Ezbai,
c85520	Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,
c85521	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite,
c85522	the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
c85523	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
c85524	Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,
c85525	Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, chief of the Reubenites,
c85526	and the thirty with him,
c85527	Hanan son of Maacah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,
c85528	Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
c85529	Jediael son of Shimri and his brother Joha the Tizite,
c85530	Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,
c85531	Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
c85532	Now these [were] the [men]
c85533	who came to David at Ziklag,
c85534	while he was still banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish.
c85535	They were among the warriors who helped him in battle;
c85536	they were archers
c85537	using both the right and left [to sling] stones and [to shoot] arrows;
c85538	[they were] Saul's kinsmen from Benjamin:
c85539	Ahiezer their chief,
c85540	and Joash, sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite,
c85541	Ishmaiah the Gibeonite,
c85542	a mighty man among the Thirty and leader over the Thirty;
c85543	Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite,
c85544	Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite;
c85545	Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam the Korahites;
c85546	and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
c85547	Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were mighty warriors, trained for battle,
c85548	experts with shield and spear,
c85549	whose faces [were like] the faces of lions
c85550	as gazelles on the mountains:
c85551	and who were as swift
c85552	Ezer the chief,
c85553	Obadiah the second [in command],
c85554	Eliab the third,
c85555	Mishmannah the fourth,
c85556	Jeremiah the fifth,
c85557	Attai the sixth,
c85558	Eliel the seventh,
c85559	Johanan the eighth,
c85560	Elzabad the ninth,
c85561	Jeremiah the tenth,
c85562	and Machbanai the eleventh.
c85563	These Gadites were army commanders,
c85564	the least [of whom] was a match for a hundred,
c85565	and the greatest for a thousand.
c85566	These are
c85567	the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month
c85568	when it had overflowed all its banks,
c85569	and they put to flight all [those] in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
c85570	Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold.
c85571	And David went out to meet them,
c85573	saying,
c85574	“If you have come to me in peace,
c85575	to help me,
c85576	my heart will be united with you;
c85577	but if you have come to betray me to my enemies
c85578	when my hands are free of violence,
c85579	may the God of our fathers see
c85580	and judge you.”
c85581	Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the Thirty, and he said:
c85582	“We are yours,
c85583	O David!
c85584	We are with you,
c85585	O son of Jesse!
c85586	Peace, peace to you,
c85587	and peace to your helpers,
c85588	for your God will help you.”
c85589	So David received
c85590	them and made them leaders of his troops.
c85591	Some from Manasseh defected ... David
c85592	to ... when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul.
c85593	(They did not help the Philistines
c85594	because the Philistine rulers consulted and sent David away,
c85595	saying,
c85596	“It will cost us our heads if he defects to his master Saul.”)
c85597	When David went to Ziklag,
c85598	these men of Manasseh defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands
c85599	in Manasseh.
c85600	They helped David against the raiders,
c85601	for ... all mighty warriors
c85602	they were ... and commanders in the army.
c85603	For at [that] time, men came to David day after day
c85604	to help him,
c85605	until he had a great army, like the army of God.
c85606	Now these [are] the numbers of men armed for battle
c85607	who came to David at Hebron
c85608	to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him, in accordance with the word of the LORD:
c85609	From the Judahites:
c85610	bearing shields and spears.
c85611	6,800 armed troops
c85612	From the Simeonites: 7,100 mighty warriors, ready for war.
c85613	From the Levites: 4,600,
c85614	including Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron,
c85615	with 3,700 men,
c85616	and Zadok, a valiant young warrior,
c85617	with 22 commanders from his own family.
c85618	From the Benjamites, the kinsmen of Saul: 3,000,
c85619	most of whom had remained loyal to the house of Saul up to that time.
c85620	From the Ephraimites: 20,800 mighty warriors, famous among their own clans.
c85621	From the half-tribe of Manasseh: 18,000
c85622	designated by name
c85623	to come
c85624	and make David king.
c85625	From the Issacharites,
c85626	who understood the times
c85627	and knew
c85628	what Israel should do:
c85629	200 chiefs
c85630	with all their kinsmen at their command.
c85631	From Zebulun:
c85632	fit for service,
c85633	trained for battle with all kinds of weapons of war,
c85634	50,000
c85635	were devoted to David.
c85636	who with one purpose
c85637	From Naphtali: 1,000 commanders,
c85638	accompanied by 37,000 men with shield and spear.
c85639	From the Danites:
c85640	prepared for battle.
c85641	28,600
c85642	From Asher:
c85643	fit for service,
c85644	prepared for battle.
c85645	40,000
c85646	And from east of the Jordan, from the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh [there]: 120,000 with every [kind] of weapon of war.
c85647	All these men of war,
c85648	arrayed for battle,
c85649	came to Hebron fully determined
c85650	to make David king over all Israel.
c85651	And all the rest of the Israelites [were] of one mind
c85652	to make David king.
c85653	They spent three days there eating ... with David,
c85654	and drinking
c85656	for their relatives had provided for them.
c85657	And their neighbors
c85658	from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali came bringing
c85659	food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen— abundant supplies
c85660	of flour, fig cakes and raisin cakes, wine and oil, oxen and sheep.
c85661	Indeed, there was joy in Israel.
c85662	Then David conferred with all his leaders, the commanders of hundreds and of thousands.
c85663	And he said to the whole assembly of Israel,
c85664	“If it seems good to you,
c85665	and if this is of the LORD our God,
c85666	far and wide
c85667	let us send word ... to ... of our brothers
c85668	the rest ... in all the land of Israel,
c85669	and also to the priests and Levites in their cities and pasturelands,
c85670	so that they may join us.
c85671	Then let us bring back the ark of our God,
c85672	for we did not inquire of Him in the days of Saul.”
c85673	And ... the whole assembly
c85674	agreed to do it.
c85675	because this proposal seemed right to all the people,
c85676	So David assembled all the Israelites, from the [River] Shihor in Egypt
c85677	to Lebo-hamath, to bring
c85678	the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
c85679	David and all Israel went up to Baalah ... (that is, Kiriath-jearim)
c85680	of Judah
c85681	to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD,
c85682	who is enthroned [between] the cherubim—
c85683	[the ark] that is called by the Name.
c85684	So they carried the ark of God from the house of Abinadab on a new cart,
c85685	with Uzzah and Ahio guiding the cart.
c85686	David and all the Israelites were celebrating before God with all their might,
c85687	with songs and on harps and lyres, with tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
c85688	When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon,
c85689	Uzzah reached out
c85690	and took hold of the ark,
c85691	because the oxen had stumbled.
c85692	And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah,
c85693	and He struck him
c85694	down because he had put his hand on the ark.
c85695	So he died there before God.
c85696	Then David became angry
c85697	because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah;
c85698	so he named that place Perez-uzza, as it is [called] to this day.
c85699	That day David feared God
c85700	and asked,
c85701	“How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?”
c85702	So [he] did not move the ark with him to the City of David; ... to
c85703	instead, he took it aside ... the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
c85704	Thus the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house for three months,
c85705	and the LORD blessed his household and everything
c85706	he owned.
c85707	Now King Hiram of Tyre sent envoys to David,
c85708	along with cedar logs, stonemasons, and carpenters,
c85709	to build a palace for him.
c85710	And David realized
c85711	that the LORD had established him as king over Israel
c85712	and had highly exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.
c85713	And David took more wives in Jerusalem
c85714	[and] became the father of more sons and daughters.
c85715	These are the names of the children born
c85716	to him in Jerusalem:
c85717	Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
c85718	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
c85719	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
c85720	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
c85721	When the Philistines heard
c85722	that David had been anointed king over all Israel,
c85723	they all went
c85724	in search of [him];
c85725	but David learned [of this]
c85726	and went out to face them.
c85727	Now the Philistines had come
c85728	and raided the Valley of Rephaim.
c85729	So David inquired of God,
c85730	replied
c85731	“Should I go up against the Philistines?
c85732	Will You deliver them into my hand?”
c85733	the LORD,
c85734	“Go,”
c85735	“for I will deliver them into your hand.”
c85736	So [David and his men] went up to Baal-perazim,
c85737	where [he] defeated the Philistines
c85738	[and] said,
c85739	“Like a bursting flood, God has burst out against my enemies by my hand.”
c85740	So they called that place Baal-perazim.
c85741	There the Philistines abandoned their gods,
c85742	and David ordered
c85743	that they be burned in the fire.
c85744	Once again the Philistines
c85745	raided the valley.
c85746	So David again inquired of God,
c85747	who answered him,
c85748	“Do not march up after them,
c85749	but circle around them
c85750	and attack them in front of the balsam trees.
c85751	As soon as
c85752	you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees,
c85753	then move out to battle,
c85754	because this will mean that God has marched out before you
c85755	to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
c85756	So David did
c85757	as God had commanded him,
c85758	and they struck down the army of the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
c85759	And David’s fame went out into every land,
c85760	and the LORD caused all nations to fear him.
c85761	David constructed buildings for himself in the City of David,
c85762	and he prepared a place for the ark of God
c85763	and pitched a tent for it.
c85764	Then David said,
c85765	“No ... may carry the ark of God,
c85766	one but the Levites
c85767	because the LORD has chosen
c85768	them to carry the ark of the LORD
c85769	and to minister before Him forever.”
c85770	And David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem
c85771	to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place
c85772	he had prepared for it.
c85773	Then he gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
c85774	From the Kohathites, Uriel the chief
c85775	and 120 of his relatives;
c85776	from the Merarites, Asaiah the chief
c85777	and 220 of his relatives;
c85778	from the Gershomites, Joel the chief
c85779	and 130 of his relatives;
c85780	from the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the chief
c85781	and 200 of his relatives;
c85782	from the Hebronites, Eliel the chief
c85783	and 80 of his relatives;
c85784	[and] from the Uzzielites, Amminadab the chief
c85785	and 112 of his relatives.
c85786	David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
c85787	And he said to them,
c85788	“You are the heads of the Levitical families.
c85789	You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves
c85790	so that you may bring the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel,
c85791	to [the place] I have prepared for it.
c85792	It was because you Levites were not with us the first time
c85793	that the LORD our God burst forth in anger against us.
c85794	For we did not consult Him about the proper order.”
c85795	So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves
c85796	to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.
c85797	And the Levites carried the ark of God
c85798	as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the LORD.
c85799	on their shoulders with the poles,
c85800	David also told the leaders of the Levites
c85801	to appoint their relatives
c85802	as singers ... accompanied by musical instruments— harps, lyres, and cymbals.
c85804	to raise their voices with joy,
c85805	So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel;
c85806	from his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah;
c85807	and from their brothers the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
c85808	and with them their brothers next in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
c85809	The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan ... the bronze cymbals;
c85810	were to sound
c85811	Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according to Alamoth;
c85812	and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah ... with lyres according to Sheminith.
c85813	were to lead the music
c85814	Chenaniah the head Levite
c85815	was the director of the music
c85816	because he [was] highly skilled.
c85817	Berechiah and Elkanah were to be guardians of the ark.
c85818	Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God.
c85819	Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be guardians of the ark.
c85820	So
c85821	David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands
c85822	went
c85823	with rejoicing to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom.
c85825	And because God had helped the Levites
c85826	who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
c85827	they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
c85828	Now David was dressed in a robe of fine linen,
c85829	as were all the Levites
c85830	who were carrying the ark,
c85831	as well as the singers and Chenaniah, the director of music for the singers.
c85832	David also wore a linen ephod.
c85833	So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, with the sounding of ram’s horns and trumpets, and with cymbals
c85834	and the music of harps and lyres.
c85835	was
c85836	As the ark of the covenant of the LORD ... entering the City of David,
c85837	Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window
c85838	and saw King David
c85839	dancing
c85840	and celebrating,
c85841	and she despised him in her heart.
c85842	So they brought the ark of God
c85843	and placed it inside the tent
c85844	that David had pitched for it.
c85845	And they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
c85846	When David had finished
c85847	sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings,
c85848	he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
c85849	Then he distributed to each and every Israelite, both men and women,
c85850	a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.
c85851	David appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD,
c85852	to celebrate,
c85853	to give thanks,
c85854	and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel.
c85855	Asaph was the chief,
c85856	Zechariah was second,
c85857	[then] Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel. They were to play the harps and lyres,
c85858	while Asaph sounded the cymbals
c85859	and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
c85860	On that day David first committed
c85861	to Asaph and his brothers [this song] of thanksgiving to the LORD:
c85862	“Give thanks to the LORD;
c85863	call upon His name;
c85864	make known His deeds among the nations.
c85865	Sing to Him,
c85866	sing praises to Him;
c85867	tell of all His wonders.
c85868	Glory in His holy name;
c85869	let the hearts ... rejoice.
c85870	of those who seek the LORD
c85871	Seek out the LORD and His strength;
c85872	seek His face always.
c85873	Remember the wonders
c85874	He has done,
c85875	His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced,
c85876	O offspring of Israel His servant,
c85877	O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
c85878	He is the LORD our God;
c85879	His judgments [carry] throughout the earth.
c85880	Remember His covenant forever,
c85881	the word
c85882	He ordained for a thousand generations—
c85883	[the covenant] He made with Abraham,
c85884	and the oath He swore to Isaac.
c85885	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
c85886	to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
c85888	‘I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.’
c85889	When they were few in number, few indeed,
c85890	and strangers in [the land],
c85891	they wandered from nation to nation
c85892	from [one] kingdom to another.
c85893	He let no man
c85894	oppress them;
c85895	He rebuked kings on their behalf:
c85896	‘Do not touch My anointed ones;
c85897	do no harm to My prophets.’
c85898	Sing to the LORD,
c85899	all the earth.
c85900	Proclaim His salvation day after day.
c85901	Declare His glory among the nations,
c85902	His wonders among all peoples.
c85903	For great is the LORD,
c85904	and greatly to be praised;
c85905	He is to be feared above all gods.
c85906	For all the gods of the nations are idols,
c85907	but [it is] the LORD who made the heavens.
c85908	Splendor and majesty are before Him;
c85909	strength and joy fill His dwelling.
c85910	Ascribe to the LORD,
c85911	O families of the nations,
c85912	ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
c85913	Ascribe to the LORD the glory [due] His name;
c85914	bring an offering
c85915	and come before Him.
c85916	Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness;
c85917	tremble before Him,
c85918	all the earth.
c85919	The world is firmly established;
c85920	it cannot be moved.
c85921	Let the heavens be glad,
c85922	and the earth rejoice;
c85923	let them say among the nations,
c85924	‘The LORD reigns!’
c85925	Let the sea resound, and all that fills it;
c85926	let the fields exult, and all
c85927	that [is] in them.
c85928	Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD,
c85929	for He is coming
c85930	to judge the earth.
c85931	Give thanks to the LORD,
c85932	for He is good;
c85933	His loving devotion endures forever.
c85934	Then cry out:
c85935	‘Save us,
c85936	O God of our salvation;
c85937	gather
c85938	and deliver us from the nations,
c85939	that we may give thanks to Your holy name,
c85940	that we may glory in Your praise.’
c85941	Blessed [be] the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.”
c85942	Then all the people said,
c85943	“Amen!”
c85944	and “Praise the LORD!”
c85945	So David left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
c85946	to minister [there] regularly according to the daily requirements,
c85947	along with Obed-edom and his sixty-eight relatives.
c85948	Obed-edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were to be gatekeepers.
c85949	And David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place
c85950	in Gibeon
c85951	to regularly present burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offerings, morning and evening,
c85952	according to all
c85953	that was written in the law of the LORD,
c85954	which He had commanded Israel to keep.
c85955	With them were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest
c85956	of those chosen
c85957	and designated by name
c85958	to give thanks to the LORD,
c85959	for “His loving devotion endures forever.”
c85960	Heman and Jeduthun had with them
c85961	trumpets and cymbals for the music
c85962	and instruments [for] the songs of God.
c85963	And the sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.
c85964	Then all the people departed
c85965	for their homes,
c85966	and David returned home
c85967	to bless his household.
c85968	After
c85969	David had settled into his palace,
c85970	he said to Nathan the prophet,
c85971	“Here I am, living in a house of cedar,
c85972	while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent.”
c85973	So Nathan told David,
c85974	all
c85975	that [is] in your heart,
c85976	“Do
c85977	for God is with you.”
c85978	But that night ... came
c85979	the word of God ... to Nathan,
c85980	saying,
c85981	“Go
c85982	and tell My servant David
c85983	that this is what the LORD says:
c85984	You are not the one to build a house for Me
c85985	to dwell in.
c85986	For I have not dwelt in a house from the day
c85987	I brought Israel up [from Egypt]
c85988	until this day,
c85989	but I have moved from tent to tent and dwelling to dwelling.
c85990	In all
c85991	My journeys with all the Israelites,
c85992	have I ever asked any [of the leaders] of Israel,
c85993	whom I commanded
c85994	to shepherd My people,
c85996	‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’
c85997	Now
c85998	then, you are to tell My servant David
c85999	that this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
c86000	I took you from the pasture, from following the flock,
c86001	to be the ruler over My people Israel.
c86002	I have been with you
c86003	wherever you have gone,
c86004	and I have cut off all your enemies before you.
c86005	Now I will make for you a name like the greatest
c86006	in the land.
c86007	And I will provide a place for My people Israel
c86008	and will plant them
c86009	so that they may dwell in a place of their own
c86010	and be disturbed no more.
c86011	No longer will the sons of wickedness
c86012	oppress them
c86013	as they did at the beginning
c86014	and [have done] since the day
c86015	I appointed judges over My people Israel.
c86016	And I will subdue all your enemies.
c86017	Moreover , I declare to you
c86018	that the LORD will build a house for you.
c86019	And
c86020	when your days are fulfilled
c86021	and you go [to be] with your fathers,
c86022	I will raise up your offspring after you,
c86023	one of your own sons,
c86024	and I will establish his kingdom.
c86025	He will build a house for Me,
c86026	and I will establish his throne forever.
c86027	I will be his Father,
c86028	and he will be My son.
c86029	And My loving devotion will never depart from him
c86030	as I removed [it]
c86031	from your predecessor.
c86032	But I will set him over My house and My kingdom forever,
c86033	and his throne will be established forever.”
c86034	According to all these words and this entire vision,
c86035	so Nathan spoke to David.
c86036	Then King David went in,
c86037	sat before the LORD,
c86038	and said,
c86039	“Who am I,
c86040	O LORD God,
c86041	and what is my house,
c86042	that You have brought me this far?
c86043	And as if this was a small thing in Your eyes,
c86044	O God,
c86045	You have spoken about the future of the house of Your servant
c86046	and have regarded me as a man of great distinction,
c86047	O LORD God.
c86048	What more can David say to You for so honoring Your servant?
c86049	For You know Your servant.
c86050	O LORD,
c86051	for the sake of Your servant and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished this great thing
c86052	and revealed all Your greatness.
c86053	O LORD,
c86054	[there is] none like You,
c86055	and [there is] no God besides You, according to everything
c86056	we have heard with our own ears.
c86057	And who is like Your people Israel— the one nation on earth
c86058	whom God went out
c86059	to redeem as a people for Himself,
c86060	to make a name for Yourself through great and awesome wonders
c86061	by driving out ... from before Your people,
c86062	whom You redeemed from Egypt?
c86063	nations
c86064	For You have made Your people Israel Your very own forever,
c86065	and You,
c86066	O LORD,
c86067	have become their God.
c86068	And now,
c86069	O LORD,
c86070	let the word
c86071	You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house
c86072	be established forever.
c86073	Do
c86074	as You have promised,
c86075	will be established
c86076	so that Your name ... and magnified forever
c86077	when it is said,
c86078	‘The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, is God over Israel.’
c86079	And may the house of Your servant David be established before You.
c86080	For You,
c86081	my God,
c86082	have revealed to Your servant
c86083	that You will build a house for him.
c86084	Therefore Your servant has found the courage
c86085	to pray before You.
c86086	And now,
c86087	O LORD,
c86088	You are God!
c86089	And You have promised this goodness to Your servant.
c86090	So now
c86091	You have been pleased
c86092	to bless the house of Your servant,
c86093	that it may continue forever before You.
c86094	For You,
c86095	O LORD,
c86096	have blessed it,
c86097	and [it will be] blessed forever.”
c86098	Some time later,
c86099	David defeated the Philistines,
c86100	subdued them,
c86101	and took Gath and its villages from the hand of the Philistines.
c86102	[David] also defeated the Moabites,
c86103	and they became subject to David
c86104	and brought him tribute.
c86105	[As far as] Hamath, David also defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah,
c86106	who had marched out
c86107	to establish his dominion along the Euphrates River.
c86108	David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot soldiers,
c86109	and he hamstrung all the horses
c86110	except a hundred he kept for the chariots.
c86111	When the Arameans of Damascus came
c86112	to help King Hadadezer of Zobah,
c86113	David struck down twenty-two thousand men.
c86114	Then he placed [garrisons] in Aram of Damascus,
c86115	and the Arameans became subject to David
c86116	and brought him tribute.
c86117	So the LORD made David victorious wherever
c86118	he went.
c86119	And David took the gold shields
c86120	that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer
c86121	and brought them to Jerusalem.
c86122	And from Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze,
c86123	with which Solomon made the bronze Sea, the pillars, and [various] bronze articles.
c86124	When King Tou of Hamath heard
c86125	that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
c86126	he sent his son Hadoram ... King David
c86127	to greet
c86128	and bless him
c86129	for fighting against Hadadezer
c86130	and defeating him.
c86131	For Tou and Hadadezer had been at war.
c86132	Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze,
c86133	and King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold
c86134	he had carried off from all [these] nations— from Edom and Moab, and from the Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalekites.
c86135	Moreover, Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
c86136	He placed garrisons in Edom,
c86137	and all the Edomites were subject to David.
c86138	So the LORD made David victorious wherever
c86139	he went.
c86140	Thus David reigned over all Israel,
c86141	administering justice and righteousness for all his people:
c86142	Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army;
c86143	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud [was] the historian;
c86144	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests;
c86145	Shavsha [was] the scribe;
c86146	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites;
c86147	and David’s sons were chief officials at the king’s side.
c86148	Some time later,
c86149	Nahash king of the Ammonites died
c86150	and was succeeded by his son.
c86151	And David said,
c86152	“I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash,
c86153	because his father showed kindness to me.”
c86154	So David sent messengers
c86155	to console [Hanun] concerning his father.
c86156	But when David’s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites
c86157	to console him,
c86158	the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun,
c86159	do you really believe he is showing respect for your father?
c86160	“Just because David has sent you comforters,
c86161	Have not
c86162	to explore
c86163	and overthrow it?”
c86164	the land, spy it out,
c86165	his servants come to you
c86166	So Hanun took David’s servants,
c86167	shaved [their beards],
c86168	cut their garments in half at the hips,
c86169	and sent them away.
c86170	When [someone] came
c86171	and told David about his men,
c86172	he sent
c86173	messengers to meet them,
c86174	since the men were deeply humiliated.
c86175	The king told them,
c86176	“Stay in Jericho
c86177	until your beards have grown back,
c86178	and [then] return.”
c86179	When the Ammonites realized that
c86180	they had become a stench to David,
c86181	Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver
c86182	to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah.
c86183	So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops,
c86184	who came
c86185	and camped near Medeba
c86186	while the Ammonites came from their cities and marched out
c86187	for battle.
c86188	On hearing this, David
c86189	sent Joab and the entire army of mighty men.
c86190	The Ammonites marched out
c86191	and arrayed themselves for battle at the entrance of the city,
c86192	while the kings
c86193	who had come
c86194	stayed by themselves in the open country.
c86195	When Joab saw
c86196	the battle lines before him and behind him,
c86197	he selected some of the best men of Israel
c86198	and arrayed them
c86199	against the Arameans.
c86200	And he placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai,
c86201	who arrayed them
c86202	against the Ammonites.
c86203	said Joab,
c86204	“If the Arameans are too strong for me,”
c86205	“then you will come to my rescue.
c86206	And if the Ammonites are too strong for you,
c86207	then I will come to your rescue.
c86208	Be strong
c86209	and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our God.
c86210	May the LORD
c86211	do ... in His sight.”
c86212	what is good
c86213	So Joab and his troops advanced
c86215	to fight the Arameans, ... him.
c86216	who fled before
c86217	When the Ammonites saw
c86218	that the Arameans had fled,
c86219	they too fled before Joab’s brother Abishai,
c86220	and they entered the city.
c86221	So Joab went back to Jerusalem.
c86222	When the Arameans saw
c86223	that they had been defeated by Israel,
c86224	they sent messengers
c86225	to bring [more] Arameans
c86226	from beyond the Euphrates,
c86227	with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.
c86228	When this was reported to David,
c86229	he gathered all Israel,
c86230	crossed the Jordan,
c86231	and went against
c86232	arrayed for battle against them.
c86233	When David lined up
c86234	the Arameans, ... to engage [them]
c86235	in battle,
c86236	they fought against him.
c86237	But the Arameans fled before Israel,
c86238	and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers.
c86239	He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.
c86240	When Hadadezer’s subjects saw
c86241	that they had been defeated by Israel,
c86242	they made peace with David
c86243	and became subject to him.
c86244	So the Arameans were unwilling
c86245	to help the Ammonites anymore.
c86246	In the spring, at the time when
c86247	kings march out to war,
c86248	Joab led out the army
c86249	and laid waste to the land of the Ammonites.
c86250	He came
c86251	to Rabbah and besieged it,
c86252	but David remained in Jerusalem.
c86253	Joab attacked Rabbah
c86254	and demolished it.
c86255	Then David took the crown from the head of their king.
c86256	It was found to weigh a talent of gold
c86257	and was set with precious stones,
c86258	and it was placed on David’s head.
c86259	And David took a great amount of plunder from the city.
c86260	the people
c86261	who [were] there
c86262	[David] brought out
c86263	and put [them to work] with saws, iron picks, and axes.
c86264	And [he] did the same to all the Ammonite cities.
c86265	Then [David] and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.
c86266	Some time later,
c86267	war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer.
c86268	At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim,
c86269	and the Philistines were subdued.
c86270	Once again there was a battle with the Philistines,
c86271	and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
c86272	the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
c86273	And there was still another battle at Gath,
c86274	where there was a man of [great] stature
c86275	with six fingers on each hand and six [toes on each foot]—
c86276	twenty-four in all.
c86277	He too was descended from Rapha,
c86278	and when he taunted Israel,
c86279	Jonathan the son of David’s brother Shimei killed him.
c86280	So these descendants of Rapha in Gath
c86281	fell at the hands of David and his servants.
c86282	Then Satan rose up against Israel
c86283	and incited David
c86284	to take a census of Israel.
c86285	So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, ... a report,
c86286	“Go,
c86287	count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan
c86288	and bring me
c86289	so that I may know their number.”
c86290	But Joab replied,
c86291	“May the LORD multiply His troops a hundred times over.
c86292	are they not
c86293	My lord the king,
c86294	all servants of my lord?
c86295	Why does my lord want to do this?
c86296	Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”
c86297	Nevertheless , the king's word prevailed against Joab.
c86298	So Joab left
c86299	and traveled throughout Israel,
c86300	and then he returned to Jerusalem.
c86301	And Joab reported to David the total number of the troops.
c86302	In all Israel there were 1, 100,000 men
c86303	who drew the sword,
c86304	including 470,000 in Judah.
c86306	But [Joab] did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count,
c86307	because the king’s command was detestable to him.
c86308	This command was also evil in the sight of God;
c86309	so He struck Israel.
c86310	Then David said to God,
c86311	“I have sinned greatly
c86312	because I have done this thing.
c86313	Now
c86314	I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant,
c86315	for I have acted very foolishly.”
c86316	And the LORD instructed Gad, David’s seer,
c86318	“Go
c86319	and tell David
c86320	says:
c86321	that this is what the LORD
c86322	‘I am offering you three [options].
c86323	Choose one of them,
c86324	and I will carry it out against you.’”
c86325	So Gad went ... to David,
c86326	and said
c86327	“This is what the LORD says:
c86328	‘Take your choice
c86329	of either three years of famine,
c86330	three months of being swept away before your enemies
c86331	and overtaken by their swords,
c86332	or three days of the sword of the LORD—
c86333	days of plague upon the land,
c86334	with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.’
c86335	Now then,
c86336	decide
c86337	how I should reply to Him who sent me.”
c86338	David answered Gad,
c86339	“I am deeply distressed.
c86340	Please, let me fall into the hands of the LORD,
c86341	for His mercies [are] very great;
c86342	but do not let me fall into the hands of men.”
c86343	So the LORD sent a plague on Israel,
c86344	and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.
c86345	Then God sent an angel ... Jerusalem,
c86346	to destroy
c86348	but as the angel was doing so
c86349	the LORD saw it
c86350	and relented from the calamity,
c86351	and He said to the angel who was destroying the people,
c86352	“Enough, ... now!”
c86353	withdraw your hand
c86354	At that time the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
c86355	When David lifted up his eyes
c86356	and saw the angel of the LORD
c86357	standing between heaven and earth,
c86358	with his drawn sword in his hand
c86359	stretched out over Jerusalem,
c86360	David and the elders, ... fell
c86361	clothed in sackcloth,
c86362	facedown,
c86363	and David said to God,
c86364	“Was it not I who gave the order
c86365	to count the people?
c86366	I, [the shepherd], am the one
c86367	who has sinned
c86368	and acted wickedly.
c86369	But these sheep,
c86370	what have they done?
c86371	O LORD my God,
c86372	please let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house,
c86373	but do not let this plague remain upon Your people.”
c86374	Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad
c86375	to tell David
c86376	to go up
c86377	and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
c86378	So David went up at the word that Gad
c86379	had spoken in the name of the LORD.
c86380	Now Ornan ... turned
c86381	and saw the angel;
c86382	and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
c86383	was threshing wheat when he
c86384	David came to Ornan,
c86385	and when Ornan looked out
c86386	and saw David,
c86387	he left the threshing floor
c86388	and bowed ... before David.
c86389	facedown
c86390	Then David said to Ornan,
c86391	“Grant me the site of this threshing floor,
c86392	that I may build an altar to the LORD.
c86393	Sell it to me for the full price,
c86394	so that the plague on the people may be halted.”
c86395	Ornan said to David,
c86396	may take
c86397	“My lord the king ... whatever [seems] good.
c86399	Look,
c86400	I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings,
c86401	the threshing sledges for the wood,
c86402	and the wheat for the grain offering—
c86403	I will give it all.”
c86404	replied King David,
c86405	“No,”
c86406	“I insist on paying the full price, for
c86407	I will not take
c86408	what belongs to you
c86409	for the LORD
c86410	or offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”
c86411	So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold for the site.
c86412	And there he built an altar to the LORD
c86413	and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
c86414	He called upon the LORD,
c86415	who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
c86416	Then the LORD spoke to the angel,
c86417	who put his sword back into its sheath.
c86418	At that time,
c86419	when David saw
c86420	that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite,
c86421	he offered sacrifices there.
c86422	For the tabernacle of the LORD
c86423	that Moses had made in the wilderness
c86424	and the altar of burnt offering were presently at the high place in Gibeon,
c86425	but David could not
c86426	go before it
c86427	to inquire of God,
c86428	because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
c86429	Then David said,
c86430	“This
c86431	is the house of the LORD God,
c86432	and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”
c86433	So David gave orders
c86434	to gather the foreigners
c86435	in the land of Israel,
c86436	from whom he appointed stonecutters
c86437	to prepare finished stones
c86438	for building the house of God.
c86439	David provided a large quantity of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings,
c86440	together with more bronze
c86441	than could be weighed
c86442	and more cedar logs than could be counted;
c86443	for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large quantity of cedar logs to David.
c86444	And David said,
c86445	“My son Solomon is young and inexperienced,
c86446	and the house
c86447	to be built for the LORD
c86448	must be exceedingly magnificent— famous and glorious throughout all the lands.
c86449	Therefore I must make provision for it.”
c86450	So David made lavish preparations for it before his death.
c86451	Then [David] called for his son Solomon
c86452	and instructed
c86453	him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.
c86454	said David to Solomon,
c86455	“My son,”
c86457	“it was in my heart
c86458	to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God,
c86459	but this word of the LORD came to me:
c86461	‘You have shed much blood
c86462	and waged great wars.
c86463	You are not to build a house for My Name
c86464	because you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me.
c86465	But a son will be born to you
c86466	who will be a man of rest.
c86467	I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side;
c86468	for his name will be Solomon,
c86469	and I will grant to Israel peace and quiet during his reign.
c86470	He is the one who will build a house for My Name.
c86471	He will be My son,
c86472	and I [will be] his Father.
c86473	And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’
c86474	Now,
c86475	my son,
c86476	may the LORD be with you,
c86477	and may you succeed
c86478	in building the house of the LORD your God,
c86479	as He said you would.
c86480	Above all, may the LORD give you insight and understanding
c86481	when He puts you in command over Israel,
c86482	so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
c86483	Then you will succeed,
c86484	if you carefully
c86485	follow the statutes and ordinances
c86486	that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel.
c86487	Be strong
c86488	and courageous.
c86489	Do not be afraid
c86490	or discouraged.
c86491	Now behold,
c86492	I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the LORD— 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver,
c86493	and bronze and iron ... to be weighed.
c86494	too great
c86495	I have also provided timber and stone,
c86496	but you will need to add to them.
c86497	You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and men skilled in every kind of work—
c86498	in gold and silver, bronze and iron— [craftsmen] beyond number.
c86499	Now begin
c86500	the work,
c86501	and may the LORD be with you.”
c86502	Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel
c86503	to help his son Solomon:
c86504	“[Is] not the LORD your God with you,
c86505	and has He not granted you rest on every side?
c86506	For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand,
c86507	and the land has been subdued before the LORD and His people.
c86508	Now set your heart and soul
c86509	to seek the LORD your God.
c86510	Get started
c86511	building the sanctuary of the LORD God,
c86512	so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the temple
c86513	that will be built for the Name of the LORD.”
c86514	When David was old
c86515	and full of years,
c86516	he installed his son Solomon as king over Israel.
c86517	Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites.
c86518	The Levites thirty years of age and older were counted,
c86519	and the total number of men was 38,000.
c86520	“Of these,”
c86521	are to oversee the work of the house of the LORD,
c86522	said David,“ 24,000
c86523	6,000 are to be officers and judges,
c86524	4,000 are to be gatekeepers,
c86525	and 4,000 are to praise the LORD with the instruments
c86526	I have made
c86527	for giving praise.”
c86528	Then David divided [the Levites] into divisions
c86529	according to the sons of Levi: Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.
c86530	The Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
c86531	The sons of Ladan:
c86532	Jehiel was the first,
c86533	then Zetham, and Joel—
c86534	three [in all].
c86535	The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran— three [in all].
c86536	These [were] the heads of the families of Ladan.
c86537	And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah.
c86538	These [were] the sons of Shimei— four [in all].
c86539	Jahath was the first
c86540	and Zizah was the second;
c86541	but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons,
c86542	so they were counted as one family and received a single assignment.
c86543	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel— four [in all].
c86544	The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses.
c86545	Aaron, ... was set apart
c86546	to consecrate the most holy things,
c86547	along with his descendants,
c86548	forever
c86549	to burn incense before the LORD,
c86550	to minister before Him,
c86551	and to pronounce blessings in His name forever.
c86552	As for Moses the man of God,
c86553	his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
c86554	The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
c86555	The descendants of Gershom:
c86556	Shebuel was the first.
c86557	The descendants of Eliezer: ... was
c86558	Rehabiah ... the first.
c86559	Eliezer did not have any other sons,
c86560	but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
c86561	The sons of Izhar:
c86562	Shelomith was first.
c86563	The sons of Hebron:
c86564	Jeriah was first,
c86565	Amariah the second,
c86566	Jahaziel the third,
c86567	and Jekameam the fourth.
c86568	The sons of Uzziel:
c86569	Micah was first
c86570	and Isshiah second.
c86571	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
c86572	The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
c86573	Eleazar died
c86574	without having [any] sons;
c86575	he had only daughters.
c86576	Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
c86577	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth— three [in all].
c86578	These were the descendants of Levi by their families— the heads of families, registered individually by name—
c86579	who worked in the service of the house of the LORD.
c86580	those twenty years of age or older
c86581	For David had said,
c86582	“The LORD, the God of Israel, has given rest to His people
c86583	and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever.
c86584	So now the Levites no
c86585	longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles for its service.”
c86586	For according to the final instructions of David, the Levites twenty years of age or older were counted,
c86587	but their duty was to assist the descendants of Aaron with the service of the house of the LORD, being responsible for the courts and chambers,
c86588	the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God,
c86589	as well as for the rows of the showbread, the fine flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baking, the mixing, and all measurements of volume and size.
c86590	They were also to stand every morning
c86591	to give thanks
c86592	and praise to the LORD,
c86593	and likewise in the evening.
c86594	Whenever
c86595	burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts, they were to serve regularly before the LORD in the numbers prescribed for them.
c86596	So [the Levites] were to carry out the responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting and the Holy Place, and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, the service of the house of the LORD.
c86597	[These were] the divisions of the descendants of Aaron.
c86598	The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
c86599	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did,
c86600	and they had no sons;
c86601	so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
c86602	David divided them
c86603	With the help of Eleazar's descendant Zadok and Ithamar's descendant Ahimelech,
c86604	according to the offices of their service.
c86605	were found among Eleazar's descendants
c86606	Since more leaders ... than [those] of Ithamar,
c86607	they were divided accordingly.
c86608	[There were] sixteen heads of families from the descendants of Eleazar
c86609	and eight from the descendants of Ithamar.
c86610	Thus they were divided by lot,
c86612	for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants.
c86613	The secretary, Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded [their names] in the presence of the king and the officers Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites—
c86614	one family being taken from Eleazar,
c86615	and then one from Ithamar.
c86616	The first lot fell to Jehoiarib,
c86617	the second to Jedaiah,
c86618	the third to Harim,
c86619	the fourth to Seorim,
c86620	the fifth to Malchijah,
c86621	the sixth to Mijamin,
c86622	the seventh to Hakkoz,
c86623	the eighth to Abijah,
c86624	the ninth to Jeshua,
c86625	the tenth to Shecaniah,
c86626	the eleventh to Eliashib,
c86627	the twelfth to Jakim,
c86628	the thirteenth to Huppah,
c86629	the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
c86630	the fifteenth to Bilgah,
c86631	the sixteenth to Immer,
c86632	the seventeenth to Hezir,
c86633	the eighteenth to Happizzez,
c86634	the nineteenth to Pethahiah,
c86635	the twentieth to Jehezkel,
c86636	the twenty-first to Jachin,
c86637	the twenty-second to Gamul,
c86638	the twenty-third to Delaiah,
c86639	and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
c86640	This was their appointed order for service
c86641	when they entered the house of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their forefather Aaron,
c86642	as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him.
c86643	descendants of Levi:
c86644	Now [these were] the remaining
c86645	From the sons of Amram: Shubael;
c86646	from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah.
c86647	As for Rehabiah, from his sons:
c86648	The first [was] Isshiah.
c86649	From the Izharites: Shelomoth;
c86650	from the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath.
c86651	From the sons [of Hebron]: Jeriah [was the first],
c86652	Amariah the second,
c86653	Jahaziel the third,
c86654	[and] Jekameam the fourth.
c86655	[From] the sons of Uzziel: Micah;
c86656	from the sons of Micah: Shamir.
c86657	The brother of Micah: Isshiah;
c86658	from the sons of Isshiah: Zechariah.
c86659	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
c86660	The son of Jaaziah: Beno.
c86661	The descendants of Merari from Jaaziah: Beno,
c86662	Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
c86663	From Mahli: Eleazar,
c86664	who had no sons.
c86665	From Kish:
c86666	Jerahmeel the son of Kish.
c86667	And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.
c86668	These were the sons of the Levites, according to their families.
c86669	As their brothers the descendants of Aaron did, they also cast lots in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the families of the priests and Levites—
c86670	the family heads and their younger brothers alike.
c86671	Additionally, David and the commanders of the army set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun ... this service:
c86672	to prophesy with the accompaniment of lyres, harps, and cymbals.
c86673	The following is the list of the men who performed
c86674	From the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah.
c86675	These sons of Asaph [were] under the direction of Asaph,

c86778	These divisions of the gatekeepers, through their chief men, had duties ... just as their brothers did.
c86779	for ministering in the house of the LORD,
c86780	They cast lots for each gate, according to their families, young and old alike.
c86781	The lot for the East [Gate] fell to Shelemiah.
c86782	for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor,
c86783	Then lots were cast
c86784	and the lot for the north gate fell to him.
c86785	[The lot for] the South [Gate] [fell] to Obed-edom,
c86786	and the lot for the storehouses to his sons.

c86796	These [were] the divisions of the gatekeepers who were descendants of Korah [and] Merari.

c86819	Hashabiah and his relatives, 1,700 capable men, had charge of the affairs of Israel west of the Jordan for all the work of the LORD and for the service of the king.
c86820	As for the Hebronites,
c86821	Jerijah was the chief of the Hebronites, according to the genealogies of his ancestors.
c86822	In the fortieth year of David’s reign [the records] were searched,
c86823	and strong, capable men were found among [the Hebronites] at Jazer in Gilead.
c86824	Among Jerijah’s relatives [there were] 2,700 capable men who were heads of families.
c86825	King David appointed them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every matter [pertaining to] God and the affairs of the king.

c86876	These [were] the leaders of the tribes of Israel.
c86877	David did not count the men aged twenty or under,
c86878	because the LORD had said that
c86879	He would make Israel as numerous as the stars of the sky.
c86880	Joab son of Zeruiah began
c86881	to count [the men]
c86882	but did not finish.
c86883	came
c86884	For this was the reason wrath ... upon Israel,
c86885	and the number was not entered in the Book of the Chronicles of King David.

c86904	All these were officials ... property.
c86905	in charge of King David’s

c86907	he was a man of insight and a scribe.
c86908	Jehiel son of Hachmoni attended the king’s sons.
c86909	Ahithophel was the king’s counselor.
c86910	Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend.
c86911	Ahithophel was succeeded by Jehoiada son of Benaiah, then by Abiathar.
c86912	Joab was the commander of the king’s army.
c86913	Now David summoned all the leaders of Israel ... the leaders of the tribes, the leaders of the divisions
c86914	in the king’s service,
c86915	to Jerusalem: ... the commanders of thousands [and] of hundreds, and the officials in charge of all the property and cattle of the king and his sons, along with the court officials, the fighting men, and all the mighty warriors.
c86916	Then King David rose to his feet
c86917	and said,
c86918	“Listen to me,
c86919	my brothers and my people.
c86920	It was in my heart
c86921	to build a house as a resting place for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and as a footstool for our God.
c86922	I had made preparations
c86923	to build it,
c86924	but God said to me,
c86925	‘You are not to build a house for My Name,
c86926	because you are a man of war
c86927	who has spilled blood.’
c86928	Yet the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me out of all my father’s house
c86929	to be king over Israel forever.
c86930	For He chose Judah as leader,
c86931	and from the house of Judah [He chose] my father’s household,
c86932	and from my father’s sons He was pleased
c86933	to make me king over all Israel.
c86934	And of all my sons—
c86935	for the LORD has given me many sons—
c86936	He has chosen Solomon my son
c86937	to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
c86938	And He said to me,
c86939	‘Solomon your son
c86940	is the one who will build My house and My courts,
c86941	for I have chosen him [as] My son,
c86942	and I will be his Father.
c86943	I will establish his kingdom forever,
c86944	if he resolutely
c86945	carries out My commandments and ordinances, as is being done this day.’
c86946	So now
c86947	in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God,
c86948	observe
c86949	and seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God,
c86950	so that you may possess this good land
c86951	and leave it as an inheritance to your descendants forever.
c86952	As for you,
c86953	Solomon my son,
c86954	know the God of your father
c86955	and serve Him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind,
c86956	for the LORD searches every heart
c86957	and understands the intention of every thought.
c86958	If you seek Him,
c86959	He will be found by you;
c86960	but if you forsake Him,
c86961	He will reject you forever.
c86962	Consider now
c86963	that the LORD has chosen you
c86964	to build a house for the sanctuary.
c86965	Be strong
c86966	and do it.”
c86967	Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico [of the temple], its buildings, storehouses, upper rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the mercy seat.
c86968	The plans contained everything
c86969	he had in mind for the courts of the house of the LORD, for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God [and] of the dedicated things,
c86970	for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of service in the house of the LORD, and for all the articles of service in the house of the LORD:
c86971	the weight of all the gold articles for every kind of service;
c86972	the weight of all the silver articles for every kind of service;
c86973	the weight of the gold lampstands and their lamps, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps;
c86974	the weight of each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand;
c86975	the weight of gold for each table of showbread, ... tables;
c86976	and of silver for the silver
c86977	[the weight of] the pure gold for the forks, sprinkling basins, and pitchers;
c86978	the weight of each gold dish; ... bowl;
c86979	the weight of each silver
c86980	the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense;
c86981	and the plans for the chariot of the gold cherubim
c86982	that spread [their wings]
c86983	and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
c86984	“All this,” [said David],
c86985	“all the details of this plan, the LORD made clear to me in writing by [His] hand upon me.”
c86986	David also said to Solomon his son,
c86987	“Be strong
c86988	and courageous,
c86989	and do [it].
c86990	Do not be afraid
c86991	or discouraged,
c86992	for the LORD God, my God, is with you.
c86993	He will not fail you
c86994	or forsake you
c86995	until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished.
c86996	are ready
c86997	The divisions of the priests and the Levites ... for all the service of the house of God,
c86998	[and] every willing man of every skill will be at your disposal for the work. ... and all
c86999	The officials ... the people are fully at your command.”
c87000	Then King David said to the whole assembly,
c87001	“My son Solomon,
c87002	whom alone God has chosen,
c87003	is young
c87004	and inexperienced.
c87005	The task is great
c87006	because this palace will not be for man,
c87007	but for the LORD God.
c87008	Now with all my ability I have made provision for the house of my God— gold for the gold articles,
c87009	silver for the silver,
c87010	bronze for the bronze,
c87011	iron for the iron,
c87012	and wood for the wood,
c87013	as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and slabs of marble— all in abundance.
c87014	Moreover,
c87015	because of my delight in the house of my God,
c87016	my personal treasures
c87017	I now give for [it] ... of gold and silver, over and above all
c87018	that I have provided for this holy temple:
c87019	three thousand talents of gold (the gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents of refined silver,
c87020	to overlay the walls of the buildings,
c87021	for the gold work
c87022	and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen.
c87023	Now who will volunteer
c87024	to consecrate himself to the LORD today?”
c87025	Then the leaders of the households, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave willingly.
c87026	Toward the service of God’s house they gave 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze, and 100,000 talents of iron.
c87028	Whoever had precious stones
c87029	gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
c87030	Then the people rejoiced
c87031	at the willing response of their leaders,
c87032	for they had given to the LORD freely and wholeheartedly.
c87033	And King David also rejoiced greatly.
c87034	Then David blessed the LORD in the sight of all the assembly
c87035	[and] said:
c87036	“May You be blessed,
c87037	O LORD, God of our father Israel,
c87038	from everlasting to everlasting.
c87039	Yours,
c87040	O LORD,
c87041	is the greatness and the power and the glory and the splendor and the majesty,
c87042	for everything in heaven and on earth belongs to You. Yours,
c87043	O LORD,
c87044	is the kingdom,
c87045	and You are exalted as head over all.
c87046	Both riches and honor come from You,
c87047	and You are the ruler over all.
c87048	Power and might are in Your hand,
c87049	and it is in Your hand
c87050	to exalt
c87051	and to give strength to all.
c87052	Now therefore,
c87053	our God,
c87054	we give You thanks,
c87055	and we praise Your glorious name.
c87056	But who am I, ... that
c87057	and who are my people,
c87058	we should be able ... For
c87059	to give as generously as this?
c87060	everything
c87061	comes from You, and from Your own hand we have given to You.
c87062	For we [are] foreigners ... in Your presence,
c87063	and sojourners ... as were all our forefathers.
c87064	Our days on earth are like a shadow,
c87065	without hope.
c87066	O LORD our God,
c87067	all this abundance
c87068	that we have provided
c87069	for building You a house for Your holy Name,
c87070	from Your hand comes
c87071	and all of it belongs to You.
c87072	I know,
c87073	my God,
c87074	that You test the heart
c87075	and delight in uprightness.
c87076	All these things I have given willingly and with an upright heart,
c87077	and now
c87078	Your people
c87079	who are present here
c87080	I have seen ... giving joyfully
c87081	and willingly to You.
c87082	O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
c87083	keep this desire forever in the intentions of the hearts of Your people,
c87084	and direct their hearts toward You.
c87085	And give my son Solomon a whole heart
c87086	to keep ... Your commandments, decrees, and statutes,
c87087	and carry out all
c87088	and to build [Your] palace
c87089	for which I have made provision.”
c87090	Then David said to the whole assembly,
c87091	“Praise the LORD your God.”
c87092	So the whole assembly praised the LORD, the God of their fathers.
c87093	They bowed down
c87094	and paid homage to the LORD and to the king.
c87095	they offered sacrifices
c87096	The next day ... and presented burnt offerings to the LORD:
c87097	a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, along with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance
c87098	for all Israel.
c87099	they ate
c87100	That day ... and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD.
c87101	Then, for a second time, they designated David’s son Solomon as king,
c87102	anointing him before the LORD as ruler,
c87103	and Zadok as the priest.
c87104	So Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of his father David.
c87105	He prospered,
c87106	and all Israel obeyed him.
c87107	All the officials and mighty men, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
c87108	The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel
c87109	and bestowed on him royal majesty
c87110	such as had not been bestowed on any king in Israel before him.
c87111	David son of Jesse was king over all Israel.
c87112	The length
c87113	of David's reign over Israel
c87114	[was] forty years—
c87115	seven years in Hebron
c87116	and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
c87117	He died at a ripe old age, full of days, riches, and honor,
c87118	and his son Solomon became king in his place.
c87119	Now the acts of King David, from first to last,
c87120	they are indeed written in the Chronicles of Samuel the Seer, the Chronicles of Nathan the Prophet, and the Chronicles of Gad the Seer,
c87121	together with all the details of his reign, his might, and the circumstances
c87122	that came upon him [and] Israel [and] all the kingdoms of the lands.
c87123	Now Solomon son of David established himself securely over his kingdom,
c87124	and the LORD his God was with him
c87125	and highly exalted him.
c87126	Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel— the heads of the families.
c87127	And Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place
c87128	at Gibeon
c87129	because it was the location of God’s Tent of Meeting,
c87130	which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
c87131	Now David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim
c87132	to the place he had prepared for it,
c87133	because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
c87134	But the bronze altar
c87135	made by Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur,
c87136	was [in Gibeon] before the tabernacle of the LORD.
c87137	So Solomon and the assembly inquired of Him there.
c87138	Solomon offered sacrifices there before the LORD on the bronze altar
c87139	at the Tent of Meeting;
c87140	on it he offered a thousand burnt offerings.
c87141	That night God appeared to Solomon
c87142	and said,
c87143	“Ask,
c87144	[and] I will give it to you!”
c87145	Solomon replied to God:
c87146	“You have shown great and loving devotion to my father David,
c87147	and You have made me king in his place.
c87148	Now,
c87149	O LORD God,
c87150	let Your promise to my father David be fulfilled.
c87151	For You have made me king over a people
c87152	as numerous as the dust of the earth.
c87153	Now
c87154	grant me wisdom and knowledge,
c87155	so that I may lead this people.
c87157	For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?”
c87158	God said to Solomon,
c87159	“Since this was in your heart
c87160	and you have not requested riches or wealth or glory
c87161	or the death of your enemies—
c87162	and since you have not even requested long life
c87163	but have asked for wisdom and knowledge
c87164	to govern My people
c87165	over whom I have made you king—
c87166	therefore wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you.
c87167	And I will also give you riches and wealth and honor
c87168	unlike anything given to the kings
c87169	before you
c87170	[or] after you.”
c87171	So Solomon went ... from the high place
c87172	in Gibeon
c87173	to Jerusalem
c87174	before the Tent of Meeting,
c87175	and he reigned over Israel.
c87176	Solomon accumulated ... chariots ... horses,
c87177	1,400 ... and 12,000 ... which he stationed in the chariot
c87178	cities and also with [him] in Jerusalem.
c87179	The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones,
c87180	and cedar ... as sycamore
c87181	as abundant ... in the foothills.
c87182	horses were imported
c87183	Solomon’s
c87184	from Egypt and Kue;
c87185	the royal merchants purchased them in Kue.
c87186	could be imported
c87187	A chariot ... from Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver,
c87188	and a horse for a hundred and fifty.
c87189	Likewise, ... to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram.
c87190	[they] exported them
c87191	Now Solomon purposed
c87192	to build a house for the Name of the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
c87193	So he conscripted 70,000 porters, 80,000
c87194	stonecutters in the mountains,
c87195	and 3,600 supervisors.
c87196	Then Solomon sent word to King Hiram of Tyre:
c87198	“Do for me as you did for my father David
c87199	when you sent him cedars
c87200	to build himself a house
c87201	to live in.
c87202	Behold, I am about to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God
c87203	to dedicate to Him
c87204	for burning fragrant incense before Him, for displaying the showbread continuously, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening as well as on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts of the LORD our God.
c87205	This is ordained for Israel forever.
c87206	The house
c87207	that I am building
c87208	will be great,
c87209	for our God is greater than all gods.
c87210	But who is able
c87211	to build a house for Him,
c87212	since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain Him?
c87213	Who then am I,
c87214	that I should build a house for Him,
c87215	except [as a place] to burn sacrifices before Him?
c87216	therefore,
c87217	Send me, ... a craftsman
c87218	to work with gold and silver, bronze and iron, purple, crimson, and blue yarn.
c87219	who is skilled
c87220	in engraving ... He will work with my craftsmen
c87221	in Judah and Jerusalem,
c87222	whom my father David provided.
c87223	Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum logs from Lebanon,
c87224	for I know
c87225	that your servants have skill
c87226	to cut timber [there].
c87227	And indeed, my servants will work with yours
c87228	to prepare for me timber in abundance,
c87229	because the temple
c87230	I am building
c87231	will be great and wonderful.
c87232	I will pay your servants, the woodcutters, 20,000 cors of ground wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths of wine, and20,000 baths of olive oil.”
c87233	Then King Hiram of Tyre wrote a letter
c87234	in reply to Solomon:
c87235	“Because the LORD loves His people, He has set you over them as king.”
c87236	Hiram also said:
c87237	“Blessed [be] the LORD, the God of Israel,
c87238	who made the heavens and the earth!
c87239	He has given King David a wise son
c87240	with insight and understanding,
c87241	who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
c87242	So now I
c87243	am sending you ... a skillful man
c87244	endowed with understanding.
c87245	Huram-abi,
c87246	He is the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan,
c87247	and his father is a man of Tyre.
c87248	He is skilled
c87249	in work with gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple, blue, and crimson yarn, and fine linen.
c87250	He is experienced in every kind of engraving
c87251	and can execute any design
c87252	that is given him.
c87253	He will work with your craftsmen and with those of my lord, your father David.
c87254	Now
c87255	the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine
c87256	let my lord ... he promised.
c87257	send to his servants
c87258	We will cut logs from Lebanon, as many as you need,
c87259	and in rafts by sea we will bring them to you at Joppa.
c87260	Then you can take them up to Jerusalem.”
c87261	Solomon numbered all the foreign men
c87262	in the land of Israel,
c87263	following the census
c87264	his father David [had conducted],
c87265	and there were found to be 153,600[in all].
c87266	Solomon made 70,000of them porters,
c87267	80,000 stonecutters in the mountains,
c87268	and 3,600 supervisors.
c87270	Then Solomon began
c87271	to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah,
c87272	where [the LORD] had appeared to his father David.
c87273	[This was] the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
c87274	[Solomon] began
c87275	construction on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
c87276	The foundation that Solomon
c87277	laid for the house of God
c87278	[was] sixty cubits long ... according to the old standard.
c87279	and twenty cubits wide,
c87280	The portico
c87281	at the front, extending across the width of the temple,
c87282	[was] twenty cubits [long]
c87283	[and] twenty [cubits] high.
c87284	He overlaid the inside with pure gold.
c87285	He paneled the main room with cypress,
c87286	which he overlaid with fine gold
c87287	and decorated with palm tree and chain [designs].
c87288	He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty,
c87289	and its gold [was] from Parvaim.
c87290	He overlaid [its] beams, thresholds, walls, and doors with gold,
c87291	and he carved cherubim on the walls.
c87292	Then he made the Most Holy Place;
c87293	its length corresponded to the width of the temple, twenty cubits [long]
c87294	and twenty cubits wide,
c87295	and he overlaid [the inside] with six hundred talents of fine gold.
c87296	The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold.
c87297	He also overlaid the upper area with gold.
c87298	In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim of sculptured work,
c87299	and he overlaid them with gold.
c87300	wingspan of the cherubim
c87301	The total ... [was] twenty cubits.
c87302	One wing of the first [cherub] [was] five cubits [long]
c87303	and touched the wall of the temple,
c87304	and [its] other wing [was] five cubits [long]
c87305	and touched the wing of the other cherub.
c87306	The wing of the second cherub [also measured] five cubits
c87307	and touched the wall of the house,
c87308	while [its] other wing [measured] five cubits
c87309	and touched the wing of the first cherub.
c87310	So the total wingspan of these cherubim [was] twenty cubits.
c87311	They stood on their feet,
c87312	facing the [main] room.
c87313	He made the veil of blue, purple, and crimson yarn and fine linen,
c87314	with cherubim woven into it.
c87315	In front of the temple he made two pillars,
c87316	which [together] were thirty-five cubits high,
c87317	each with a capital
c87318	on top
c87319	[measuring] five cubits.
c87320	He made interwoven chains
c87321	and put them on top of the pillars.
c87322	He made a hundred pomegranates
c87323	and fastened them into the chainwork.
c87324	Then he set up the pillars in front of the temple,
c87325	one on the south
c87326	and one ... and the [pillar] on the north
c87327	[The pillar] on the south he named Jachin,
c87328	on the north. ... he named Boaz.
c87329	He made a bronze altar
c87330	twenty cubits long,
c87331	twenty cubits wide,
c87332	and ten cubits high.
c87333	He also made the Sea of cast metal.
c87334	measuring ten cubits from rim to [rim],
c87335	[It was] circular in shape,
c87336	five cubits in height,
c87337	and thirty cubits in circumference.
c87338	Below [the rim], figures of oxen encircled
c87339	it,
c87340	ten per cubit all the way around the Sea,
c87341	cast in two rows as a part of [the Sea].
c87342	[The Sea] stood on twelve oxen,
c87343	three facing north,
c87344	three facing west,
c87345	three facing south,
c87346	and three facing east.
c87347	[The Sea] rested on them
c87348	with all their hindquarters toward the center.
c87349	It was a handbreadth thick,
c87350	and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup,
c87351	like a lily blossom.
c87352	It could hold three thousand baths.
c87353	He also made ten basins
c87354	and placed five on the south side
c87355	and five on the north.
c87356	for washing
c87357	The parts of the burnt offering were rinsed in them,
c87358	the Sea
c87359	but the priests [used] ... for washing.
c87360	He made ten gold lampstands according to their specifications
c87361	and placed [them] in the temple, five on the south side
c87362	and five on the north.
c87363	Additionally, he made ten tables
c87364	and placed [them] in the temple, five on the south side
c87365	and five on the north.
c87366	He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls.
c87367	He made the courtyard of the priests and the large court and doors for the court,
c87368	and he overlaid the doors with bronze.
c87369	He put the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.
c87370	In addition, Huram made the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls.
c87371	So Huram finished
c87372	the work
c87373	that he had undertaken for King Solomon in the house of God:
c87374	the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars; the two sets of network
c87375	covering both bowls of the capitals
c87376	atop the pillars;
c87377	the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network
c87378	(two rows of pomegranates for each network
c87379	covering both the bowl-shaped capitals
c87380	atop the pillars);
c87381	the stands;
c87382	the basins on the stands;
c87383	the Sea; the twelve oxen underneath [the Sea];
c87384	and the pots, shovels, meat forks, and all the other articles. [All these objects that] Huram-abi made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD were of polished bronze.
c87385	The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zeredah.
c87386	Solomon made all these articles in such great abundance
c87387	that the weight of the bronze could not be determined.
c87388	Solomon also made all the furnishings
c87389	for the house of God:
c87390	the golden altar; the tables
c87391	on which was placed the Bread of the Presence;
c87392	the lampstands ... and their lamps,
c87393	to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed;
c87394	of pure gold
c87395	the flowers, lamps, and tongs of gold—
c87396	of purest gold;
c87397	the wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, ladles, and censers of purest gold;
c87398	and the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the Most Holy Place as well as the doors of the main hall.
c87399	So all the work ... was completed.
c87400	that Solomon had performed for the house of the LORD
c87401	Then Solomon brought the consecrated items of his father David—
c87402	the silver, the gold, and all the furnishings— and he placed them in the treasuries of the house of God.
c87403	At that time Solomon assembled at Jerusalem the elders of Israel— all the tribal heads and family leaders of the Israelites—
c87404	to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD ... the City of David.
c87405	from Zion,
c87406	So all the men of Israel came together to the king at the feast
c87407	in the seventh month.
c87408	When all the elders of Israel had arrived,
c87409	the Levites took up the ark,
c87410	and they brought up the ark and the Tent of Meeting with all ... sacred furnishings.
c87411	[its]
c87412	The Levitical priests carried them up.
c87413	King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel
c87414	There, before the ark, ... who had assembled with him
c87415	sacrificed ... sheep and oxen
c87416	that they could not be counted
c87417	so many ... or numbered.
c87418	Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
c87419	For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark
c87420	and overshadowed the ark and its poles.
c87421	The poles were so long
c87422	that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary,
c87423	but not from outside [the Holy Place];
c87424	and they are there to this day.
c87425	[There was] nothing in the ark except the two tablets
c87426	that Moses had placed in it at Horeb,
c87427	where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites
c87428	after they had come out of Egypt.
c87429	And when
c87430	the priests came out of the Holy Place,
c87431	Now all the priests
c87432	who were present
c87433	had consecrated themselves
c87434	regardless of
c87435	their divisions.
c87436	the Levitical
c87437	all ... singers— Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives—
c87438	dressed in fine linen
c87439	stood on the east side of the altar, ... and playing cymbals, harps, and lyres,
c87440	accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.
c87441	The trumpeters and singers joined together
c87442	with one voice.
c87443	to praise
c87444	and thank the LORD
c87445	They raised their voices, accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments,
c87446	in praise to the LORD:
c87447	“For He is good;
c87448	His loving devotion endures forever.”
c87449	Then the temple, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud
c87450	so that the priests could not
c87451	stand there
c87452	to minister because of the cloud;
c87453	for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
c87454	Then Solomon said:
c87455	“The LORD said
c87456	that He would dwell in the thick cloud;
c87457	and I have built You an exalted house,
c87458	a place
c87459	for You to dwell forever.”
c87460	the king turned around
c87461	and blessed [them] all
c87462	And as the whole assembly of Israel stood [there],
c87463	and said:
c87464	“Blessed [be] the LORD, the God of Israel,
c87465	[who] ... what He spoke with His mouth to my father David,
c87466	has fulfilled with His own hand
c87467	saying,
c87468	‘Since the day
c87469	I brought My people out of Egypt,
c87470	I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel
c87471	[in which] to build a house
c87472	so that My Name would be there,
c87473	nor have I chosen anyone
c87474	to be ruler over My people Israel.
c87475	But I have chosen Jerusalem
c87476	so that My Name will be there,
c87477	and I have chosen David
c87478	to be over My people Israel.’
c87479	Now it was in the heart of my father David
c87480	to build a house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
c87481	But the LORD said to my father David,
c87482	‘Since it was in your heart
c87483	to build a house for My Name,
c87484	you have done well
c87485	to have this in your heart.
c87486	Nevertheless, you are not the one to build [it];
c87487	but your son,
c87488	your own offspring,
c87489	will build the house for My Name.’
c87490	Now the LORD has fulfilled the word
c87491	that He spoke.
c87492	I have succeeded my father David,
c87493	and I sit on the throne of Israel,
c87494	as the LORD promised.
c87495	I have built the house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
c87496	And there I have provided a place for the ark,
c87497	which contains the covenant of the LORD that
c87498	He made with the children of Israel.”
c87499	Then [Solomon] stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel
c87500	and spread out his hands.
c87501	Now Solomon had made a bronze platform
c87502	and had placed it in the middle of the courtyard.
c87503	five cubits long,
c87504	five cubits wide,
c87505	and three cubits high,
c87506	He stood on it,
c87507	knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel,
c87508	spread out his hands toward heaven,
c87509	and said:
c87510	“O LORD, God of Israel,
c87511	there is no God like You in heaven or on earth,
c87512	keeping [Your] covenant of loving devotion with Your servants
c87513	who walk before You with all their hearts.
c87514	You have kept ... to Your servant, my father David.
c87515	Your promise
c87516	What You spoke with Your mouth
c87517	You have fulfilled with Your hand this day.
c87518	Therefore now,
c87519	O LORD, God of Israel,
c87520	keep for Your servant, my father David,
c87521	what You promised
c87522	when You said:
c87523	‘You will never fail to have a man ... before Me
c87524	to sit ... on the throne of Israel,
c87525	if only your descendants guard their way
c87526	to walk in My Law
c87527	as you have walked before Me.’
c87528	And now,
c87529	O LORD, God of Israel,
c87530	please confirm
c87531	what You promised to Your servant David.
c87532	But will God indeed dwell with man upon the earth?
c87533	Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You,
c87534	much less this temple
c87535	I have built.
c87536	Yet regard the prayer and plea of Your servant,
c87537	O LORD my God,
c87538	so that You may hear the cry and the prayer
c87539	that Your servant is praying before You.
c87540	May Your eyes be open toward this temple day and night,
c87541	toward the place
c87542	of which You said
c87543	You would put Your Name there,
c87544	so that You may hear the prayer ... toward
c87545	that Your servant prays ... this place.
c87546	Hear the plea of Your servant and Your people Israel ... toward
c87547	when they pray ... this place.
c87548	May You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place.
c87549	May You hear
c87550	and forgive.
c87551	When a man sins against his neighbor
c87552	and is required to take an oath,
c87553	to take an oath
c87554	and he comes ... before Your altar in this temple,
c87555	may You hear from heaven
c87556	and act.
c87557	May You judge Your servants,
c87558	condemning the wicked man
c87559	by bringing down on his own head what he has done,
c87560	and justifying the righteous man
c87561	by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
c87562	When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy
c87563	because they have sinned against You, ... to You
c87564	and they return
c87565	and confess Your name,
c87566	praying
c87567	and pleading before You in this house,
c87568	may You hear from heaven
c87569	and forgive the sin of Your people Israel.
c87570	May You restore them to the land
c87571	You gave to them and their fathers.
c87572	When the skies are shut
c87573	and there is no rain
c87574	because [Your people] have sinned against You,
c87575	and they pray toward this place
c87576	and confess Your name,
c87577	and they turn from their sins
c87578	because You have afflicted them,
c87579	may You hear from heaven
c87580	and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel,
c87581	so that You may teach them the good way
c87582	in which they should walk.
c87583	May You send rain on the land
c87584	that You gave Your people as an inheritance.
c87585	famine
c87586	When ... comes upon the land,
c87587	pestilence
c87588	[or]
c87589	blight [or] mildew [or] locusts [or] grasshoppers,
c87590	[or]
c87591	when their enemies besiege them in their cities,
c87592	whatever plague [or] sickness [there is],
c87593	may whatever prayer or petition
c87594	Your people Israel make—
c87595	knowing
c87596	each ... his own afflictions
c87597	and spreading out his hands toward this house—
c87598	be heard by You from heaven, Your dwelling place.
c87599	And may You forgive
c87600	and repay each man according to all his ways,
c87601	since You know his heart—
c87602	for You alone know the hearts of men—
c87603	so that they may fear You
c87604	and walk in Your ways all the days
c87605	they live in the land
c87606	You gave to our fathers.
c87607	And as for the foreigner
c87608	who is not of Your people Israel
c87609	but has come from a distant land because of Your great name and Your mighty hand and outstretched arm—
c87610	when he comes
c87611	and prays toward this house,
c87612	may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place,
c87613	and do according to all
c87614	for which the foreigner calls to You.
c87615	Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name
c87616	and fear You, as [do] Your people Israel,
c87617	and they will know
c87618	that this house ... is called by Your Name.
c87619	I have built
c87620	When Your people go to war against their enemies, wherever
c87621	You send them,
c87622	and when they pray to You in the direction of the city
c87623	You have chosen
c87624	and the house
c87625	I have built for Your Name,
c87626	may You hear from heaven their prayer and their plea,
c87627	and may You uphold their cause.
c87628	When they sin against You—
c87629	for there is no one
c87630	who does not sin—
c87631	and You become angry with them
c87632	and deliver them to an enemy
c87633	who takes them as captives to a land far or near,
c87634	and when they come to their senses in the land
c87635	to which they were taken,
c87636	and they repent
c87637	and plead with You in the land of their captors,
c87638	saying,
c87639	‘We have sinned
c87640	and done wrong;
c87641	we have acted wickedly,’
c87642	and when they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of the enemies
c87643	who took them captive,
c87644	and when they pray in the direction of the land
c87645	that You gave to their fathers,
c87646	the city
c87647	You have chosen,
c87648	and the house
c87649	I have built for Your Name,
c87650	may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and petition,
c87651	and may You uphold their cause.
c87652	May You forgive Your people
c87653	who sinned against You.
c87654	Now,
c87655	my God,
c87656	may Your eyes be open
c87657	and Your ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place.
c87658	Now therefore,
c87659	arise,
c87660	O LORD God,
c87661	and enter Your resting place,
c87662	You and the ark of Your might.
c87663	May Your priests,
c87664	O LORD God,
c87665	be clothed with salvation,
c87666	and may Your godly ones rejoice in goodness.
c87667	O LORD God,
c87668	do not reject Your anointed one.
c87669	Remember [Your] loving devotion to Your servant David.”
c87670	When Solomon had finished
c87671	praying,
c87672	fire came down from heaven
c87673	and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices,
c87674	and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
c87675	The priests were not able
c87676	to enter the house of the LORD,
c87677	because the glory of the LORD had filled [it].
c87678	When all the Israelites saw
c87679	the fire coming down and the glory of the LORD above the temple,
c87680	they bowed down
c87681	with their faces to the ground,
c87682	on the pavement
c87683	and they worshiped
c87684	and gave thanks to the LORD:
c87685	“For He is good;
c87686	His loving devotion endures forever.”
c87687	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
c87688	And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep.
c87689	So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
c87690	The priests stood at their posts,
c87691	as did the Levites with the musical instruments of the LORD,
c87692	which King David had made
c87693	for giving thanks to the LORD
c87694	“For His loving devotion endures forever.”
c87695	and with which David had offered praise, saying,
c87696	Across from the Levites, the priests sounded trumpets,
c87697	and all the Israelites were standing.
c87698	Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard
c87699	in front of the house of the LORD,
c87700	there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, since
c87701	and ... the bronze altar
c87702	[he] had made
c87703	could not
c87704	contain [all these offerings].
c87705	So at that time Solomon ... observed the feast for seven days.
c87706	and all Israel with him— a very great assembly of people
c87707	from Lebo-hamath
c87708	to the Brook of Egypt—
c87709	On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly,
c87710	for the dedication of the altar had lasted seven days,
c87711	and the feast seven days more.
c87712	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, [Solomon] sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the good things
c87713	that the LORD had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel.
c87714	When Solomon had finished the house of the LORD and the royal palace,
c87715	all
c87716	carrying out ... that was in [his] heart
c87717	to do for the house of the LORD and for his own palace,
c87718	successfully
c87719	the LORD appeared to [him] at night
c87720	and said to him:
c87721	“I have heard your prayer
c87722	and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice.
c87723	If I close the sky
c87724	so there is no rain,
c87725	or if I command the locust
c87726	to devour the land,
c87727	or if I send a plague among My people,
c87728	and My people ... humble themselves
c87729	who are called by My name
c87730	and pray
c87731	and seek My face,
c87732	and turn from their wicked ways,
c87733	then I will hear from heaven,
c87734	forgive their sin,
c87735	and heal their land.
c87736	Now My eyes will be open
c87737	and My ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
c87739	For I have now chosen
c87740	and consecrated this house
c87741	so that My Name may be there forever.
c87742	My eyes and My heart will be there for all time.
c87743	And as for you,
c87744	if you walk before
c87745	Me as your father David walked,
c87746	doing all
c87747	I have commanded you,
c87748	and if you keep My statutes and ordinances,
c87749	then I will establish your royal throne,
c87750	as I covenanted with your father David
c87751	when I said,
c87752	‘You will never fail to have a man
c87753	to rule over Israel.’
c87754	But if you turn away
c87755	and forsake the statutes and the commandments
c87756	I have set before you,
c87757	and if you go off
c87758	to serve ... other gods,
c87759	and worship
c87760	then I will uproot Israel from the soil
c87761	I have given them,
c87762	and this temple
c87763	that I have sanctified for My Name
c87764	I will banish from My presence.
c87765	I will make it an object of scorn and ridicule among all the peoples.
c87766	And this temple
c87767	will now become a heap of rubble. All
c87768	who pass it by
c87769	will be appalled
c87770	and say,
c87771	‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’
c87772	And [others] will answer,
c87773	‘Because they have forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers,
c87774	who brought them out of Egypt,
c87775	and have embraced other gods,
c87776	worshiping
c87777	and serving them.
c87778	Because of this, He has brought all this disaster upon them.’”
c87779	Now at the end of the twenty years
c87780	during which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own palace,
c87781	the cities
c87782	Solomon ... Hiram had given
c87783	rebuilt ... him
c87784	and settled Israelites there.
c87785	Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah
c87786	and captured it.
c87787	He built Tadmor in the wilderness,
c87788	along with all the store cities
c87789	that he had built in Hamath.
c87790	He rebuilt Upper and Lower Beth-horon as fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,
c87791	as well as Baalath, all the store cities
c87792	that belonged to Solomon,
c87793	all the cities [for his] chariots and horses, and everything [he]
c87794	desired
c87795	to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion.
c87796	As for all the people
c87797	who remained of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites
c87798	(the people who were not Israelites)—
c87799	their descendants
c87800	who remained in the land,
c87801	those whom the Israelites were unable to destroy completely—
c87802	Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day.
c87803	any of the Israelites
c87804	But Solomon did not consign ... to slave labor,
c87805	because they [were] his men of war, his officers and captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry.
c87806	[They] [were also] the chief officers
c87807	for King Solomon:
c87808	250
c87809	supervisors.
c87810	Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the palace
c87811	he had built for her.
c87812	For he said,
c87813	“My wife must not live in the house of David king of Israel,
c87814	because the places ... are holy.”
c87815	the ark of the LORD has entered
c87816	At that time Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD
c87817	he had built in front of the portico.
c87818	He observed the daily requirement
c87819	for offerings according to the commandment of Moses
c87820	for Sabbaths, New Moons, and the three annual appointed feasts— the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles.
c87821	In keeping with the ordinances of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests over their service,
c87822	and the Levites for their duties
c87823	to offer praise
c87824	and to minister before the priests according to the daily requirement.
c87825	[He also appointed] gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate,
c87826	for this had been the command of David, the man of God.
c87827	They did not turn aside from the king’s command regarding the priests or the Levites or any matter concerning the treasuries.
c87828	Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out, from the day the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD
c87829	until it was finished.
c87830	So the house of the LORD was completed.
c87831	Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the coast of Edom.
c87832	So Hiram sent him ships by his servants, along with crews
c87833	of experienced sailors.
c87834	They went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir
c87835	and acquired from there 450 talents of gold,
c87836	which they delivered to King Solomon.
c87837	Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon,
c87838	she came
c87839	to test [him] with difficult questions.
c87840	[She arrived] in Jerusalem with a very large caravan, with camels
c87841	bearing spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones.
c87842	So she came to Solomon
c87843	and spoke to him all
c87844	that was on her mind.
c87845	And Solomon answered all her questions;
c87846	nothing was too difficult for [him]
c87847	to explain.
c87848	When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, the palace
c87849	he had built,
c87850	the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and cupbearers, and the burnt offerings
c87851	he presented at the house of the LORD,
c87852	it took her breath away.
c87853	She said to the king,
c87854	“The report ... is true.
c87855	I heard in my own country about your words [and] wisdom
c87856	But I did not believe the reports
c87857	until I came
c87858	and saw with my own eyes.
c87859	Indeed,
c87860	not half of the greatness of your wisdom was told to me.
c87861	You have far exceeded the report
c87862	I heard.
c87863	How blessed are your men!
c87864	How blessed are these servants of yours
c87865	who stand continually before you
c87866	and hear your wisdom.
c87867	Blessed be the LORD your God,
c87868	who has delighted in you
c87869	to set you on His throne [to be] king for the LORD your God.
c87870	Because your God loved Israel
c87871	enough to establish them forever,
c87872	He has made you king over them
c87873	to carry out justice and righteousness.”
c87874	Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones.
c87875	There had never been such spices
c87876	as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
c87877	(The servants of Hiram [and] of Solomon, ... also
c87878	who brought gold from Ophir,
c87879	brought algum wood and precious stones.
c87880	The king made the algum wood into steps for the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace,
c87881	and into lyres and harps for the singers.
c87882	Never before had anything like them been seen in the land of Judah.)
c87883	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired—
c87884	whatever she asked—
c87885	far more than she had brought the king.
c87886	left
c87887	Then she ... and returned to her own country, along with her servants.
c87888	was
c87889	The weight of gold
c87890	that came to Solomon each year
c87891	666 talents,
c87892	not including the revenue from the merchants and traders.
c87893	And all the Arabian kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
c87894	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold;
c87895	six hundred [shekels] of hammered gold went into each shield.
c87896	[He also made] three hundred small shields of hammered gold;
c87897	three hundred [shekels] of gold went into each shield.
c87898	And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
c87899	Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory
c87900	and overlaid it with pure gold.
c87901	The throne had six steps,
c87902	and a footstool of gold was attached to it.
c87903	There were armrests on both sides of the seat,
c87904	with a lion standing beside each armrest.
c87905	Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each [step].
c87906	Nothing like [this] had ever been made for any kingdom.
c87907	All of King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold,
c87908	and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold.
c87909	There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.
c87910	For the king had the ships of Tarshish that went with Hiram’ s servants,
c87911	and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive
c87912	bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
c87913	So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
c87914	All the kings of the earth sought an audience with Solomon
c87915	to hear the wisdom
c87916	that God had put in his heart.
c87917	would bring
c87918	[each] visitor ... his tribute:
c87919	Year after year, ... articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
c87920	Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horses,
c87921	which he stationed in the chariot cities
c87922	and also with [him] in Jerusalem.
c87923	He reigned over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.
c87924	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones,
c87925	and cedar ... as sycamore
c87926	as abundant ... in the foothills.
c87927	Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt
c87928	and from all the lands.
c87929	As for the rest of the acts of Solomon, from beginning to end,
c87930	[are] they not written in the Records of Nathan the Prophet, in the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the Visions of Iddo the Seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?
c87931	Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
c87932	And Solomon rested with his fathers
c87933	and was buried in the city of his father David.
c87934	And his son Rehoboam became king in his place.
c87935	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem,
c87936	for all Israel had gone [there]
c87937	to make him king.
c87939	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about this,
c87941	where he had fled from King Solomon.
c87942	[he] returned from Egypt,
c87943	So they sent for
c87944	[Jeroboam],
c87945	and [he] and all Israel came
c87946	to Rehoboam and said,
c87948	“Your father put a heavy yoke on us.
c87949	But now
c87950	you should lighten the burden of your father’s service and the heavy yoke
c87951	he put on us,
c87952	and we will serve you.”
c87953	Rehoboam answered,
c87954	in three days.”
c87955	“Come back to me
c87956	So the people departed.
c87957	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders
c87958	who had served his father Solomon during
c87959	his lifetime.
c87960	he asked.
c87961	“How do you advise
c87962	me to respond to these people?”
c87963	They replied, ... to them,
c87965	“If you will be kind to these people
c87966	and please them
c87967	by speaking kind words
c87968	they will be your servants forever.”
c87969	But [Rehoboam] rejected the advice of the elders;
c87971	instead, he consulted the young men ... with him
c87972	who had grown up
c87973	and served him.
c87974	He asked them,
c87975	“What ... do you advise
c87976	message ... that we send back to these people
c87977	who have spoken to me,
c87978	saying,
c87979	‘Lighten the yoke
c87980	your father put on us’?”
c87981	The young men ... with him replied,
c87982	who had grown up
c87983	you should answer
c87984	“This is how ... these people
c87985	who said to you,
c87987	‘Your father made our yoke heavy,
c87988	but you should make it lighter.’
c87989	This is what you should tell them:
c87990	‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist!
c87991	Although
c87992	my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, ... to
c87993	I will add ... your yoke.
c87994	Although my father scourged you with whips,
c87995	I [will scourge you] with scorpions.’”
c87996	After three days, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam,
c87997	since the king
c87998	had said,
c87999	“Come back to me on the third day.”
c88000	And the king answered them harshly.
c88001	King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders
c88002	and spoke to them as the young men had advised,
c88003	saying,
c88004	“Although my father made your yoke heavy,
c88005	I will add to it.
c88006	Although my father scourged you with whips,
c88007	I [will scourge you] with scorpions!”
c88008	So the king did not listen to the people,
c88009	and indeed this turn of events was from God,
c88010	in order that the LORD might fulfill the word
c88011	that He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
c88012	When all Israel [saw]
c88013	that the king had refused to listen
c88014	to them, they answered the king:
c88016	“What portion do we have in David,
c88017	and what inheritance in the son of Jesse?
c88018	To your tents,
c88019	O Israel!
c88020	Look now to your own house,
c88021	O David!”
c88022	So all the Israelites went home,
c88023	the Israelites
c88024	living in the cities of Judah.
c88025	but Rehoboam still reigned over
c88026	Then King Rehoboam sent out Hadoram,
c88027	who was in charge of the labor force,
c88028	but the Israelites stoned
c88029	him to death.
c88030	And King Rehoboam ... in haste
c88031	mounted his chariot
c88032	and escaped to Jerusalem.
c88033	So to this day Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David.
c88034	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem,
c88035	he mobilized the house of Judah and Benjamin—
c88036	180,000 choice
c88037	warriors—
c88038	to fight against Israel
c88039	and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
c88040	But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God:
c88042	“Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin
c88044	that this is what the LORD says:
c88045	‘You are not to go up
c88046	and fight against your brothers.
c88047	of you must return
c88048	Each ... home,
c88049	for this word is from Me.’”
c88050	So they listened to the words of the LORD
c88051	and turned back
c88052	from going against Jeroboam.
c88053	Rehoboam continued to live in Jerusalem,
c88054	and he built up cities for defense in Judah.
c88055	He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
c88056	Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,
c88057	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
c88058	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
c88059	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron,
c88060	in Judah and Benjamin.
c88061	the fortified cities
c88062	He strengthened their fortresses
c88063	and put officers in them, with supplies of food, oil, and wine.
c88064	He also put shields and spears in all the cities
c88065	and strengthened
c88066	them greatly.
c88067	So Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.
c88068	Moreover, the priests and Levites
c88069	from all ... Israel
c88070	their districts throughout ... stood with Rehoboam.
c88071	For the Levites left their pasturelands and their possessions
c88072	and went to Judah and Jerusalem,
c88073	because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them
c88074	as priests of the LORD.
c88075	And Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat-demons and calf idols
c88076	he had made.
c88077	Those from every tribe of Israel ... followed [the Levites]
c88078	who had set their hearts
c88079	to seek the LORD their God
c88080	to Jerusalem
c88081	to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
c88082	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah
c88083	and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years,
c88084	because they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.
c88085	And Rehoboam married Mahalath, [who was] the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab.
c88086	She bore sons to him: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
c88087	After her, he married Maacah daughter of Absalom,
c88088	and she bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
c88089	Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines.
c88090	In all, he had eighteen wives
c88091	and sixty concubines,
c88092	and he was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
c88093	Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers,
c88094	intending to make him king.
c88095	Rehoboam also acted wisely
c88096	by dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities.
c88097	He gave them abundant provisions
c88098	and sought many wives for them.
c88100	After Rehoboam had established his sovereignty
c88101	and royal power,
c88102	forsook the law of the LORD.
c88103	he and all Israel with him
c88104	In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign,
c88105	Shishak king of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem
c88106	because they had been unfaithful to the LORD,
c88107	with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen,
c88108	and countless troops
c88109	who came with him out of Egypt—
c88110	Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites.
c88111	He captured the fortified cities
c88112	of Judah
c88113	and came as far as Jerusalem.
c88114	Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah
c88115	who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak,
c88116	and he said to them,
c88117	“This is what the LORD says:
c88118	‘You have forsaken Me;
c88119	therefore, I have forsaken you into the hand of Shishak.’”
c88120	So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves
c88121	and said,
c88122	“The LORD [is] righteous.”
c88124	When the LORD saw
c88125	that they had humbled themselves,
c88126	the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah,
c88127	saying,
c88128	“They have humbled themselves;
c88129	I will not destroy them,
c88130	but will soon grant them deliverance.
c88131	My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak.
c88132	Nevertheless, they will become his servants,
c88133	so that they may learn the difference between serving Me and serving the kings of other lands.”
c88134	So King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem
c88135	and seized the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the royal palace.
c88136	He took everything,
c88137	[including] the gold shields
c88138	that Solomon had made.
c88139	Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place
c88140	and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard
c88141	on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
c88143	Whenever the king would enter the house of the LORD,
c88144	the guards would go [with him],
c88145	bearing [the shields],
c88146	and [later] take them back to the guardroom.
c88148	Because Rehoboam humbled himself,
c88149	the anger of the LORD turned away from him,
c88150	and He did not
c88151	destroy him completely.
c88152	Moreover, conditions were good in Judah.
c88153	Thus King Rehoboam established himself in Jerusalem.
c88154	when he became king,
c88155	[He was] forty-one years old
c88156	and he reigned
c88157	seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
c88158	the LORD had chosen
c88159	in which to put His Name.
c88160	from all the tribes of Israel
c88161	His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
c88162	And Rehoboam did evil
c88163	because he did not set his heart
c88164	to seek the LORD.
c88165	Now the acts of Rehoboam from first to last,
c88166	[are] they not written in the records of Shemaiah the Prophet and of Iddo the Seer
c88167	concerning the genealogies?
c88168	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their days.
c88169	And Rehoboam rested with his fathers
c88170	and was buried in the City of David.
c88171	And his son Abijah became king in his place.
c88172	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam,
c88173	Abijah became king of Judah,
c88174	and he reigned in Jerusalem three years.
c88175	His mother’s name was Micaiah daughter of Uriel; she was from Gibeah.
c88176	And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
c88177	Abijah went into battle with an army of 400,000 choice men,
c88178	while Jeroboam drew up in formation against him with his army of 800,000 choice men.
c88179	Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim,
c88180	which is in the hill country of Ephraim,
c88181	and said,
c88182	“Hear me,
c88183	O Jeroboam and all Israel!
c88184	Do you not
c88185	know
c88186	that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David ... forever
c88187	and his descendants ... by a covenant of salt?
c88188	Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up
c88189	and rebelled against his master.
c88190	Then worthless and wicked men gathered around him
c88191	to resist Rehoboam son of Solomon
c88192	when [he] was young, inexperienced,
c88193	and unable to resist them.
c88194	And now
c88195	you think
c88196	you can resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David’s descendants.
c88197	You are indeed a vast army,
c88198	and you have with you the golden calves
c88199	that Jeroboam made for you as gods.
c88200	But did you not drive out the priests of the LORD, the descendants of Aaron, and the Levites,
c88201	and make priests for yourselves as do the peoples of other lands?
c88202	Now whoever
c88203	comes
c88204	to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams
c88205	can become a priest of [things that are] not gods.
c88206	But as for us,
c88207	the LORD is our God.
c88208	We have not forsaken Him;
c88209	the priests
c88210	ministering to the LORD
c88211	are descendants of Aaron,
c88212	and the Levites [attend] to [their] duties.
c88213	Every morning and every evening they present burnt offerings ... to the LORD.
c88214	and fragrant incense ... They set out the rows of showbread on the ceremonially clean table,
c88215	the lamps of the gold lampstand.
c88216	and every evening they light
c88217	We are carrying out the requirements of the LORD our God,
c88218	while you have forsaken Him.
c88219	Now behold,
c88220	God Himself is with us as [our] head,
c88221	and His priests with their trumpets ... the battle call
c88222	sound ... against you.
c88223	O children of Israel,
c88224	do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers,
c88225	for you will not succeed.”
c88226	Now Jeroboam had sent an ambush around
c88227	to advance from the rear,
c88228	so that while he was in front of Judah,
c88229	the ambush was behind them.
c88230	When Judah turned
c88231	and discovered
c88232	that the battle [was] before and behind them,
c88233	they cried out to the LORD.
c88234	Then the priests blew the trumpets,
c88235	and the men of Judah raised the battle cry.
c88237	And when [they] raised the cry,
c88238	God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
c88239	So the Israelites fled before Judah,
c88240	and God delivered them into their hands.
c88241	Then Abijah and his people struck them with a mighty blow,
c88242	and 500,000 choice men of Israel fell slain.
c88243	Thus the Israelites were subdued at that time,
c88244	and the men of Judah prevailed
c88245	because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers.
c88246	Abijah pursued Jeroboam
c88247	and captured some cities from him: Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, along with their villages.
c88248	Jeroboam did not again recover his power during the days of Abijah,
c88249	and the LORD struck him down
c88250	and he died.
c88251	But Abijah grew strong,
c88252	married fourteen wives,
c88253	and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
c88254	As for the rest of the acts of Abijah, along with his ways and his sayings, they are written in the Treatise of the Prophet Iddo.
c88255	Then Abijah rested with his fathers
c88256	and was buried in the City of David.
c88257	And his son Asa became king in his place.
c88258	During his reign the land was at peace [for] ten years.
c88259	And Asa did
c88260	what was good
c88261	and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
c88262	He removed the foreign altars and high places,
c88263	shattered their sacred pillars,
c88264	and chopped down the Asherah poles.
c88265	He commanded the people of Judah
c88266	to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers,
c88267	and to observe the law and the commandments.
c88268	He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah,
c88269	and under him the kingdom was at peace.
c88270	Asa built fortified cities in Judah.
c88271	Because the land was at peace,
c88272	In those days no one made war with him,
c88273	because the LORD gave him rest.
c88274	So he said to the people of Judah,
c88275	“Let us build these cities
c88276	and surround them with walls and towers, with doors and bars.
c88277	is still
c88278	The land ... ours
c88279	because we have sought the LORD our God.
c88280	We have sought [Him]
c88281	and He has given us rest on every side.”
c88282	So they built
c88283	and prospered.
c88284	Asa had an army
c88285	bearing large shields and spears,
c88286	of 300,000 men from Judah
c88287	and 280,000 men from Benjamin bearing small shields and drawing the bow.
c88288	All these [were] mighty warriors.
c88289	Then Zerah the Cushite came against them with an army of 1,000,000 men [and] 300 chariots,
c88290	and they advanced as far as Mareshah.
c88291	So Asa marched out against
c88292	him and lined up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
c88293	Then Asa cried out to the LORD his God:
c88295	“O LORD,
c88296	there is no one besides You
c88297	to help the powerless against the mighty.
c88298	Help us,
c88299	O LORD our God,
c88300	for we rely on You,
c88301	and in Your name we have come against this multitude.
c88302	O LORD,
c88303	You are our God.
c88304	Do not let a mere mortal prevail against You.”
c88305	So the LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah,
c88306	and the Cushites fled.
c88307	Then Asa and his army pursued them
c88309	as far as Gerar.
c88310	The Cushites fell
c88311	and could not recover,
c88312	for they were crushed before the LORD and His army.
c88313	So the people of Judah carried off a great amount of plunder
c88314	and attacked all the cities around Gerar,
c88315	because the terror of the LORD had fallen upon them.
c88316	They plundered all the cities,
c88317	since there was much plunder there.
c88318	They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen
c88319	and carried off many sheep and camels.
c88320	Then they returned to Jerusalem.
c88321	Azariah son of Oded.
c88322	Now the Spirit of God came upon
c88323	So he went out to meet Asa
c88324	and said to him,
c88325	“Listen to me,
c88326	Asa and all Judah and Benjamin.
c88327	The LORD is with you
c88328	when you are with Him.
c88329	If you seek Him,
c88330	He will be found by you,
c88331	but if you forsake Him,
c88332	He will forsake you.
c88333	For many years Israel has been without the true God, without a priest to instruct them, and without law.
c88334	they turned
c88335	But in their distress
c88336	to the LORD, the God of Israel,
c88337	and sought Him,
c88338	and He was found by them.
c88339	In those days there was no safety for travelers,
c88340	because the residents of the lands had many conflicts.
c88341	was crushed
c88342	Nation ... by nation,
c88343	and city by city,
c88344	for God afflicted them with all kinds of adversity.
c88345	But as for you, be strong;
c88346	do not be discouraged,
c88347	for your work will be rewarded.”
c88349	When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet,
c88350	he took courage
c88351	and removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities
c88352	he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. ... that
c88353	He then restored the altar of the LORD
c88354	was in front of the portico of the LORD’s temple.
c88355	And he assembled all Judah and Benjamin, along with those from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had settled among them,
c88356	for great numbers had come over to him from Israel
c88357	when they saw
c88358	that the LORD his God was with him.
c88359	So they gathered together in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign.
c88360	At that time they sacrificed to the LORD ... from all the plunder
c88361	they had brought back.
c88362	seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep
c88363	Then they entered into a covenant
c88364	to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul.
c88365	And
c88366	whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel,
c88367	would be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman.
c88368	They took an oath to the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting, trumpets, and horns.
c88369	And all Judah rejoiced over the oath,
c88370	for they had sworn it with all their heart.
c88371	They had sought Him earnestly,
c88372	and He was found by them.
c88373	So the LORD gave them rest on every side.
c88374	King Asa also ... his grandmother Maacah
c88375	removed ... as the queen mother,
c88376	because she had made a detestable Asherah pole.
c88377	Asa chopped down the pole,
c88378	crushed it,
c88379	and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
c88380	The high places were not removed from Israel,
c88381	but Asa's heart was fully devoted all his days.
c88382	And he brought into the house of God the silver and gold articles that he and his father had dedicated.
c88383	And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
c88384	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's [reign], Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah
c88385	and fortified Ramah
c88386	to prevent [anyone] from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
c88387	So Asa withdrew the silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the royal palace
c88388	and sent it to Ben-hadad king of Aram,
c88389	who lived in Damascus,
c88390	with this message:
c88391	“[Let there be] a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father.
c88392	See, I have sent you silver and gold.
c88393	Now go
c88394	and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel,
c88395	so that he will withdraw from me.”
c88396	And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa
c88397	and sent the commanders of his armies
c88399	against the cities of Israel,
c88400	conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
c88402	When Baasha learned of this,
c88403	he stopped
c88404	fortifying Ramah
c88405	and abandoned his work.
c88406	Then King Asa brought all [the men] of Judah,
c88407	and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers
c88408	Baasha had used for building.
c88409	And with [these materials] he built up Geba and Mizpah.
c88410	At that time, Hanani the seer came to King Asa of Judah
c88411	and told him,
c88412	“Because you have relied on the king of Aram
c88413	and not on the LORD your God,
c88414	the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.
c88415	Were not the Cushites and Libyans a vast army ... chariots and horsemen?
c88416	with many
c88418	Yet because you relied on the LORD,
c88419	He delivered them into your hand.
c88420	For ... of the LORD
c88421	the eyes ... roam throughout the earth
c88422	to show Himself strong on behalf of [those] whose heart
c88423	is fully devoted to Him.
c88424	You have acted foolishly in this matter.
c88425	From now on, therefore, you will be at war.”
c88426	Asa was angry with the seer
c88427	and put him in prison
c88428	because [he was] so enraged over this matter.
c88429	And at the same time Asa oppressed some of the people.
c88430	Now the rest of the acts of Asa, from beginning to end,
c88431	they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
c88432	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet,
c88433	and it became increasingly severe.
c88434	Yet even in his illness he did not seek the LORD,
c88435	but only the physicians.
c88436	Asa ... and rested with his fathers.
c88437	So in the forty-first year ... died
c88438	of his reign,
c88439	And he was buried in the tomb
c88440	that he had cut out for himself in the City of David.
c88441	They laid him on a bier
c88442	that was full of spices and various
c88443	blended perfumes;
c88444	then they made a great fire in his honor.
c88445	Asa's son Jehoshaphat became king in his place,
c88446	and he strengthened himself against Israel.
c88447	He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah
c88448	and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim
c88449	that his father Asa had captured.
c88450	Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat
c88451	because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David.
c88452	He did not seek out the Baals,
c88453	but he sought the God of his father
c88454	and walked by His commandments
c88455	rather than the practices of Israel.
c88456	So the LORD established the kingdom in his hand,
c88457	and all Judah brought him tribute,
c88458	so that he had an abundance of riches and honor.
c88459	And his heart took delight in the ways of the LORD;
c88460	furthermore, he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.
c88461	In the third year
c88462	of his reign,
c88463	Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah
c88464	to teach in the cities of Judah,
c88465	accompanied by certain Levites— Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah—
c88466	along with the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
c88467	They taught throughout Judah,
c88468	taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD.
c88469	They went throughout the towns of Judah
c88470	and taught the people.
c88471	And the dread of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
c88472	that surrounded Judah,
c88473	so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.
c88474	Some Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat,
c88475	and the Arabs brought him flocks of7,700 rams and 7,700 goats.
c88476	Jehoshaphat grew stronger
c88477	and stronger,
c88478	and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah
c88479	and kept a large amount of supplies in the cities of Judah. He also had
c88480	fighting men, mighty warriors, in Jerusalem.
c88481	These are their numbers according to the houses of their fathers:
c88482	For Judah, the commanders of thousands:
c88483	Adnah the commander
c88484	and 300,000 mighty warriors with him;
c88485	next to him, Jehohanan the commander
c88486	and 280,000 with him;
c88487	next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri,
c88488	the volunteer for the LORD,
c88489	and 200,000 mighty warriors with him;
c88490	from Benjamin, Eliada, a mighty warrior,
c88491	and 200,000 with him armed with bows and shields;
c88492	and next to him, Jehozabad
c88493	and 180,000 with him equipped for war.
c88494	These were the men
c88495	who served the king,
c88496	besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
c88497	Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance,
c88498	and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.
c88499	And some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria,
c88500	where Ahab sacrificed many sheep and cattle for him
c88501	and the people
c88502	with him,
c88503	and urged him
c88504	to march up to Ramoth-gilead.
c88505	Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
c88506	“Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?”
c88507	And Jehoshaphat replied,
c88508	“I [am] as you [are],
c88509	and my people as your people;
c88510	[we will join] you in the war.”
c88511	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel,
c88512	“Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.”
c88513	So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men,
c88514	and asked them,
c88515	“Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead,
c88516	or should we refrain?”
c88517	they replied,
c88518	“Go up,”
c88519	“and God will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
c88520	But Jehoshaphat asked,
c88521	“Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here
c88522	of whom we can inquire?”
c88523	The king of Israel answered,
c88524	“There is still one man
c88525	who can ask the LORD,
c88526	but I hate him
c88527	because he never prophesies anything good for me,
c88528	but only bad.
c88529	He is Micaiah son of Imlah.”
c88530	say ... Jehoshaphat
c88531	“The king should not ... that!” ... replied.
c88532	So the king of Israel called one of his officials
c88533	and said,
c88534	“Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah {at once}.”
c88535	the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting
c88536	on their thrones
c88537	Dressed in royal attire,
c88538	at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria,
c88539	with all the prophets prophesying before them.
c88540	Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for himself iron horns
c88541	and declared,
c88542	“This is what the LORD says:
c88543	‘With these you shall gore the Arameans
c88544	until they are finished off.’”
c88545	And all the prophets were prophesying the same,
c88546	saying,
c88547	“Go up to Ramoth-gilead
c88548	and prosper,
c88549	for the LORD will deliver [it] into the hand of the king.”
c88550	Then the messenger
c88551	who had gone
c88552	to call Micaiah
c88553	instructed him, ... to
c88555	“Behold, with one accord the words of the prophets are favorable ... the king.
c88556	So please let your words be like theirs,
c88557	and speak favorably.”
c88558	But Micaiah said,
c88559	“As surely as the LORD lives,
c88561	whatever my God tells me.”
c88562	I will speak
c88563	When Micaiah arrived,
c88564	the king asked him,
c88565	“Micaiah,
c88566	should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead,
c88567	or should we refrain?”
c88568	Micaiah replied,
c88569	“Go up
c88570	and triumph,”
c88571	“for they will be given into your hand.”
c88572	But the king said to him,
c88573	“How many times must I make you swear
c88574	not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
c88575	So Micaiah declared:
c88576	“I saw all Israel
c88577	scattered on the hills like sheep
c88578	without a shepherd.
c88579	And the LORD said,
c88580	‘These [people] have no master;
c88581	return
c88582	let each one ... home
c88583	in peace.’”
c88584	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
c88585	“Did I not tell you
c88586	that he never prophesies good for me,
c88587	but only bad?”
c88588	Micaiah continued,
c88589	“Therefore hear the word of the LORD:
c88590	I saw the LORD
c88591	sitting on His throne,
c88592	and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left.
c88593	And the LORD said,
c88594	‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel
c88595	to march up
c88596	and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’
c88597	suggested
c88598	And one ... this,
c88599	and another that.
c88600	Then a spirit came forward,
c88601	stood before the LORD,
c88602	and said,
c88603	‘I will entice him.’
c88604	asked the LORD.
c88605	‘By what means?’
c88606	And he replied,
c88607	‘I will go out
c88608	and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’
c88609	said [the LORD].
c88610	‘You will surely
c88611	entice him and prevail,’
c88612	‘Go
c88613	and do it.’
c88614	So
c88615	you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours,
c88616	and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you.”
c88617	Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up,
c88618	struck Micaiah in the face,
c88619	and demanded,
c88620	“Which way
c88621	did the Spirit of the LORD [go] when He departed from me
c88622	to speak to you?”
c88623	Micaiah replied,
c88624	“You will soon see, on that day
c88625	when you go ... in an inner room.”
c88626	[and] hide
c88627	And the king of Israel declared,
c88628	“Take Micaiah
c88629	and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son,
c88630	and tell them
c88631	that this is what the king says:
c88632	‘Put this [man] in prison
c88633	and feed him only bread and water
c88634	until I return safely.’”
c88635	But Micaiah replied,
c88636	“If you ever return safely,
c88637	the LORD has not spoken through me.”
c88638	Then he added,
c88639	“Take heed,
c88640	all you people!”
c88641	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
c88642	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
c88643	“I will disguise
c88644	myself and go into battle,
c88645	but you wear your royal robes.”
c88646	So the king of Israel disguised himself
c88647	and went into battle.
c88648	Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders,
c88651	“Do not fight with anyone, small or great,
c88652	except the king of Israel.”
c88654	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat,
c88655	they said,
c88656	“This is the king of Israel!”
c88657	So they turned to fight
c88658	against him,
c88659	but Jehoshaphat cried out,
c88660	and the LORD helped him.
c88661	God drew them away from him.
c88662	he was
c88663	And when the chariot commanders saw
c88664	that ... not the king of Israel,
c88665	they turned back from pursuing him.
c88666	However, a [certain] man drew his bow without taking special aim,
c88667	and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor.
c88668	So [the king] said to his charioteer,
c88669	“Turn around
c88670	and take me out of the battle,
c88671	for I am badly wounded!”
c88672	The battle raged throughout that day,
c88673	and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening.
c88674	he died.
c88675	And at sunset
c88676	Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his home in Jerusalem.
c88677	Then Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to confront
c88678	him and said to King Jehoshaphat,
c88679	the wicked
c88680	“Do you help
c88682	those who hate the LORD?
c88683	and love
c88684	Because of this, the wrath of the LORD [is] upon you.
c88685	However, some good is found in you,
c88686	for you have removed the Asherah poles from the land
c88687	and have set your heart
c88688	to seek God.”
c88689	Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem,
c88690	and once again
c88691	he went out among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim
c88692	and turned them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
c88693	He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah.
c88694	Then he said to the judges,
c88695	“Consider carefully
c88696	what you do,
c88697	for you are not judging for man,
c88698	but for the LORD,
c88699	who is with you when you render judgment.
c88700	And now,
c88701	may the fear of the LORD be upon you.
c88702	Be careful
c88703	what you do,
c88704	for with the LORD our God there is no injustice, partiality, or bribery.”
c88705	In Jerusalem Jehoshaphat also appointed some of the Levites, priests, and heads of the Israelite families to judge on behalf of the LORD and to settle disputes.
c88706	And they lived in Jerusalem.
c88707	He commanded them,
c88708	saying,
c88709	“You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD.
c88710	For every dispute
c88711	that comes before you from your brothers
c88712	who dwell in their cities—
c88713	whether of bloodshed or offenses against the law, commandment, statutes, or judgments—
c88714	you are to warn them,
c88715	so that they will not incur guilt before the LORD
c88716	and wrath will not come upon you and your brothers.
c88717	Do this,
c88718	and you will not incur guilt.
c88719	Note that
c88720	Amariah, the chief priest, will be over you in all that pertains to the LORD,
c88721	and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all that pertains to the king.
c88722	And the Levites [will serve as] officers before you.
c88723	resolutely;
c88724	Act
c88725	may the LORD be with the upright.”
c88726	After this,
c88727	the Moabites and Ammonites, ... came
c88728	together with some of the Meunites,
c88729	to make war against Jehoshaphat.
c88730	Then some men came
c88731	and told Jehoshaphat,
c88733	“A vast army is coming against you from Edom, from beyond the Sea;
c88734	they are already in Hazazon-tamar”
c88735	(that is, En-gedi).
c88736	was alarmed
c88737	Jehoshaphat ... and set his face
c88738	to seek the LORD.
c88739	And he proclaimed a fast throughout Judah.
c88740	So [the people of] Judah gathered
c88741	to seek the LORD,
c88742	and indeed, they came from all the cities of Judah
c88743	to seek Him.
c88744	Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the LORD, in front of the new courtyard
c88745	and said,
c88746	“O LORD, God of our fathers,
c88747	are You not the God who is in heaven,
c88748	and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations?
c88749	Power and might are in Your hand,
c88750	and no ... against You.
c88751	one can stand
c88752	did You not
c88753	O our God,
c88754	drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel
c88755	and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham Your friend?
c88756	They have lived in the land
c88757	and have built in it a sanctuary for Your Name,
c88758	saying,
c88759	‘If disaster comes upon us— whether sword or judgment, plague or famine—
c88760	we will stand before this temple and before You,
c88761	for Your Name is in this temple.
c88762	We will cry out to You in our distress,
c88763	and You will hear us
c88764	and deliver us.’
c88765	And now,
c88766	here are the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir,
c88767	whom You did not let Israel
c88768	invade
c88769	when they came out of Egypt;
c88770	but Israel turned away from them
c88771	and did not destroy them.
c88772	See how they are repaying us
c88773	by coming
c88774	to drive us out of the possession
c88775	that You gave us as an inheritance.
c88776	O our God,
c88777	will You not judge them?
c88778	For we are powerless before this vast army
c88779	that comes against us.
c88780	We do not know
c88781	what to do,
c88782	but our eyes [are] upon You.”
c88783	Meanwhile all [the men] of Judah, ... were standing before the LORD.
c88784	with their wives and children and little ones,
c88785	Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite from Asaph’s descendants,
c88786	Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon ... [as he stood] in the midst of the assembly.
c88787	And he said,
c88788	“Listen,
c88789	all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Listen, King Jehoshaphat!
c88790	This is what the LORD says:
c88791	‘Do not be afraid
c88792	or discouraged because of this vast army,
c88793	for the battle does not belong to you,
c88794	but to God.
c88795	Tomorrow you are to march down against them.
c88796	You will see them coming up the Ascent of Ziz,
c88797	and you will find them at the end of the valley facing the Wilderness of Jeruel.
c88798	You need not
c88799	fight this [battle].
c88800	Take up your positions,
c88801	stand firm,
c88802	and see the salvation of the LORD on your behalf,
c88803	O Judah and Jerusalem.
c88804	Do not be afraid
c88805	or discouraged.
c88806	Go out and face them tomorrow,
c88807	for the LORD is with you.’”
c88808	Then Jehoshaphat bowed
c88809	with his face to the ground,
c88810	and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down before the LORD
c88811	to worship Him.
c88812	And the Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up
c88813	to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, shouting in a very loud voice.
c88814	Early in the morning they got up
c88815	and left for the Wilderness of Tekoa.
c88817	As they set out,
c88818	Jehoshaphat stood up
c88819	and said,
c88820	“Hear me,
c88821	O people of Judah and Jerusalem.
c88822	Believe in the LORD your God,
c88823	and you will be upheld;
c88824	believe in His prophets,
c88825	and you will succeed.”
c88826	Then [Jehoshaphat] consulted with the people
c88827	and appointed those
c88828	who would sing to the LORD
c88829	and praise the splendor of His holiness.
c88830	As they went out before the army,
c88831	they were singing:
c88832	“Give thanks to the LORD,
c88833	for His loving devotion endures forever.”
c88834	The moment
c88835	they began their shouts and praises,
c88836	the LORD set an ambush against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir
c88837	who had come against Judah,
c88838	and they were defeated.
c88839	The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir,
c88840	destroying
c88841	[them] completely.
c88843	And when they had made an end to the inhabitants of Seir,
c88844	they helped
c88845	one another.
c88846	to destroy
c88847	When the men of Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness,
c88848	they looked for the vast army,
c88849	but there were only corpses
c88850	lying on the ground;
c88851	no one had escaped.
c88852	Then Jehoshaphat and his people went
c88853	to carry off the plunder,
c88854	and they found ... an abundance
c88855	on the bodies ... of goods and valuables—
c88856	more than they could carry away.
c88857	They were gathering the plunder for three days
c88858	because there was so much.
c88859	On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah,
c88860	where they blessed the LORD.
c88861	Therefore that place is called the Valley of Beracah to this day.
c88862	Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem,
c88863	with Jehoshaphat at their head,
c88864	returned joyfully to Jerusalem,
c88865	for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies.
c88866	So they entered Jerusalem and went into the house of the LORD with harps, lyres, and trumpets.
c88867	And the fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the lands
c88868	when they heard
c88869	that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
c88870	Then Jehoshaphat’s kingdom was at peace,
c88871	for his God had given him rest on every side.
c88872	So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah.
c88873	He [was] thirty-five years old
c88874	when he became king,
c88875	and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years.
c88876	His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
c88877	And [Jehoshaphat] walked in the way of his father Asa
c88878	and did not turn away from it;
c88879	he did
c88880	what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
c88881	The high places, however, were not removed;
c88882	the people had not yet set their hearts on the God of their fathers.
c88883	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from beginning to end,
c88884	they are indeed written in the Chronicles of Jehu son of Hanani,
c88885	which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
c88886	Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel,
c88887	who ... wickedly.
c88888	acted
c88889	They agreed
c88890	to make ships
c88891	to go to Tarshish,
c88892	and these were built in Ezion-geber.
c88893	Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat,
c88894	saying,
c88895	“Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah,
c88896	the LORD has destroyed your works.”
c88897	So the ships were wrecked
c88898	and were unable
c88899	to sail to Tarshish.
c88900	Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers
c88901	and was buried with [them] in the City of David.
c88902	And his son Jehoram became king in his place.
c88903	Jehoram's brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, [were] Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah;
c88904	these [were] all sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.
c88905	Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and precious things, as well as the fortified cities in Judah;
c88906	but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram
c88907	because he was the firstborn.
c88908	When Jehoram had established himself over his father’s kingdom,
c88909	he strengthened himself
c88910	by putting to the sword all his brothers
c88911	along with [some] of the princes of Israel.
c88912	Jehoram [was] thirty-two years old
c88913	when he became king,
c88914	and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
c88915	And [Jehoram] walked in the way of the kings of Israel,
c88916	just as the house of Ahab had done.
c88917	For he married a daughter of Ahab
c88918	and did
c88919	evil in the sight of the LORD.
c88920	Yet the LORD was unwilling
c88921	to destroy the house ... with David,
c88922	because of the covenant
c88923	of David ... He had made ... and since
c88924	He had promised
c88925	to maintain a lamp for David
c88926	and his descendants forever.
c88927	In the days of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against the hand of Judah
c88928	and appointed their own king.
c88929	So Jehoram crossed into Edom with his officers
c88930	and all his chariots.
c88932	he rose up ... by night.
c88933	When the Edomites ... and attacked
c88934	surrounded him
c88935	and his chariot commanders,
c88936	So to this day Edom has been in rebellion against the hand of Judah.
c88937	Likewise, Libnah rebelled against his rule at the same time,
c88938	because he had abandoned the LORD, the God of his fathers.
c88939	Jehoram had also built high places on the hills of Judah;
c88940	he had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves
c88941	and had led Judah astray.
c88942	Then a letter came to [Jehoram] from Elijah the prophet,
c88943	which stated:
c88944	“This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says:
c88945	‘You have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat [or] of Asa king of Judah,
c88946	but you have walked in the way of the kings of Israel
c88947	and have caused Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves
c88948	just as the house of Ahab prostituted itself.
c88949	You have also ... your brothers, your father’s family,
c88950	who were better than you.
c88951	killed
c88952	So behold, the LORD is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives, and all your possessions with a serious blow.
c88953	you yourself will suffer from a severe illness, a disease of your bowels,
c88954	And day after day ... until [it] causes your bowels to come out.’”
c88955	Then the LORD stirred against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabs ... lived near
c88956	who ... the Cushites.
c88957	So they went to war against Judah,
c88958	invaded it,
c88959	and carried off all the possessions
c88960	found in the king’s palace,
c88961	along with his sons and wives;
c88962	not a son was left
c88963	to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest.
c88964	After all this, the LORD afflicted [Jehoram] with an incurable disease of the bowels.
c88965	This continued day after day
c88967	until two full years passed. Finally,
c88968	his intestines came out because of his disease,
c88969	and he died in severe pain.
c88970	And his people did not make a fire in his honor as they had done for his fathers.
c88971	Jehoram was thirty-two years old
c88972	when he became king,
c88973	and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
c88974	He died, to no one’s regret,
c88975	and was buried in the City of David,
c88976	but not in the tombs of the kings.
c88977	Then the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, the youngest son [of Jehoram], king in his place,
c88978	since the raiders ... had killed all the older sons.
c88979	who had come into the camp with the Arabs
c88980	So Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah.
c88981	Ahaziah [was] twenty-two years old
c88982	when he became king,
c88983	and he reigned in Jerusalem one year.
c88984	His mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri.
c88985	Ahaziah also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab,
c88986	for his mother was his counselor
c88987	in wickedness.
c88988	And he did
c88989	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c88990	as the house of Ahab [had done],
c88991	for to his destruction they were his counselors after the death of his father.
c88992	[Ahaziah] also followed their counsel
c88993	and went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to fight against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead.
c88994	But the Arameans wounded Joram;
c88995	so he returned
c88996	to Jezreel to recover
c88997	from the wounds
c88998	they had inflicted on him at Ramah
c88999	when he fought against Hazael king of Aram.
c89000	Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down
c89001	to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab,
c89002	since Joram had been wounded.
c89003	Ahaziah’s downfall came from God
c89004	when he went to visit Joram.
c89006	When Ahaziah arrived,
c89007	he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi,
c89008	whom the LORD had anointed
c89009	to destroy the house of Ahab.
c89011	So while Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab,
c89012	he found the rulers of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers
c89013	who were serving Ahaziah,
c89014	and he killed them.
c89015	Then Jehu looked for Ahaziah,
c89016	and Jehu’s soldiers captured
c89017	him while he was hiding in Samaria.
c89018	So they brought Ahaziah to Jehu
c89019	and killed him.
c89020	They buried him,
c89021	for they said,
c89022	“He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat,
c89023	who sought the LORD with all his heart.”
c89024	So no one [was left] from the house of Ahaziah
c89025	with the strength to rule the kingdom.
c89026	When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw
c89027	that her son was dead,
c89028	she proceeded
c89029	to annihilate all the royal heirs of the house of Judah.
c89030	But Jehoshabeath daughter of King [Jehoram] [took] Joash son of Ahaziah
c89031	and stole him away from among the sons of the king
c89032	[who were] being murdered,
c89033	and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom.
c89034	Because Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest, ... she hid Joash
c89035	was Ahaziah’s sister,
c89036	from Athaliah
c89037	so that she could not kill him.
c89038	And [Joash] remained ... with them in the house of God
c89039	hidden ... for six years
c89040	while Athaliah ruled the land.
c89041	Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada strengthened himself
c89042	and made a covenant with the commanders of hundreds: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.
c89043	So they went throughout Judah
c89044	and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah
c89045	and the heads of the families of Israel.
c89046	And when they came to Jerusalem,
c89047	the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God.
c89048	said Jehoiada.
c89049	“Behold, the king's son!” ... “He must reign,
c89050	just as the LORD promised concerning the descendants of David.
c89051	This
c89052	is what you are to do:
c89053	A third of you priests and Levites who come on duty on the Sabbath shall keep watch at the doors,
c89054	a third shall be at the royal palace,
c89055	and a third at the Foundation Gate,
c89056	while all the others are in the courtyards of the house of the LORD.
c89057	No one is to enter the house of the LORD
c89058	except the priests and those Levites who serve;
c89059	they may enter
c89060	because they are consecrated,
c89061	but all the people are to obey the requirement of the LORD.
c89062	The Levites must surround the king
c89064	with weapons in hand,
c89066	and anyone who enters the temple
c89067	must be put to death.
c89068	You must stay close to the king
c89069	wherever he goes.”
c89071	So the commanders of hundreds did everything
c89072	that Jehoiada the priest had ordered.
c89073	took
c89074	Each of them ... his men— those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty—
c89075	for Jehoiada the priest had not released [any of] the divisions.
c89076	Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields
c89077	of King David
c89078	that were in the house of God.
c89079	He stationed all the troops,
c89081	with their weapons in hand,
c89082	surrounding the king by the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
c89083	Then [Jehoiada and his sons] brought out the king’s son,
c89084	put the crown on him, presented him with the Testimony,
c89085	and proclaimed him king.
c89086	[They] anointed him
c89087	and shouted,
c89088	“Long live the king!”
c89089	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people
c89090	running
c89091	and cheering the king,
c89092	she went out to [them] in the house of the LORD.
c89093	And she looked out
c89094	and saw
c89095	the king, standing by his pillar at the entrance.
c89096	The officers and trumpeters were beside the king,
c89097	and all the people of the land were rejoicing
c89098	and blowing trumpets,
c89099	while the singers with musical instruments
c89100	were leading
c89101	the praises.
c89102	Then Athaliah tore her clothes
c89103	and screamed,
c89104	“Treason, treason!”
c89105	And Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of hundreds in charge of the army,
c89106	saying,
c89107	“Bring her out between the ranks,
c89109	anyone who follows her.”
c89110	and put to the sword
c89111	For the priest had said,
c89112	“She must not be put to death in the house of the LORD.”
c89113	So they seized [Athaliah]
c89114	as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate to the palace grounds,
c89115	and there they put her to death.
c89116	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the king, and the people
c89117	that they would be the LORD’s people.
c89118	So all the people went to the temple of Baal
c89119	and tore it down.
c89120	They smashed the altars and idols into pieces
c89121	and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
c89122	Moreover , Jehoiada put the oversight of the house of the LORD into the hands of the Levitical priests,
c89123	whom David had appointed over the house of the LORD,
c89124	to offer burnt offerings to the LORD
c89125	as is written in the Law of Moses,
c89126	with rejoicing and song, as ordained by David.
c89127	He stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD,
c89128	so that nothing unclean could enter for any reason.
c89129	He also took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land,
c89130	and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD
c89131	and entered the royal palace through the Upper Gate.
c89132	They seated King [Joash] on the royal throne,
c89133	and all the people of the land rejoiced.
c89134	And the city was quiet,
c89135	because Athaliah had been put to the sword.
c89136	Joash was seven years old
c89137	when he became king,
c89138	and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years.
c89139	His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.
c89140	And Joash did
c89141	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD
c89142	all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
c89143	Jehoiada took for himself two wives,
c89144	and he had sons and daughters.
c89145	Some time later,
c89146	Joash set his heart
c89147	on repairing the house of the LORD.
c89148	So he gathered the priests and Levites
c89149	and said,
c89150	“Go out to the cities of Judah
c89151	and collect the money ... from all Israel,
c89152	to repair the house of your God.
c89153	due annually
c89154	Do it quickly.”
c89155	The Levites, however, did not make haste.
c89156	So the king called Jehoiada the high
c89157	priest and said,
c89158	“Why have you not required the Levites
c89159	to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?”
c89160	For ... of that wicked woman Athaliah
c89161	the sons ... had broken into the house of God
c89162	and had even used the sacred objects of the house of the LORD for the Baals.
c89163	At the king’s command
c89164	a chest was made
c89165	and placed outside, at the gate of the house of the LORD.
c89166	And a proclamation was issued in Judah and Jerusalem
c89167	that they were to bring to the LORD the tax [imposed by] Moses the servant of God on Israel in the wilderness.
c89168	All the officers and all the people rejoiced
c89169	and brought their contributions,
c89170	and they dropped them in the chest
c89171	until it was full.
c89172	Whenever
c89173	the chest was brought by the Levites to the king’s overseers
c89174	and they saw
c89175	that there was a large amount of money,
c89176	the royal scribe and the officer of the high priest would come
c89177	and empty the chest
c89178	and carry it
c89179	back to its place.
c89180	They did this daily
c89181	and gathered the money in abundance.
c89182	Then the king and Jehoiada would give [the money] of those who supervised the labor on the house of the LORD
c89183	to hire stonecutters and carpenters
c89184	to restore the house of the LORD
c89185	and workers in iron and bronze
c89186	to repair the house of the LORD.
c89187	So the workmen labored,
c89188	and in their hands the repair work progressed.
c89189	They restored the house of God according to its specifications,
c89190	and they reinforced it.
c89192	When they had finished,
c89193	they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada
c89194	to make with it the articles for the house of the LORD— utensils for the service and for the burnt offerings, dishes, and other objects of gold and silver.
c89195	Throughout the days of Jehoiada, burnt offerings were presented regularly in the house of the LORD.
c89196	When Jehoiada was old ... [he]
c89197	and full of years,
c89198	died
c89199	at the age of 130.
c89200	And [Jehoiada] was buried with the kings in the City of David,
c89201	because he had done what was good in Israel for God and His temple.
c89202	After the death of Jehoiada, however, the officials of Judah came
c89203	and paid homage to the king,
c89204	and [he] listened to them.
c89205	They abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers,
c89206	and served the Asherah poles and idols.
c89207	So wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs.
c89208	Nevertheless, [the LORD] sent prophets
c89209	to bring [the people] back to [Him]
c89210	and to testify against them;
c89211	but they would not listen.
c89212	Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest,
c89213	who stood up before the people
c89214	and said to them,
c89215	“This is what God says:
c89216	‘Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD
c89217	so that you cannot prosper?
c89218	Because you have forsaken the LORD,
c89219	He has forsaken you.’
c89220	But they conspired against Zechariah,
c89221	and by order of the king, they stoned him in the courtyard of the house of the LORD.
c89222	Thus King Joash failed to remember the kindness
c89223	that Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had extended to him.
c89224	Instead, [Joash] killed [Jehoiada's] son.
c89225	As he lay dying, [Zechariah] said,
c89226	“May the LORD see this
c89227	and call you to account.”
c89228	At the turn of the year,
c89229	the army of Aram went to war against Joash.
c89230	They entered Judah and Jerusalem
c89231	and destroyed all the leaders of the people,
c89232	and they sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus.
c89233	Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men,
c89234	the LORD delivered into their hand a very great army,
c89235	because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.
c89236	Thus they executed judgment on Joash.
c89238	And when [the Arameans] had withdrawn,
c89239	they left [Joash] severely wounded.
c89240	His own servants conspired against him for shedding the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest,
c89241	and they killed him on his bed.
c89242	So he died
c89243	and was buried in the City of David,
c89244	but not in the tombs of the kings.
c89245	Those
c89246	who conspired against [Joash]
c89247	were Zabad son of the Ammonite woman Shimeath as well as Jehozabad son of the Moabite woman Shimrith.
c89248	The accounts of the sons [of Joash],
c89249	as well as the many oracles about him
c89250	and about the restoration of the house of God,
c89251	they [are] indeed written in the Treatise of the Book of the Kings.
c89252	And his son Amaziah became king in his place.
c89253	Amaziah was twenty-five years old [when] he became king,
c89254	and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years.
c89255	His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.
c89256	And he did [what was]
c89257	right in the eyes of the LORD,
c89258	but not wholeheartedly.
c89260	As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp,
c89261	Amaziah executed the servants
c89262	who had murdered his father the king.
c89263	Yet he did not put their sons to death,
c89265	according to what is written in the Law, in the book of Moses,
c89266	where the LORD commanded:
c89268	“Fathers must not be put to death for their children,
c89269	and children must not be put to death for their fathers;
c89271	each ... for his own sin.”
c89272	is to die
c89273	Then Amaziah gathered [the people of] Judah
c89274	and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands [and] of hundreds. ... throughout Judah and Benjamin
c89275	And he numbered those twenty years of age or older
c89276	and found there to be 300,000 choice [men],
c89277	[able] to serve in the army,
c89278	bearing the spear and shield.
c89279	He also hired 100,000 mighty warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
c89280	But a man of God came to him
c89281	and said,
c89282	“O king,
c89283	do not let the army of Israel go with you,
c89284	for the LORD is not with Israel— [not with] any of the Ephraimites.
c89285	Even if you go
c89286	and fight
c89287	bravely in battle,
c89288	God will make you stumble before the enemy,
c89289	for God has power
c89290	to help
c89291	and [power] to overthrow.”
c89292	Amaziah asked the man of God,
c89293	“What
c89294	should I do about the hundred talents
c89295	I have given to the army of Israel?”
c89296	And the man of God replied,
c89297	“The LORD
c89298	is able to give you much more than this.”
c89299	So Amaziah dismissed the troops
c89300	who had come to him from Ephraim
c89301	and sent them home.
c89302	And they were furious with Judah
c89303	and returned home in great anger.
c89304	Amaziah, however, summoned his strength
c89305	and led his troops
c89306	to the Valley of Salt,
c89307	where he struck down 10,000 men of Seir,
c89308	and the army of Judah also captured 10,000men alive.
c89309	They took them to the top of a cliff
c89310	and threw them down
c89311	so that all were dashed to pieces.
c89312	Meanwhile the troops
c89313	that Amaziah had dismissed
c89314	from battle
c89315	raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon.
c89316	They struck down 3,000people
c89317	and carried off a great deal of plunder.
c89319	After Amaziah returned
c89320	from the slaughter of the Edomites,
c89321	he brought back the gods of the Seirites,
c89322	set them up as his own gods,
c89323	bowed before them,
c89324	and burned sacrifices to them.
c89325	Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah,
c89326	and He sent him a prophet
c89327	who said,
c89328	“Why have you sought this people's gods,
c89329	which could not deliver [them] from your hand?”
c89331	While he was still speaking,
c89332	the king asked,
c89333	“Have we made you the counselor to the king?
c89334	Stop!
c89335	Why be struck down?”
c89336	So the prophet stopped,
c89337	but he said,
c89338	“I know
c89339	that God has determined
c89340	to destroy you,
c89341	because you have done this
c89342	and have not listened to my advice.”
c89343	Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel
c89344	and sent word to the king of Israel, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu.
c89345	he said.
c89346	“Come,
c89347	let us meet face to face,”
c89348	But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah:
c89350	“A thistle
c89351	in Lebanon
c89352	sent a message to a cedar
c89353	in Lebanon,
c89354	saying,
c89355	‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’
c89356	Then a wild beast ... came along
c89357	in Lebanon
c89358	and trampled the thistle.
c89359	You have said,
c89360	‘Look, I have defeated Edom,’
c89361	and your heart has become proud
c89362	and boastful.
c89363	Now stay at home.
c89364	Why should you stir up trouble
c89365	so that you fall— you
c89366	and Judah with you?”
c89367	But Amaziah would not listen,
c89368	for this [had come] from God
c89369	in order to deliver them into the hand [of Jehoash],
c89370	because they had sought the gods of Edom.
c89371	So Jehoash king of Israel advanced,
c89372	and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth-shemesh
c89373	in Judah.
c89374	And Judah was routed before Israel,
c89375	fled
c89376	and every man ... to his own home.
c89377	There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz.
c89378	Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem
c89379	and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to ... Gate—
c89380	the Corner
c89381	[a section of] four hundred cubits.
c89382	He took all the gold and silver and all the articles
c89383	found in the house of God with Obed-edom
c89384	and in the treasuries of the royal palace, as well as some hostages.
c89385	Then he returned to Samaria.
c89386	Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
c89387	As for the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from beginning to end,
c89388	are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?
c89389	From the time
c89390	that Amaziah turned from following the LORD,
c89391	a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem,
c89392	and he fled to Lachish.
c89393	But men were sent after him to Lachish,
c89394	and they killed him there.
c89395	They carried him back on horses
c89396	and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
c89397	All the people of Judah took Uzziah,
c89398	who [was] sixteen years old,
c89399	and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
c89400	[Uzziah was the one] who rebuilt Eloth
c89401	and restored it to Judah
c89402	after King [Amaziah] rested with his fathers.
c89403	Uzziah was sixteen years old
c89404	when he became king,
c89405	and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years.
c89406	His mother’s name was Jecoliah; [she was] from Jerusalem.
c89407	And he did
c89408	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD,
c89409	just as
c89410	his father Amaziah had done.
c89412	He sought God throughout the days of Zechariah,
c89413	who instructed him
c89414	in the fear of God.
c89415	And as long as
c89416	he sought the LORD,
c89417	God gave him success.
c89418	Uzziah went out
c89419	to wage war against the Philistines,
c89420	and he tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod.
c89421	Then he built cities near Ashdod and among the Philistines.
c89422	God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs
c89423	living in Gur-baal,
c89424	and against the Meunites.
c89425	The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah,
c89426	and his fame spread
c89427	as far as the border of Egypt,
c89428	for he had become exceedingly powerful.
c89429	Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the angle in the wall,
c89430	and he fortified them.
c89431	he built towers in the desert
c89432	much ... and dug ... cisterns.
c89433	Since he had ... livestock ... many
c89434	in the foothills and in the plain,
c89435	he had farmers and vinedressers in the hill country and in the fertile fields.
c89436	And since he was a lover of the soil,
c89437	Uzziah had an army
c89438	ready for battle
c89439	that went out to war by assigned divisions, as recorded by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officers.
c89440	The total number of heads of families was 2,600 mighty warriors.
c89441	Under their authority ... of 307,500
c89442	was an army ... equipped for combat, a powerful force
c89443	to support the king against his enemies.
c89444	Uzziah supplied the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and slingstones.
c89445	And in Jerusalem he made ... devices
c89446	skillfully designed
c89447	[from] the towers and corners.
c89448	to shoot arrows and catapult large stones
c89449	So his fame spread far [and wide],
c89450	for he was marvelously
c89451	helped
c89452	until he became powerful.
c89453	But when [Uzziah] grew powerful, his arrogance
c89454	led to his own destruction.
c89455	He was unfaithful to the LORD his God,
c89456	for he entered the temple of the LORD
c89457	to burn incense on the altar of incense.
c89458	Then Azariah the priest, ... went in after him.
c89459	along with eighty brave priests of the LORD,
c89460	They took their stand against King Uzziah
c89461	and said,
c89462	you have no
c89463	“Uzziah,
c89464	right to offer incense to the LORD.
c89465	Only the priests, the descendants of Aaron,
c89466	are consecrated
c89467	to burn incense.
c89468	Leave the sanctuary,
c89469	for you have acted unfaithfully;
c89470	you will not receive honor from the LORD God.”
c89471	Uzziah, ... was enraged.
c89472	with a censer in his hand
c89473	to offer incense,
c89474	But while he raged against the priests
c89475	in their presence in the house of the LORD before the altar of incense, leprosy broke out on his forehead.
c89476	When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him
c89477	and saw
c89478	his leprous forehead,
c89479	they rushed him out.
c89480	Indeed, he himself hurried
c89481	to get out,
c89482	because the LORD had afflicted him.
c89483	So King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death.
c89484	He lived in isolation,
c89485	leprous
c89486	and cut off from the house of the LORD,
c89487	while his son Jotham had charge of the royal palace
c89488	to govern the people of the land.
c89489	As for the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from beginning to end, they are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
c89490	And Uzziah rested with his fathers
c89491	and was buried near [them] in the field of burial
c89492	which [belonged] to the kings;
c89493	for [the people] said,
c89494	“He [was] a leper.”
c89495	And his son Jotham became king in his place.
c89496	Jotham was twenty-five years old
c89497	when he became king,
c89498	and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
c89499	His mother’s name was Jerushah daughter of Zadok.
c89500	And he did
c89501	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD,
c89502	just as
c89503	his father Uzziah had done.
c89504	In addition, he did not enter the temple of the LORD.
c89505	But the people still behaved corruptly.
c89506	Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD,
c89507	and he worked extensively on the wall at Ophel.
c89508	He also built cities in the hill country of Judah
c89509	and fortresses and towers in the forests.
c89510	[Jotham] waged war against the king of the Ammonites
c89511	and defeated them,
c89512	and that year they gave him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand [kors] of barley.
c89513	They paid him the same
c89514	in the second and third years.
c89515	So Jotham grew powerful
c89516	because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.
c89517	As for the rest of the acts of Jotham, along with all his wars and his ways,
c89518	they [are] indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
c89519	He was twenty-five years old
c89520	when he became king,
c89521	and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
c89522	And Jotham rested with his fathers
c89523	and was buried in the City of David.
c89524	And his son Ahaz became king in his place.
c89525	Ahaz was twenty years old
c89526	when he became king,
c89527	and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
c89528	he did not do
c89529	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD.
c89530	And unlike David his forefather,
c89531	Instead, he walked in the way of the kings of Israel
c89532	and even made cast images of the Baals.
c89533	Moreover, Ahaz burned incense in the Valley of Hinnom ... his sons
c89534	and sacrificed ... in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations
c89535	whom the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
c89536	And he sacrificed
c89537	and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
c89538	So the LORD his God delivered Ahaz into the hand of the king of Aram,
c89539	who attacked
c89540	him and took many captives
c89541	to Damascus.
c89542	Ahaz was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel,
c89543	who struck him with great force.
c89544	For in one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 ... in Judah.
c89545	valiant men
c89546	[This happened] because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.
c89547	Zichri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the son of the king, Azrikam the governor of the palace, and Elkanah the second to the king.
c89548	Then the Israelites took 200,000 captives from their kinsmen— women, sons, and daughters.
c89549	They also carried off a great deal of plunder
c89550	and brought it to Samaria.
c89551	But a prophet of the LORD ... was there,
c89552	named Oded
c89553	and he went out to meet the army
c89554	that returned to Samaria.
c89555	he said to them,
c89556	“Look,” ... “because of His wrath against Judah, the LORD, the God of your fathers, has delivered them into your hands.
c89557	But you have slaughtered them in a rage
c89558	[that] reaches up to heaven.
c89559	And now ... of Judah and Jerusalem.
c89560	you intend
c89561	to reduce to slavery the men and women
c89562	But are you not also
c89563	guilty before the LORD your God?
c89564	Now therefore,
c89565	listen to me
c89566	and return the captives
c89567	you took from your kinsmen,
c89568	for the fierce anger of the LORD is upon you.”
c89569	Then some of the leaders of the Ephraimites— Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai— stood
c89570	in opposition to those arriving from the war.
c89571	they said,
c89572	“You must not bring the captives here,”
c89573	“for you are proposing to bring guilt upon us from the LORD
c89574	and to add to our sins and our guilt. ... is upon
c89575	For our guilt is great,
c89576	and fierce anger ... Israel.”
c89577	So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the leaders and all the assembly.
c89578	Then the men ... arose,
c89579	who were designated by name
c89580	took charge of the captives,
c89581	and provided from the plunder clothing for the naked.
c89582	They clothed them,
c89583	gave them sandals
c89584	and food
c89585	and drink,
c89586	anointed [their wounds],
c89587	and put all the feeble on donkeys.
c89588	So they brought them to Jericho, the City of Palms, to their brothers.
c89589	Then they returned to Samaria.
c89590	At that time King Ahaz sent ... from the king of Assyria.
c89591	for help
c89592	The Edomites had again come
c89593	and attacked Judah
c89594	and carried away captives.
c89595	The Philistines had also raided the cities of the foothills and the Negev of Judah,
c89596	capturing ... Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, as well as Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo with their villages.
c89597	and occupying
c89598	For the LORD humbled Judah because Ahaz king of Israel
c89599	had thrown off restraint in Judah
c89600	and had been most unfaithful to the LORD.
c89601	Then Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came to Ahaz
c89602	but afflicted him
c89603	rather than strengthening him.
c89604	Although Ahaz had taken a portion from the house of the LORD, from the royal palace, and from the princes
c89605	and had presented [it] to the king of Assyria,
c89606	it did not help him.
c89607	In the time
c89608	of his distress,
c89609	became even more
c89610	unfaithful to the LORD.
c89611	King Ahaz
c89612	He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus,
c89613	which had defeated him,
c89614	for he thought,
c89615	“Since the gods of the kings of Aram
c89616	have helped them, ... But these
c89617	I will sacrifice to them
c89618	that they may help me.”
c89619	were
c89620	the downfall of [Ahaz]
c89621	and of all Israel.
c89622	Then Ahaz gathered up the articles of the house of God,
c89623	cut them into pieces,
c89624	shut the doors of the house of the LORD,
c89625	and set up altars of his own on every street corner in Jerusalem.
c89626	In every city of Judah he built high places
c89627	to offer incense to other gods,
c89628	and so he provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers.
c89629	As for the rest of the acts [of Ahaz] and all his ways, from beginning to end,
c89630	they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
c89631	And Ahaz rested with his fathers
c89632	and was buried in the city of Jerusalem,
c89633	but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel.
c89634	And his son Hezekiah became king in his place.
c89635	Hezekiah [was] twenty-five years old when he became king,
c89636	and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years.
c89637	His mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
c89638	And he did
c89639	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD,
c89640	just as
c89641	his father David had done.
c89642	of the first year
c89643	of his reign,
c89644	In the first month ... [Hezekiah] opened ... the doors of the house of the LORD.
c89645	and repaired
c89646	Then he brought in the priests and Levites
c89647	and gathered them in the square on the east side.
c89648	he said.
c89649	“Listen to me,
c89650	O Levites,”
c89651	“Consecrate yourselves now
c89652	and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers.
c89653	Remove from the Holy Place every impurity.
c89654	For our fathers were unfaithful
c89655	and did
c89656	evil in the sight of the LORD our God.
c89657	They abandoned Him,
c89658	turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD,
c89659	and turned their backs on Him.
c89660	They also shut the doors of the portico
c89661	and extinguished the lamps.
c89662	They did not burn incense
c89663	[or] present burnt offerings in the Holy Place of the God of Israel.
c89664	Therefore, the wrath of the LORD has fallen upon Judah and Jerusalem,
c89665	and He has made them an object of terror, horror, and mockery,
c89666	as you can see with your own eyes.
c89667	For behold, ... our fathers have fallen by the sword,
c89668	this is why ... and our sons and daughters and wives are in captivity.
c89669	Now it is in my heart
c89670	to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel,
c89671	so that His fierce anger will turn away from us.
c89672	my sons,
c89673	Now, ... do not be negligent,
c89674	for the LORD has chosen you
c89675	to stand before Him,
c89676	to serve Him,
c89677	to minister before Him,
c89678	and to burn incense.”
c89679	Then the Levites set to work:
c89680	Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohathites;
c89681	Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Merarites;
c89682	Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershonites;
c89683	Shimri and Jeuel from the Elizaphanites;
c89684	Zechariah and Mattaniah from the Asaphites;
c89685	Jehiel and Shimei from the Hemanites;
c89686	[and] Shemaiah and Uzziel from the Jeduthunites.
c89687	When they had assembled their brothers
c89688	and consecrated themselves,
c89689	they went in ... according to the command of the king by the words of the LORD.
c89690	to cleanse the house of the LORD,
c89691	So the priests went inside the house of the LORD
c89692	to cleanse [it],
c89693	and they brought out ... all the unclean things
c89694	that they found in the temple of the LORD.
c89695	to the courtyard
c89696	Then the Levites took [these things]
c89697	and carried [them] out to the Kidron Valley.
c89698	They began ... on the first day of the first month,
c89699	the consecration
c89700	and on the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the LORD.
c89701	For eight [more] days they consecrated the house of the LORD [itself],
c89702	finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.
c89703	Then they went in to King Hezekiah
c89704	and reported,
c89705	“We have cleansed the entire house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table of the showbread with all its utensils.
c89706	Moreover, ... all the articles
c89707	that King Ahaz in his unfaithfulness cast aside during his reign.
c89708	we have prepared
c89709	and consecrated
c89710	They are now in front of the altar of the LORD.”
c89711	Early the next morning King Hezekiah
c89712	gathered the city officials
c89713	and went up to the house of the LORD.
c89714	They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah.
c89715	And [the king] commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron,
c89716	to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
c89717	So they slaughtered the bulls,
c89718	and the priests took the blood
c89719	and sprinkled it on the altar.
c89720	They slaughtered the rams
c89721	and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
c89722	And they slaughtered the lambs
c89723	and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
c89724	Then they brought the goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly,
c89725	who laid their hands on them.
c89726	And the priests slaughtered the goats
c89727	and put their blood on the altar for a sin offering,
c89728	to make atonement for all Israel,
c89729	for the king had ordered that the burnt offering and sin offering were for all Israel.
c89730	Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres according to the command of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet.
c89731	For the command had come from the LORD through His prophets.
c89732	The Levites stood with the instruments of David,
c89733	and the priests with the trumpets.
c89734	And Hezekiah ordered
c89735	that the burnt offering be sacrificed on the altar.
c89736	When
c89737	the burnt offering began,
c89738	the song of the LORD and the trumpets began as well,
c89739	accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel.
c89740	The whole assembly was worshiping,
c89741	the singers were singing,
c89742	and the trumpeters were playing.
c89743	All this
c89744	continued until the burnt offering was completed.
c89746	were completed,
c89747	When the offerings
c89748	the king and all ... him bowed down
c89749	those present with
c89750	and worshiped.
c89751	Then King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites
c89752	to sing praises to the LORD in the words of David and of Asaph the seer.
c89753	So they sang praises with gladness
c89754	and bowed their heads
c89755	and worshiped.
c89756	Then Hezekiah
c89757	said,
c89758	“Now [that] you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD,
c89759	come near
c89760	and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.”
c89761	So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings,
c89762	and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings.
c89763	The number of burnt offerings ... was
c89764	the assembly brought
c89765	seventy bulls, a hundred rams, [and] two hundred lambs;
c89766	all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
c89767	And the consecrated offerings [were] six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
c89768	However, since there were not enough priests
c89770	to skin all the burnt offerings,
c89771	their Levite brothers helped
c89772	them until the work was finished
c89773	and until the priests had been consecrated.
c89774	For the Levites had been more diligent
c89775	in consecrating themselves
c89776	than the priests had been.
c89777	Furthermore, the burnt offerings were abundant, along with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for the burnt offering.
c89778	So the service of the house of the LORD was established.
c89779	Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced
c89780	at what God had prepared for the people,
c89781	because everything had been accomplished so quickly.
c89782	Then Hezekiah sent word throughout all Israel and Judah,
c89783	and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh
c89784	inviting them to come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem
c89785	to keep the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel.
c89786	For the king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem had decided
c89787	to keep the Passover in the second month,
c89788	since they had been unable
c89789	to observe it at the regular time,
c89790	because not enough priests had consecrated themselves
c89791	and the people had not been gathered in Jerusalem.
c89792	The proposal pleased the king and all the assembly.
c89793	So they established a decree
c89794	to circulate a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan,
c89795	that the people should come
c89796	to keep the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel, in Jerusalem.
c89797	For they had not observed it as a nation as prescribed.
c89798	So the couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his officials,
c89801	which read:
c89802	“Children of Israel,
c89803	return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
c89804	so that He may return to ... who have escaped
c89805	those of you who remain, ... the grasp of the kings of Assyria.
c89806	Do not be like your fathers and brothers
c89807	who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their fathers,
c89808	so that He made them an object of horror,
c89809	as you can see.
c89810	Now do not stiffen your neck as your fathers [did].
c89811	Submit to the LORD
c89812	and come to His sanctuary
c89813	which He has consecrated forever.
c89814	Serve the LORD your God,
c89815	so that His fierce anger will turn away from you.
c89816	For
c89817	if you return to the LORD,
c89818	your brothers and sons will receive mercy in the presence of their captors
c89819	and will return to this land.
c89820	For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful;
c89821	He will not turn His face away from you
c89822	if you return to Him.”
c89823	And the couriers traveled from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun;
c89824	but the people scorned
c89825	and mocked them.
c89826	Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled
c89827	themselves and came to Jerusalem.
c89828	Also, the power of God was on the people in Judah
c89829	to give them one heart
c89830	to obey the command of the king and his officials according to the word of the LORD.
c89831	gathered in Jerusalem
c89832	In the second month, ... to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
c89833	a very great assembly
c89834	They proceeded
c89835	to remove the altars
c89836	in Jerusalem
c89837	and to take away the incense altars
c89838	and throw them into the Kidron Valley.
c89839	And on the fourteenth day of the second month they slaughtered the Passover lamb.
c89840	The priests and Levites were ashamed,
c89841	and they consecrated themselves
c89842	and brought burnt offerings to the house of the LORD.
c89843	They stood at their prescribed posts, according to the law of Moses, the man of God.
c89844	The priests sprinkled the blood, [which they received] from the hand of the Levites.
c89845	Since there were many in the assembly
c89846	who had not consecrated themselves,
c89847	the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for every
c89848	unclean person
c89849	to consecrate [the lambs] to the LORD.
c89850	A large number of the people— many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun— had not purified themselves, yet
c89851	they ate the Passover, ... But
c89852	contrary to what was written.
c89853	Hezekiah interceded for them,
c89854	saying,
c89855	“May the LORD, who is good, provide atonement for everyone
c89856	who
c89857	sets his heart
c89858	on seeking God— the LORD, the God of his fathers—
c89859	even if [he is] not [cleansed] according to the purification rules of the sanctuary.”
c89860	And the LORD heard Hezekiah
c89861	and healed the people.
c89862	The Israelites ... celebrated
c89863	who were present in Jerusalem
c89864	the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy,
c89865	and the Levites and priests praised the LORD day after day accompanied by loud instruments to the LORD.
c89866	And Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites
c89867	who performed skillfully before the LORD.
c89868	For seven days they ate their assigned portion,
c89869	sacrificing fellowship offerings
c89870	and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
c89871	The whole assembly agreed
c89872	to observe seven more days,
c89873	so they observed seven days with joy.
c89874	For Hezekiah king of Judah contributed a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the assembly,
c89875	and the officials contributed a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep for the assembly,
c89876	and a great number priests consecrated themselves.
c89877	Then the whole assembly of Judah rejoiced along with the priests and Levites and all the assembly
c89878	that had come from Israel,
c89879	including the foreigners
c89880	who had come from Israel
c89881	and those who lived in Judah.
c89882	So there was great rejoicing in Jerusalem,
c89883	for nothing like this [had happened] since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel.
c89884	Then the priests and the Levites stood
c89885	to bless the people,
c89886	and God heard their voice,
c89887	and their prayer came into His holy dwelling place in heaven.
c89889	When all this had ended,
c89890	the Israelites ... went out
c89891	in attendance
c89892	to the cities of Judah
c89893	and broke up the sacred pillars,
c89894	chopped down the Asherah poles,
c89895	and tore down the high places and altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh,
c89896	until they had utterly destroyed them all.
c89897	Then all the Israelites returned
c89898	to their cities, each to his own property.
c89899	Hezekiah reestablished the divisions of the priests and Levites—
c89900	each corresponding to their service
c89901	among the priests and Levites— for the burnt offerings and peace offerings,
c89902	for ministry,
c89903	for giving thanks,
c89904	and for singing praises at the gates of the LORD's dwelling.
c89905	The king contributed from his own possessions for the regular morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts,
c89906	as written in the Law of the LORD.
c89907	Moreover, he commanded the people living in Jerusalem
c89908	to make a contribution for the priests and Levites
c89909	so that they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD.
c89911	As soon as the order went out,
c89912	the Israelites generously provided the firstfruits of the grain, new wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field,
c89913	and they brought in an abundance, a tithe of everything.
c89914	And the Israelites and Judahites
c89915	who lived in the cities of Judah
c89916	also ... a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things
c89917	consecrated to the LORD their God,
c89918	brought
c89919	and they laid them in large heaps.
c89920	In the third month they began ... the heaps,
c89921	building up
c89922	and they finished in the seventh month.
c89923	When Hezekiah and his officials came
c89924	and viewed the heaps,
c89925	they blessed the LORD and His people Israel.
c89926	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites about the heaps,
c89927	and Azariah, the chief priest of the household of Zadok, answered him,
c89929	“Since [the people] began
c89930	their contributions
c89931	to bring ... into the house of the LORD,
c89932	to eat
c89933	we have had enough
c89934	and there is plenty left over,
c89935	because the LORD has blessed His people;
c89936	this great abundance is what is left over.”
c89937	Then Hezekiah commanded
c89938	them to prepare storerooms in the house of the LORD,
c89939	and they did so.
c89940	And they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes, and dedicated gifts.
c89941	Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them,
c89942	and his brother Shimei was second.
c89943	Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah [were] overseers under the authority of Conaniah and his brother Shimei, by appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah the chief official of the house of God.
c89944	Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God,
c89945	distributing the contributions to the LORD and the consecrated gifts.
c89946	Under his authority Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests faithfully
c89947	distributed to their [fellow priests] by divisions, whether large or small.
c89948	In addition, they distributed to the males registered by genealogy who were three years of age or older—
c89949	to all
c89950	who would enter the house of the LORD
c89951	for their daily duties for service in the responsibilities of their divisions.
c89952	They also distributed to the priests enrolled according to families in the genealogy,
c89953	and to the Levites twenty years of age or older, according their duties [and] divisions.
c89954	The genealogy included all the little ones, wives, sons, and daughters in the whole assembly.
c89955	For they had faithfully consecrated themselves as holy.
c89956	As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, [who lived on] the farmlands around their cities, in each and every city, men
c89957	were designated by name
c89958	to distribute a portion to every male among the priests and to every
c89959	Levite listed by the genealogies.
c89960	So this is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah.
c89961	He did what was good and upright and true before the LORD his God.
c89962	He was diligent ... work
c89963	that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law and the commandments,
c89964	in order to seek his God.
c89965	in every
c89966	And so he prospered.
c89967	After all these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came
c89968	and invaded Judah.
c89969	He laid siege to the fortified cities,
c89970	intending
c89971	to conquer them for himself.
c89972	When Hezekiah saw
c89973	that Sennacherib had come
c89974	to make war against Jerusalem,
c89975	he consulted with his leaders and commanders
c89976	about stopping up the waters of the springs
c89977	outside the city,
c89978	and they helped him carry it out.
c89979	Many people assembled
c89980	and stopped up all the springs and the stream
c89981	that flowed through the land.
c89982	they said.
c89983	“Why should the kings of Assyria come
c89984	and find plenty of water?”
c89985	Then Hezekiah worked resolutely
c89986	to rebuild all the broken sections of the wall
c89987	and to raise up towers [on it].
c89988	[He also built] an outer wall
c89989	and reinforced the supporting terraces of the City of David,
c89990	and he produced an abundance of weapons
c89991	and shields.
c89992	Hezekiah appointed military commanders over the people
c89993	and gathered the people in the square of the city gate.
c89994	Then he encouraged them,
c89995	saying,
c89996	“Be strong
c89997	and courageous!
c89998	Do not be afraid
c89999	or discouraged before the king of Assyria [and] the vast army
c90000	with him,
c90001	for there is a greater [One] with us than with him.
c90002	With him [is only] an arm of flesh,
c90003	but with us [is] the LORD our God
c90004	to help us
c90005	and to fight our battles.”
c90006	So the people were strengthened by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
c90007	Later, as Sennacherib king of Assyria ... he sent his servants to Jerusalem
c90008	besieged Lachish, ... for
c90009	and all his forces
c90010	King Hezekiah of Judah and all the people of Judah
c90011	who were in Jerusalem:
c90012	with a message
c90013	“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says:
c90014	What is the basis of your confidence,
c90015	that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?
c90016	Is not Hezekiah misleading you
c90017	to give you over
c90018	to death by famine and thirst
c90019	when he says,
c90020	‘The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?’
c90021	Did not Hezekiah himself remove His high places and His altars
c90022	and say to Judah and Jerusalem,
c90024	‘You must worship before one altar,
c90025	and on it you shall burn sacrifices’?
c90026	Do you not know
c90027	what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands?
c90028	Have the gods of these nations ever been able
c90029	to deliver their land from my hand?
c90030	Who among all the gods of these nations
c90031	that my fathers destroyed
c90032	has been able
c90033	to deliver his people from my hand.
c90034	How then can your God
c90035	deliver you from my hand?
c90036	So now,
c90037	do not let Hezekiah deceive you,
c90038	and do not let him mislead you like this.
c90039	Do not believe him,
c90040	for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able
c90041	to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers.
c90042	How much less will your God deliver you from my hand!’”
c90043	And the servants of Sennacherib spoke further against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah.
c90044	He also wrote letters
c90045	mocking the LORD, the God of Israel,
c90046	and saying against Him:
c90048	“Just as the gods of the nations
c90049	did not deliver their people from my hand,
c90050	so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.”
c90051	Then [the Assyrians] called out loudly in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem
c90052	who were on the wall,
c90053	to frighten
c90054	and terrify them
c90055	in order that to capture the city.
c90056	They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as they had spoken against the gods of the peoples of the earth— the work of human hands.
c90057	In response, King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz ... in prayer,
c90058	cried out to heaven
c90059	and the LORD sent an angel
c90060	who annihilated every mighty warrior, leader, and commander in the camp of the king of Assyria.
c90061	So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace.
c90062	And when he entered the temple of his god,
c90063	some of his own [sons] struck him down with the sword.
c90064	So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of King Sennacherib of Assyria [and] of all others,
c90065	and He gave them rest on every side.
c90066	Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD
c90067	and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah,
c90068	and from then on he was exalted in the eyes of all nations.
c90069	In those days Hezekiah ... ill.
c90070	became mortally
c90071	So he prayed to the LORD,
c90072	who spoke to him
c90073	and gave him a sign.
c90074	Hezekiah did not repay the favor [shown] to him.
c90075	But because his heart was proud,
c90076	Therefore wrath came upon him
c90077	and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
c90078	Then Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart—
c90079	he and the people of Jerusalem—
c90080	so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them during the days of Hezekiah.
c90081	Hezekiah had very great riches and honor,
c90082	and he made treasuries for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable articles.
c90083	He also made storehouses for the harvest of grain and new wine and oil,
c90084	stalls for all kinds of livestock,
c90085	and pens for the flocks.
c90086	He made cities for himself,
c90087	and he acquired herds of sheep and cattle in abundance,
c90088	for God gave him very great wealth.
c90089	It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Spring of Gihon
c90090	and channeled it down to the west side of the City of David.
c90091	And Hezekiah prospered in all that he did.
c90092	And so when ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon
c90093	were sent to him
c90094	to inquire about the wonder
c90095	that had happened in the land,
c90096	God left
c90097	him [alone] to test him,
c90098	that He might know all that was in [Hezekiah's] heart.
c90099	As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of loving devotion,
c90100	they are indeed written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
c90101	And Hezekiah rested with his fathers
c90102	and was buried in the upper tombs of David’s descendants.
c90103	All Judah and the people of Jerusalem paid him honor at his death.
c90104	And his son Manasseh became king in his place.
c90105	Manasseh was twelve years old
c90106	when he became king,
c90107	and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years.
c90108	And he did
c90109	evil in the sight of the LORD
c90110	by following the abominations of the nations
c90111	that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
c90112	For he rebuilt
c90113	the high places
c90114	that his father Hezekiah had torn down,
c90115	and he raised up altars for the Baals
c90116	and made Asherah poles.
c90117	And he worshiped ... all the host of heaven.
c90118	and served
c90119	[Manasseh] also built altars in the house of the LORD,
c90120	of which the LORD had said,
c90121	“My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.”
c90122	In both courtyards of the house of the LORD, he built altars to all the host of heaven.
c90123	He sacrificed his sons in the fire in the Valley of Hinnom.
c90124	He practiced sorcery,
c90125	divination,
c90126	and witchcraft,
c90127	and consulted mediums and spiritists.
c90128	great
c90129	He did
c90130	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c90131	provoking Him to anger.
c90132	Manasseh even took the carved image ... and set up
c90133	he had made
c90134	in the house of God,
c90135	of which God had said to David and his son Solomon,
c90136	“In this temple and in Jerusalem,
c90137	which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel,
c90138	I will establish My Name forever.
c90139	I will never again
c90140	cause the feet of the Israelites to leave the land
c90141	I assigned to your fathers,
c90142	if only they are careful
c90143	to do all
c90144	that I have commanded them through Moses— all the laws, statutes, and judgments.”
c90145	So Manasseh {led} the people of Judah and Jerusalem astray,
c90146	so that they did greater evil than the nations
c90147	the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
c90148	And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people,
c90149	but they did not listen.
c90150	So [the LORD] brought against them the military commanders
c90151	of the king of Assyria,
c90152	who captured Manasseh, put a hook in his nose,
c90153	bound him with bronze shackles,
c90154	and took him to Babylon.
c90156	And in his distress,
c90157	[Manasseh] sought the favor of the LORD his God
c90158	and earnestly humbled himself before the God of his fathers.
c90159	And when he prayed to Him,
c90160	the LORD received his plea
c90161	and heard his petition;
c90162	so He brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom.
c90163	Then Manasseh knew
c90164	that the LORD
c90165	is God.
c90166	After this, [Manasseh] rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David from west of Gihon in the valley
c90167	to the entrance of the Fish Gate,
c90168	and he brought it around the Ophel
c90169	and heightened it considerably.
c90170	He also stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah.
c90171	He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD,
c90172	along with all the altars
c90173	he had built on the temple mount and in Jerusalem,
c90174	and he dumped them outside the city.
c90175	Then he restored the altar of the LORD
c90176	and sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it,
c90177	and he told Judah
c90178	to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.
c90179	Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed at the high places,
c90180	but only to the LORD their God.
c90181	As for the rest of the acts of Manasseh, along with his prayer to his God and the words of the seers
c90182	who spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel,
c90183	they are indeed written in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
c90184	His prayer
c90185	and [how God] received his plea,
c90186	as well as all his sin and unfaithfulness, and the sites
c90187	where he built high places
c90188	and set up Asherah poles and idols
c90189	before he humbled himself,
c90190	they are indeed written in the Records of the Seers.
c90191	And Manasseh rested with his fathers
c90192	and was buried at his palace.
c90193	And his son Amon became king in his place.
c90194	Amon was twenty-two years old
c90195	when he became king,
c90196	and he reigned in Jerusalem two years.
c90197	And he did
c90198	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c90199	as his father Manasseh had done.
c90200	to all the idols
c90201	that his father Manasseh had made,
c90202	Amon ... and sacrificed
c90203	served
c90204	but he did not humble himself before the LORD
c90205	as his father Manasseh [had done];
c90206	instead, Amon increased his guilt.
c90207	Then the servants [of Amon] conspired against him
c90208	and killed him in his palace.
c90209	But the people of the land killed all
c90210	who had conspired against King Amon,
c90211	and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
c90212	Josiah was eight years old
c90213	when he became king,
c90214	and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years.
c90215	And he did
c90216	[what was] right in the eyes of the LORD
c90217	and walked in the ways of his father David;
c90218	he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.
c90219	In the eighth year
c90220	of his reign,
c90221	while he
c90222	was still young,
c90223	Josiah began
c90224	to seek the God of David his forefather,
c90225	and in the twelfth year he began
c90226	to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images.
c90227	Then in his presence the altars of the Baals were torn down,
c90228	and he cut to pieces the incense altars
c90229	that were above them.
c90231	He shattered the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images,
c90232	crushed them to dust,
c90233	and scattered them over the graves
c90234	of those who had sacrificed to them.
c90235	Then he burned the bones of the priests on their altars.
c90236	So he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
c90237	[Josiah] did the same in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali and on their surrounding ,ruins.
c90238	He tore down the altars and Asherah poles,
c90239	crushed the idols
c90240	to powder,
c90241	and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel.
c90242	Then he returned to Jerusalem.
c90243	Now in the eighteenth year
c90244	of his reign,
c90245	in order to cleanse the land and the temple,
c90246	Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder,
c90247	to repair the temple of the LORD his God.
c90248	So they went to Hilkiah the high priest
c90249	and gave him the money
c90250	that had been brought into the house of God,
c90251	which the Levites [at] the doors had collected from the [people] of Manasseh and Ephraim, from all the remnant of Israel, Judah, and Benjamin,
c90252	and from the people of Jerusalem.
c90253	They put it into the hands ... of those doing the work
c90254	of the supervisors ... of the house of the LORD,
c90255	who in turn gave it to the workmen
c90256	the house of the LORD.
c90257	restoring
c90258	and repairing
c90259	They also gave [money] to the carpenters and builders
c90260	to buy dressed stone, as well as timbers for couplings
c90261	and beams for the buildings
c90262	that the kings of Judah had allowed to deteriorate.
c90263	And the men did the work faithfully.
c90264	The Levites overseeing them were Jahath and Obadiah, descendants of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam descendants of Kohath.
c90266	[Other] Levites, all
c90267	skilled with musical instruments,
c90268	were over the laborers
c90269	and supervised all who did the work, task by task.
c90270	Some of the Levites were secretaries, officers, and gatekeepers.
c90272	While they were bringing out the money
c90273	that had been taken into the house of the LORD,
c90274	Hilkiah the priest found the book of the Law of the LORD [given] by Moses.
c90275	And Hilkiah said to
c90276	Shaphan the scribe, ... to
c90277	“I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD!”
c90278	And he gave [it] ... Shaphan.
c90279	Shaphan took the book to the king
c90280	and reported,
c90282	all
c90283	“Your servants ... that has been placed in their hands.
c90284	are doing
c90285	They have paid out the money
c90286	that was found in the house of the LORD
c90287	and have put it into the hands of the supervisors [and] workers.”
c90288	Moreover , Shaphan the scribe told the king,
c90290	“Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.”
c90291	And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
c90293	When the king heard the words of the Law,
c90294	he tore his clothes
c90295	[and] commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king:
c90297	“Go
c90298	and inquire of the LORD for me,
c90299	and for those remaining in Israel and Judah,
c90300	concerning the words in the book
c90301	that that has been found.
c90302	For great [is] the wrath of the LORD
c90303	that has been poured out on us
c90304	because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD
c90305	by doing all
c90306	that is written in this book.”
c90307	So Hilkiah ... went
c90308	and those the king [had designated]
c90309	to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah,
c90310	the keeper of the wardrobe.
c90311	She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.
c90312	and spoke
c90313	And [Huldah] said to them,
c90314	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c90315	‘Tell the man
c90316	who sent you
c90317	that this is what the LORD says:
c90318	I am about to bring calamity on this place and on its people,
c90319	according to all the curses
c90320	written in the book
c90321	that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah,
c90322	because they have forsaken Me
c90323	and burned incense to other gods,
c90324	that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands.
c90325	My wrath will be poured out upon this place
c90326	and will not be quenched.’
c90327	But as for the king of Judah
c90328	who sent you
c90329	to inquire of the LORD,
c90330	tell him that
c90331	this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
c90332	‘As for the words
c90333	that you heard,
c90334	because your heart was tender
c90335	and you humbled yourself before God
c90336	when you heard His words against this place and against its people,
c90337	and because you have humbled yourself before Me
c90338	and you have torn your clothes
c90339	and wept before Me,
c90340	I have heard [you],’
c90341	declares the LORD.
c90342	‘Now I will indeed gather you to your fathers,
c90343	and you will be gathered to your grave in peace.
c90344	Your eyes will not see all the calamity
c90345	that I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.’”
c90346	So they brought her answer back to the king.
c90347	Then the king summoned
c90348	all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
c90349	And [he] went up to the house of the LORD
c90350	with all and the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the Levites— all the people small and great—
c90351	and in their hearing he read all the words of the Book of the Covenant
c90352	that had been found in the house of the LORD.
c90353	So the king stood by the pillar
c90354	and made a covenant before the LORD
c90355	to follow the LORD
c90356	and to keep His commandments, decrees, and statutes with all his heart and all his soul,
c90357	and to carry out the words of this covenant
c90358	that were written in this book.
c90359	Then he had everyone ... take a stand in agreement to it.
c90360	in Jerusalem and Benjamin
c90361	So all the people of Jerusalem carried out the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
c90362	And Josiah removed all the abominations from all the lands
c90363	belonging to the Israelites,
c90364	and he required everyone ... to serve
c90365	in Israel
c90366	the LORD their God.
c90367	Throughout his reign they did not turn aside from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
c90368	Then Josiah celebrated the Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem,
c90369	and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month.
c90370	He appointed the priests to their duties
c90371	and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD.
c90372	To the Levites ... [Josiah] said:
c90373	who taught all Israel
c90374	and were holy to the LORD,
c90375	“Put the holy ark in the temple
c90376	built by Solomon son of David king of Israel.
c90377	It is not to be carried around on your shoulders.
c90378	Now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel.
c90379	Prepare [yourselves] by your families in your divisions, according to the instructions written by David king of Israel and his son Solomon.
c90380	Moreover, stand in the Holy Place by the divisions of the families of your fellow countrymen, the lay people,
c90381	and [according to] the divisions of the houses of the Levites.
c90382	Slaughter the Passover lambs,
c90383	consecrate yourselves,
c90384	and make preparations for your fellow countrymen
c90385	to carry out the word of the LORD [given] by Moses.”
c90386	flocks [and herds], Josiah contributed ... lambs and goats ... the people
c90387	for the Passover offerings for all
c90388	who were present.
c90389	30,000
c90390	plus 3,000 bulls
c90391	From his own
c90392	His officials also contributed willingly to the people and priests and Levites.
c90393	Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the administrators of the house of God, gave the priests 2,600 Passover [offerings] and 300 bulls.
c90394	Additionally, Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, officers of the Levites, donated to the Levites 5,000 Passover offerings and 500 bulls.
c90395	So the service was prepared;
c90396	the priests stood in their places
c90397	and the Levites in their divisions
c90398	according to the king's command.
c90399	And they slaughtered the Passover lambs,
c90400	while the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them
c90401	and the Levites skinned [the animals].
c90402	They set aside the burnt offerings
c90403	to be given to the divisions of the families of the lay people
c90404	to offer to the LORD,
c90405	as is written in the Book of Moses;
c90406	and they did the same with the bulls.
c90407	They roasted the Passover [animals] on the fire according to regulation,
c90408	and they boiled the [other] holy [offerings] in pots, kettles, and bowls
c90409	and quickly brought them to the lay people.
c90410	Afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests,
c90411	since the priests, the descendants of Aaron,
c90412	[were] offering up burnt offerings and fat until nightfall.
c90413	So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
c90414	The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were at their stations according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer.
c90415	And the gatekeepers at each gate
c90416	did not
c90417	need to leave their position,
c90418	because their fellow Levites made preparations for them.
c90419	So on that day the entire service of the LORD was carried out
c90420	for celebrating the Passover
c90421	and offering burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josiah.
c90422	The Israelites ... also observed
c90423	who were present
c90424	the Passover at that time,
c90425	as well as the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
c90426	No such Passover had been observed in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet.
c90427	None of the kings of Israel ever observed a Passover
c90428	like the one that Josiah observed with the priests, the Levites, all Judah, the Israelites
c90429	who were present,
c90430	and the people of Jerusalem.
c90431	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah, this Passover was observed.
c90432	After all this,
c90433	when Josiah had set the temple {in order},
c90434	Neco king of Egypt marched up
c90435	to fight at Carchemish by the Euphrates,
c90436	went out
c90437	to confront him.
c90438	and Josiah
c90439	But Neco sent messengers to him,
c90440	saying,
c90441	“What is the issue between you and me,
c90442	O king of Judah?
c90443	I have not come against you today,
c90444	but I am fighting another dynasty.
c90445	God told
c90446	me to hurry;
c90447	so stop opposing God,
c90448	who is with me,
c90449	or He will destroy you!”
c90450	Josiah, however, did not turn away from him;
c90451	instead,
c90452	in order to engage him in battle,
c90453	he disguised himself.
c90454	He did not listen to Neco’s words from the mouth of God,
c90455	but went
c90456	to fight him on the Plain of Megiddo.
c90457	There the archers shot King Josiah,
c90458	who said to his servants,
c90459	“Take me away,
c90460	for I am severely wounded!”
c90461	So his servants took him out of his chariot,
c90462	put him in his second chariot,
c90464	and brought him to Jerusalem,
c90465	where he died.
c90466	And [Josiah] was buried in the tomb of his fathers,
c90467	and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for [him].
c90468	Then Jeremiah lamented over Josiah,
c90469	and to this day all the choirs of men and women sing laments over Josiah.
c90470	They established them as a statute for Israel,
c90471	and indeed they are written in the Book of Laments.
c90472	As for the rest of the acts of Josiah, along with his deeds of loving devotion
c90473	according to what is written in the Law of the LORD,
c90474	and his words, from beginning to end,
c90475	they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
c90476	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah
c90477	and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
c90478	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old
c90479	when he became king,
c90480	and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.
c90481	And the king of Egypt dethroned him in Jerusalem
c90482	and imposed on [Judah] {a levy} of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
c90483	Then Neco king of Egypt {made} Eliakim brother of Jehoahaz king over Judah and Jerusalem,
c90484	and he changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim.
c90485	But Neco took Eliakim’s brother Jehoahaz
c90486	and carried him off to Egypt.
c90487	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old
c90488	when he became king,
c90489	and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.
c90490	And he did
c90491	evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
c90492	Then Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jehoiakim
c90493	and bound him in bronze shackles
c90494	to take him to Babylon.
c90495	Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon [some] of the articles from the house of the LORD,
c90496	and he put them in his temple in Babylon.
c90497	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the abominations
c90498	he committed,
c90499	and all that was found against him,
c90500	they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
c90501	And his son Jehoiachin became king in his place.
c90502	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old
c90503	when he became king,
c90504	and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days.
c90505	And he did
c90506	evil in the sight of the LORD.
c90507	In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar summoned [him]
c90508	and brought him to Babylon, along with the articles of value from the house of the LORD,
c90509	and he made Jehoiachin’s relative Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.
c90510	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old
c90511	when he became king,
c90512	and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.
c90513	And he did
c90514	evil in the sight of the LORD his God
c90515	and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke for the LORD.
c90516	He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar,
c90517	who had made him swear by God.
c90518	But [Zedekiah] stiffened his neck
c90519	and hardened his heart
c90520	against turning to the LORD, the God of Israel.
c90521	Furthermore, all the leaders of the priests and the people multiplied
c90522	their unfaithful deeds, [following] all the abominations of the nations,
c90523	and they defiled the house of the LORD,
c90524	which He had consecrated in Jerusalem.
c90525	Time and again the LORD, the God of their fathers, sent word to [His people] through His messengers,
c90526	because He had compassion on [them] and on His dwelling place.
c90527	But they mocked the messengers of God,
c90528	despising His words
c90529	and scoffing at His prophets,
c90530	until the wrath of the LORD against His people was stirred up beyond remedy.
c90531	So He brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans,
c90532	who put their choice young men to the sword in the sanctuary,
c90533	sparing neither young men nor young women, neither elderly nor infirm.
c90534	[God] gave them all into the hand [of Nebuchadnezzar].
c90535	everything ... the articles of the house of God, both large and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king and his officials.
c90536	He carried off ... to Babylon— all
c90537	Then the Chaldeans set fire to the house of God
c90538	and broke down the wall of Jerusalem.
c90539	They burned down all the palaces
c90540	everything of value.
c90541	and destroyed
c90542	Those who escaped the sword were carried by Nebuchadnezzar into exile in Babylon,
c90543	and they became servants to him and his sons
c90544	until the kingdom of Persia came to power.
c90545	in fulfillment of the word of the LORD through Jeremiah.
c90546	So the land enjoyed its Sabbath ... until
c90547	rest all the days of the desolation,
c90548	seventy years were completed,
c90549	In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia,
c90550	to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah,
c90551	the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia
c90552	to send a proclamation throughout his kingdom
c90553	and to put it in writing
c90554	as follows:
c90555	“This is what Cyrus king of Persia says:
c90556	‘The LORD, the God of heaven, ... has given me all the kingdoms of the earth,
c90557	who ... has appointed me
c90558	to build a house for Him at Jerusalem
c90559	in Judah.
c90560	Whoever among you belongs to His people,
c90561	may the LORD his God ... with him.’”
c90562	be
