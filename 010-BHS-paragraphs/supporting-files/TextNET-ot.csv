1	1	1	1	¶In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
2	1	1	2	¶Now the earth was without shape and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the watery deep, but the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the water.
3	1	1	3	God said, “Let there be light.” And there was light!
4	1	1	4	God saw that the light was good, so God separated the light from the darkness.
5	1	1	5	God called the light “day” and the darkness “night.” There was evening, and there was morning, marking the first day.
6	1	1	6	¶God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it separate water from water.”
7	1	1	7	So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. It was so.
8	1	1	8	God called the expanse “sky.” There was evening, and there was morning, a second day.
9	1	1	9	¶God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place and let dry ground appear.” It was so.
10	1	1	10	God called the dry ground “land” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” God saw that it was good.
11	1	1	11	¶God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: plants yielding seeds and trees on the land bearing fruit with seed in it, according to their kinds.” It was so.
12	1	1	12	The land produced vegetation – plants yielding seeds according to their kinds, and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. God saw that it was good.
13	1	1	13	There was evening, and there was morning, a third day.
14	1	1	14	¶God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them be signs to indicate seasons and days and years,
15	1	1	15	and let them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.” It was so.
16	1	1	16	God made two great lights – the greater light to rule over the day and the lesser light to rule over the night. He made the stars also.
17	1	1	17	God placed the lights in the expanse of the sky to shine on the earth,
18	1	1	18	to preside over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.
19	1	1	19	There was evening, and there was morning, a fourth day.
20	1	1	20	¶God said, “Let the water swarm with swarms of living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.”
21	1	1	21	God created the great sea creatures and every living and moving thing with which the water swarmed, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. God saw that it was good.
22	1	1	22	God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.”
23	1	1	23	There was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day.
24	1	1	24	¶God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: cattle, creeping things, and wild animals, each according to its kind.” It was so.
25	1	1	25	God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the cattle according to their kinds, and all the creatures that creep along the ground according to their kinds. God saw that it was good.
26	1	1	26	¶Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, after our likeness, so they may rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move on the earth.”
27	1	1	27	‡God created humankind in his own image, ‡in the image of God he created them, ‡male and female he created them.
28	1	1	28	¶God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply! Fill the earth and subdue it! Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature that moves on the ground.”
29	1	1	29	Then God said, “I now give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the entire earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.
30	1	1	30	And to all the animals of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to all the creatures that move on the ground – everything that has the breath of life in it – I give every green plant for food.” It was so.
31	1	1	31	¶God saw all that he had made – and it was very good! There was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.
32	1	2	1	¶The heavens and the earth were completed with everything that was in them.
33	1	2	2	By the seventh day God finished the work that he had been doing, and he ceased on the seventh day all the work that he had been doing.
34	1	2	3	God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he ceased all the work that he had been doing in creation.
35	1	2	4	¶This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created – when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God made the earth and heavens.
36	1	2	5	¶Now no shrub of the field had yet grown on the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
37	1	2	6	Springs would well up from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground.
38	1	2	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God formed the man from the soil of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
39	1	2	8	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God planted an orchard in the east, in Eden; and there he placed the man he had formed.
40	1	2	9	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God made all kinds of trees grow from the soil, every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food. (Now the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were in the middle of the orchard.)
41	1	2	10	¶Now a river flows from Eden to water the orchard, and from there it divides into four headstreams.
42	1	2	11	The name of the first is Pishon; it runs through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.
43	1	2	12	(The gold of that land is pure; pearls and lapis lazuli are also there).
44	1	2	13	The name of the second river is Gihon; it runs through the entire land of Cush.
45	1	2	14	The name of the third river is Tigris; it runs along the east side of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
46	1	2	15	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God took the man and placed him in the orchard in Eden to care for it and to maintain it.
47	1	2	16	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God commanded the man, “You may freely eat fruit from every tree of the orchard,
48	1	2	17	but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will surely die.”
49	1	2	18	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a companion for him who corresponds to him.”
50	1	2	19	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God formed out of the ground every living animal of the field and every bird of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them, and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
51	1	2	20	So the man named all the animals, the birds of the air, and the living creatures of the field, but for Adam no companion who corresponded to him was found.
52	1	2	21	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was asleep, he took part of the man’s side and closed up the place with flesh.
53	1	2	22	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God made a woman from the part he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.
54	1	2	23	Then the man said, ‡“This one at last is bone of my bones ‡and flesh of my flesh; ‡this one will be called ‘woman,’ ‡for she was taken out of man.”
55	1	2	24	¶That is why a man leaves his father and mother and unites with his wife, and they become a new family.
56	1	2	25	The man and his wife were both naked, but they were not ashamed.
57	1	3	1	¶Now the serpent was more shrewd than any of the wild animals that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God had made. He said to the woman, “Is it really true that God said, ‘You must not eat from any tree of the orchard’?”
58	1	3	2	The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit from the trees of the orchard;
59	1	3	3	but concerning the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the orchard God said, ‘You must not eat from it, and you must not touch it, or else you will die.’”
60	1	3	4	The serpent said to the woman, “Surely you will not die,
61	1	3	5	for God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will open and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
62	1	3	6	¶When the woman saw that the tree produced fruit that was good for food, was attractive to the eye, and was desirable for making one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate it. She also gave some of it to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.
63	1	3	7	Then the eyes of both of them opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
64	1	3	8	¶Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God moving about in the orchard at the breezy time of the day, and they hid from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God among the trees of the orchard.
65	1	3	9	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”
66	1	3	10	The man replied, “I heard you moving about in the orchard, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”
67	1	3	11	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
68	1	3	12	The man said, “The woman whom you gave me, she gave me some fruit from the tree and I ate it.”
69	1	3	13	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” And the woman replied, “The serpent tricked me, and I ate.”
70	1	3	14	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God said to the serpent, ‡“Because you have done this, ‡cursed are you above all the cattle ‡and all the living creatures of the field! ‡On your belly you will crawl ‡and dust you will eat all the days of your life.
71	1	3	15	‡And I will put hostility between you and the woman ‡and between your offspring and her offspring; ‡her offspring will attack your head,‡and you will attack her offspring’s heel.”
72	1	3	16	‡To the woman he said,‡“I will greatly increase your labor pains; ‡with pain you will give birth to children.‡You will want to control your husband, ‡but he will dominate you.”
73	1	3	17	‡But to Adam he said, ‡“Because you obeyed your wife ‡and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, ‡‘You must not eat from it,’ ‡the ground is cursed because of you; ‡in painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
74	1	3	18	‡It will produce thorns and thistles for you, ‡but you will eat the grain of the field.
75	1	3	19	‡By the sweat of your brow you will eat food ‡until you return to the ground, ‡for out of it you were taken; ‡for you are dust, and to dust you will return.”
76	1	3	20	¶The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all the living.
77	1	3	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God made garments from skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.
78	1	3	22	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God said, “Now that the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil, he must not be allowed to stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.”
79	1	3	23	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God expelled him from the orchard in Eden to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken.
80	1	3	24	When he drove the man out, he placed on the eastern side of the orchard in Eden angelic sentries who used the flame of a whirling sword to guard the way to the tree of life.
81	1	4	1	¶Now the man was intimate with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. Then she said, “I have created a man just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did!”
82	1	4	2	Then she gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel took care of the flocks, while Cain cultivated the ground.
83	1	4	3	¶At the designated time Cain brought some of the fruit of the ground for an offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
84	1	4	4	But Abel brought some of the firstborn of his flock – even the fattest of them. And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was pleased with Abel and his offering,
85	1	4	5	but with Cain and his offering he was not pleased. So Cain became very angry, and his expression was downcast.
86	1	4	6	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why is your expression downcast?
87	1	4	7	Is it not true that if you do what is right, you will be fine? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. It desires to dominate you, but you must subdue it.”
88	1	4	8	¶Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.” While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
89	1	4	9	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” And he replied, “I don’t know! Am I my brother’s guardian?”
90	1	4	10	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground!
91	1	4	11	So now, you are banished from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
92	1	4	12	When you try to cultivate the ¶ground it will no longer yield its best for you. You will be a homeless wanderer on the earth.”
93	1	4	13	Then Cain said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “My punishment is too great to endure!
94	1	4	14	Look! You are driving me off the land today, and I must hide from your presence. I will be a homeless wanderer on the earth; whoever finds me will kill me.”
95	1	4	15	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “All right then, if anyone kills Cain, Cain will be avenged seven times as much.” Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> put a special mark on Cain so that no one who found him would strike him down.
96	1	4	16	So Cain went out from the presence of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
97	1	4	17	¶Cain was intimate with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was building a city, and he named the city after his son Enoch.
98	1	4	18	To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael. Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.
99	1	4	19	¶Lamech took two wives for himself; the name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah.
100	1	4	20	Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the first of those who live in tents and keep livestock.
101	1	4	21	The name of his brother was Jubal; he was the first of all who play the harp and the flute.
102	1	4	22	Now Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain, who heated metal and shaped all kinds of tools made of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.
103	1	4	23	¶Lamech said to his wives, ‡“Adah and Zillah! Listen to me! ‡You wives of Lamech, hear my words! ‡I have killed a man for wounding me, ‡a young man for hurting me.
104	1	4	24	‡If Cain is to be avenged seven times as much, ‡then Lamech seventy-seven times!”
105	1	4	25	¶And Adam was intimate with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son. She named him Seth, saying, “God has given me another child in place of Abel because Cain killed him.”
106	1	4	26	And a son was also born to Seth, whom he named Enosh. At that time people began to worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
107	1	5	1	¶This is the record of the family line of Adam.¶When God created humankind, he made them in the likeness of God.
108	1	5	2	He created them male and female; when they were created, he blessed them and named them “humankind.”
109	1	5	3	¶When Adam had lived 130 years he fathered a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and he named him Seth.
110	1	5	4	The length of time Adam lived after he became the father of Seth was 800 years; during this time he had other sons and daughters.
111	1	5	5	The entire lifetime of Adam was 930 years, and then he died.
112	1	5	6	¶When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father of Enosh.
113	1	5	7	Seth lived 807 years after he became the father of Enosh, and he had other sons and daughters.
114	1	5	8	The entire lifetime of Seth was 912 years, and then he died.
115	1	5	9	¶When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan.
116	1	5	10	Enosh lived 815 years after he became the father of Kenan, and he had other sons and daughters.
117	1	5	11	The entire lifetime of Enosh was 905 years, and then he died.
118	1	5	12	¶When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel.
119	1	5	13	Kenan lived 840 years after he became the father of Mahalalel, and he had other sons and daughters.
120	1	5	14	The entire lifetime of Kenan was 910 years, and then he died.
121	1	5	15	¶When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared.
122	1	5	16	Mahalalel lived 830 years after he became the father of Jared, and he had other sons and daughters.
123	1	5	17	The entire lifetime of Mahalalel was 895 years, and then he died.
124	1	5	18	¶When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch.
125	1	5	19	Jared lived 800 years after he became the father of Enoch, and he had other sons and daughters.
126	1	5	20	The entire lifetime of Jared was 962 years, and then he died.
127	1	5	21	¶When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah.
128	1	5	22	After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God for 300 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
129	1	5	23	The entire lifetime of Enoch was 365 years.
130	1	5	24	Enoch walked with God, and then he disappeared because God took him away.
131	1	5	25	¶When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech.
132	1	5	26	Methuselah lived 782 years after he became the father of Lamech, and he had other sons and daughters.
133	1	5	27	The entire lifetime of Methuselah was 969 years, and then he died.
134	1	5	28	¶When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son.
135	1	5	29	He named him Noah, saying, “This one will bring us comfort from our labor and from the painful toil of our hands because of the ground that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has cursed.”
136	1	5	30	Lamech lived 595 years after he became the father of Noah, and he had other sons and daughters.
137	1	5	31	The entire lifetime of Lamech was 777 years, and then he died.
138	1	5	32	¶After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
139	1	6	1	¶When humankind began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,
140	1	6	2	the sons of God saw that the daughters of humankind were beautiful. Thus they took wives for themselves from any they chose.
141	1	6	3	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “My Spirit will not remain in humankind indefinitely, since they are mortal. They will remain for 120 more years.”
142	1	6	4	¶The Nephilim were on the earth in those days (and also after this) when the sons of God would sleep with the daughters of humankind, who gave birth to their children. They were the mighty heroes of old, the famous men.
143	1	6	5	¶But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> saw that the wickedness of humankind had become great on the earth. Every inclination of the thoughts of their minds was only evil all the time.
144	1	6	6	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> regretted that he had made humankind on the earth, and he was highly offended.
145	1	6	7	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “I will wipe humankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth – everything from humankind to animals, including creatures that move on the ground and birds of the air, for I regret that I have made them.”
146	1	6	8	¶But Noah found favor in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
147	1	6	9	¶This is the account of Noah. ¶Noah was a godly man; he was blameless among his contemporaries. He walked with God.
148	1	6	10	Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
149	1	6	11	¶The earth was ruined in the sight of God; the earth was filled with violence.
150	1	6	12	God saw the earth, and indeed it was ruined, for all living creatures on the earth were sinful.
151	1	6	13	So God said to Noah, “I have decided that all living creatures must die, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. Now I am about to destroy them and the earth.
152	1	6	14	Make for yourself an ark of cypress wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it with pitch inside and out.
153	1	6	15	This is how you should make it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
154	1	6	16	Make a roof for the ark and finish it, leaving 18 inches from the top. Put a door in the side of the ark, and make lower, middle, and upper decks.
155	1	6	17	I am about to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy from under the sky all the living creatures that have the breath of life in them. Everything that is on the earth will die,
156	1	6	18	but I will confirm my covenant with you. You will enter the ark – you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.
157	1	6	19	You must bring into the ark two of every kind of living creature from all flesh, male and female, to keep them alive with you.
158	1	6	20	Of the birds after their kinds, and of the cattle after their kinds, and of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every kind will come to you so you can keep them alive.
159	1	6	21	And you must take for yourself every kind of food that is eaten, and gather it together. It will be food for you and for them.”
160	1	6	22	¶And Noah did all that God commanded him – he did indeed.
161	1	7	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Noah, “Come into the ark, you and all your household, for I consider you godly among this generation.
162	1	7	2	You must take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, the male and its mate, two of every kind of unclean animal, the male and its mate,
163	1	7	3	and also seven pairs of every kind of bird in the sky, male and female, to preserve their offspring on the face of the entire earth.
164	1	7	4	For in seven days I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the ground every living thing that I have made.”
165	1	7	5	¶And Noah did all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded him.
166	1	7	6	¶Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters engulfed the earth.
167	1	7	7	Noah entered the ark along with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives because of the floodwaters.
168	1	7	8	Pairs of clean animals, of unclean animals, of birds, and of everything that creeps along the ground,
169	1	7	9	male and female, came into the ark to Noah, just as God had commanded him.
170	1	7	10	And after seven days the floodwaters engulfed the earth.
171	1	7	11	¶In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month – on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
172	1	7	12	And the rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
173	1	7	13	¶On that very day Noah entered the ark, accompanied by his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, along with his wife and his sons’ three wives.
174	1	7	14	They entered, along with every living creature after its kind, every animal after its kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, everything with wings.
175	1	7	15	Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life came into the ark to Noah.
176	1	7	16	Those that entered were male and female, just as God commanded him. Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> shut him in.
177	1	7	17	¶The flood engulfed the earth for forty days. As the waters increased, they lifted the ark and raised it above the earth.
178	1	7	18	The waters completely overwhelmed the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the waters.
179	1	7	19	The waters completely inundated the earth so that even all the high mountains under the entire sky were covered.
180	1	7	20	The waters rose more than twenty feet above the mountains.
181	1	7	21	And all living things that moved on the earth died, including the birds, domestic animals, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all humankind.
182	1	7	22	Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
183	1	7	23	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> destroyed every living thing that was on the surface of the ground, including people, animals, creatures that creep along the ground, and birds of the sky. They were wiped off the earth. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark survived.
184	1	7	24	The waters prevailed over the earth for 150 days.
185	1	8	1	¶But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and domestic animals that were with him in the ark. God caused a wind to blow over the earth and the waters receded.
186	1	8	2	The fountains of the deep and the floodgates of heaven were closed, and the rain stopped falling from the sky.
187	1	8	3	The waters kept receding steadily from the earth, so that they had gone down by the end of the 150 days.
188	1	8	4	On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on one of the mountains of Ararat.
189	1	8	5	The waters kept on receding until the tenth month. On the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains became visible.
190	1	8	6	¶At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window he had made in the ark
191	1	8	7	and sent out a raven; it kept flying back and forth until the waters had dried up on the earth.
192	1	8	8	¶Then Noah sent out a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.
193	1	8	9	The dove could not find a resting place for its feet because water still covered the surface of the entire earth, and so it returned to Noah in the ark. He stretched out his hand, took the dove, and brought it back into the ark.
194	1	8	10	He waited seven more days and then sent out the dove again from the ark.
195	1	8	11	When the dove returned to him in the evening, there was a freshly plucked olive leaf in its beak! Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth.
196	1	8	12	He waited another seven days and sent the dove out again, but it did not return to him this time.
197	1	8	13	¶In Noah’s six hundred and first year, in the first day of the first month, the waters had dried up from the earth, and Noah removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
198	1	8	14	And by the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was dry.
199	1	8	15	¶Then God spoke to Noah and said,
200	1	8	16	“Come out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you.
201	1	8	17	Bring out with you all the living creatures that are with you. Bring out every living thing, including the birds, animals, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. Let them increase and be fruitful and multiply on the earth!”
202	1	8	18	¶Noah went out along with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives.
203	1	8	19	Every living creature, every creeping thing, every bird, and everything that moves on the earth went out of the ark in their groups.
204	1	8	20	¶Noah built an altar to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He then took some of every kind of clean animal and clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
205	1	8	21	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> smelled the soothing aroma and said to himself, “I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, even though the inclination of their minds is evil from childhood on. I will never again destroy everything that lives, as I have just done.
206	1	8	22	‡“While the earth continues to exist, ‡planting time and harvest, ‡cold and heat, ‡summer and winter, ‡and day and night will not cease.”
207	1	9	1	¶Then God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
208	1	9	2	Every living creature of the earth and every bird of the sky will be terrified of you. Everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea are under your authority.
209	1	9	3	You may eat any moving thing that lives. As I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.
210	1	9	4	¶But you must not eat meat with its life (that is, its blood) in it.
211	1	9	5	For your lifeblood I will surely exact punishment, from every living creature I will exact punishment. From each person I will exact punishment for the life of the individual since the man was his relative.
212	1	9	6	‡“Whoever sheds human blood, ‡by other humans ‡must his blood be shed; ‡for in God’s image ‡God has made humankind.”
213	1	9	7	¶But as for you, be fruitful and multiply; increase abundantly on the earth and multiply on it.”
214	1	9	8	¶God said to Noah and his sons,
215	1	9	9	“Look! I now confirm my covenant with you and your descendants after you
216	1	9	10	and with every living creature that is with you, including the birds, the domestic animals, and every living creature of the earth with you, all those that came out of the ark with you – every living creature of the earth.
217	1	9	11	I confirm my covenant with you: Never again will all living things be wiped out by the waters of a flood; never again will a flood destroy the earth.”
218	1	9	12	¶And God said, “This is the guarantee of the covenant I am making with you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all subsequent generations:
219	1	9	13	I will place my rainbow in the clouds, and it will become a guarantee of the covenant between me and the earth.
220	1	9	14	Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
221	1	9	15	then I will remember my covenant with you and with all living creatures of all kinds. Never again will the waters become a flood and destroy all living things.
222	1	9	16	When the rainbow is in the clouds, I will notice it and remember the perpetual covenant between God and all living creatures of all kinds that are on the earth.”
223	1	9	17	¶So God said to Noah, “This is the guarantee of the covenant that I am confirming between me and all living things that are on the earth.”
224	1	9	18	¶The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Now Ham was the father of Canaan.)
225	1	9	19	These were the three sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was populated.
226	1	9	20	¶Noah, a man of the soil, began to plant a vineyard.
227	1	9	21	When he drank some of the wine, he got drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent.
228	1	9	22	Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers who were outside.
229	1	9	23	Shem and Japheth took the garment and placed it on their shoulders. Then they walked in backwards and covered up their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so they did not see their father’s nakedness.
230	1	9	24	¶When Noah awoke from his drunken stupor he learned what his youngest son had done to him.
231	1	9	25	So he said,‡“Cursed be Canaan! ‡The lowest of slaves ‡he will be to his brothers.”
232	1	9	26	¶He also said,‡“Worthy of praise is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of Shem! ‡May Canaan be the slave of Shem!
233	1	9	27	‡May God enlarge Japheth’s territory and numbers! ‡May he live in the tents of Shem ‡and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth!”
234	1	9	28	¶After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
235	1	9	29	The entire lifetime of Noah was 950 years, and then he died.
236	1	10	1	¶This is the account of Noah’s sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
237	1	10	2	¶The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
238	1	10	3	The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
239	1	10	4	The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittim, and the Dodanim.
240	1	10	5	From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to its language, according to their families, by their nations.
241	1	10	6	¶The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
242	1	10	7	The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.
243	1	10	8	¶Cush was the father of Nimrod; he began to be a valiant warrior on the earth.
244	1	10	9	He was a mighty hunter before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. (That is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
245	1	10	10	The primary regions of his kingdom were Babel, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh in the land of Shinar.
246	1	10	11	From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,
247	1	10	12	and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city Calah.
248	1	10	13	¶Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,
249	1	10	14	Pathrusites, Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorites.
250	1	10	15	¶Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, Heth,
251	1	10	16	the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,
252	1	10	17	Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
253	1	10	18	Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. Eventually the families of the Canaanites were scattered
254	1	10	19	and the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon all the way to Gerar as far as Gaza, and all the way to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
255	1	10	20	These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, and by their nations.
256	1	10	21	¶And sons were also born to Shem (the older brother of Japheth), the father of all the sons of Eber.
257	1	10	22	¶The sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
258	1	10	23	The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
259	1	10	24	Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah was the father of Eber.
260	1	10	25	Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother’s name was Joktan.
261	1	10	26	Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
262	1	10	27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
263	1	10	28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
264	1	10	29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.
265	1	10	30	Their dwelling place was from Mesha all the way to Sephar in the eastern hills.
266	1	10	31	These are the sons of Shem according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, and according to their nations.
267	1	10	32	¶These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, by their nations, and from these the nations spread over the earth after the flood.
268	1	11	1	¶The whole earth had a common language and a common vocabulary.
269	1	11	2	When the people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
270	1	11	3	Then they said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” (They had brick instead of stone and tar instead of mortar.)
271	1	11	4	Then they said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens so that we may make a name for ourselves. Otherwise we will be scattered across the face of the entire earth.”
272	1	11	5	¶But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came down to see the city and the tower that the people had started building.
273	1	11	6	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “If as one people all sharing a common language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be beyond them.
274	1	11	7	Come, let’s go down and confuse their language so they won’t be able to understand each other.”
275	1	11	8	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> scattered them from there across the face of the entire earth, and they stopped building the city.
276	1	11	9	That is why its name was called Babel – because there the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> confused the language of the entire world, and from there the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> scattered them across the face of the entire earth.
277	1	11	10	¶This is the account of Shem.¶Shem was 100 years old when he became the father of Arphaxad, two years after the flood.
278	1	11	11	And after becoming the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
279	1	11	12	¶When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah.
280	1	11	13	And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
281	1	11	14	¶When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber.
282	1	11	15	And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
283	1	11	16	¶When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg.
284	1	11	17	And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
285	1	11	18	¶When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu.
286	1	11	19	And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
287	1	11	20	¶When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug.
288	1	11	21	And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
289	1	11	22	¶When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor.
290	1	11	23	And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
291	1	11	24	¶When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah.
292	1	11	25	And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
293	1	11	26	¶When Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
294	1	11	27	¶This is the account of Terah.¶Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.
295	1	11	28	Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans, while his father Terah was still alive.
296	1	11	29	And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai. And the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah; she was the daughter of Haran, who was the father of both Milcah and Iscah.
297	1	11	30	But Sarai was barren; she had no children.
298	1	11	31	¶Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (the son of Haran), and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and with them he set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. When they came to Haran, they settled there.
299	1	11	32	The lifetime of Terah was 205 years, and he died in Haran.
300	1	12	1	‡Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Abram, ‡“Go out from your country, your relatives, and your father’s household‡to the land that I will show you.
301	1	12	2	‡Then I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you, ‡and I will make your name great, ‡so that you will exemplify divine blessing.
302	1	12	3	‡I will bless those who bless you, ‡but the one who treats you lightly I must curse, ‡so that all the families of the earth may receive blessing through you.”
303	1	12	4	¶So Abram left, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had told him to do, and Lot went with him. (Now Abram was 75 years old when he departed from Haran.)
304	1	12	5	And Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they left for the land of Canaan. They entered the land of Canaan.
305	1	12	6	¶Abram traveled through the land as far as the oak tree of Moreh at Shechem. (At that time the Canaanites were in the land.)
306	1	12	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” So Abram built an altar there to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> who had appeared to him.
307	1	12	8	¶Then he moved from there to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
308	1	12	9	Abram continually journeyed by stages down to the Negev.
309	1	12	10	¶There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to stay for a while because the famine was severe.
310	1	12	11	As he approached Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “Look, I know that you are a beautiful woman.
311	1	12	12	When the Egyptians see you they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will keep you alive.
312	1	12	13	So tell them you are my sister so that it may go well for me because of you and my life will be spared on account of you.”
313	1	12	14	¶When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
314	1	12	15	When Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. So Abram’s wife was taken into the household of Pharaoh,
315	1	12	16	and he did treat Abram well on account of her. Abram received sheep and cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
316	1	12	17	¶But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> struck Pharaoh and his household with severe diseases because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.
317	1	12	18	So Pharaoh summoned Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife?
318	1	12	19	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now, here is your wife. Take her and go!”
319	1	12	20	Pharaoh gave his men orders about Abram, and so they expelled him, along with his wife and all his possessions.
320	1	13	1	¶So Abram went up from Egypt into the Negev. He took his wife and all his possessions with him, as well as Lot.
321	1	13	2	(Now Abram was very wealthy in livestock, silver, and gold.)
322	1	13	3	¶And he journeyed from place to place from the Negev as far as Bethel. He returned to the place where he had pitched his tent at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai.
323	1	13	4	This was the place where he had first built the altar, and there Abram worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
324	1	13	5	¶Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents.
325	1	13	6	But the land could not support them while they were living side by side. Because their possessions were so great, they were not able to live alongside one another.
326	1	13	7	So there were quarrels between Abram’s herdsmen and Lot’s herdsmen. (Now the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land at that time.)
327	1	13	8	¶Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no quarreling between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are close relatives.
328	1	13	9	Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself now from me. If you go to the left, then I’ll go to the right, but if you go to the right, then I’ll go to the left.”
329	1	13	10	¶Lot looked up and saw the whole region of the Jordan. He noticed that all of it was well-watered (before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> obliterated Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, like the land of Egypt, all the way to Zoar.
330	1	13	11	Lot chose for himself the whole region of the Jordan and traveled toward the east. ¶So the relatives separated from each other.
331	1	13	12	Abram settled in the land of Canaan, but Lot settled among the cities of the Jordan plain and pitched his tents next to Sodom.
332	1	13	13	(Now the people of Sodom were extremely wicked rebels against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.)
333	1	13	14	¶After Lot had departed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Abram, “Look from the place where you stand to the north, south, east, and west.
334	1	13	15	I will give all the land that you see to you and your descendants forever.
335	1	13	16	And I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone is able to count the dust of the earth, then your descendants also can be counted.
336	1	13	17	Get up and walk throughout the land, for I will give it to you.”
337	1	13	18	¶So Abram moved his tents and went to live by the oaks of Mamre in Hebron, and he built an altar to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> there.
338	1	14	1	¶At that time Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations
339	1	14	2	went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
340	1	14	3	These last five kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).
341	1	14	4	For twelve years they had served Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
342	1	14	5	In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings who were his allies came and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
343	1	14	6	and the Horites in their hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran, which is near the desert.
344	1	14	7	Then they attacked En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh) again, and they conquered all the territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazazon Tamar.
345	1	14	8	¶Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out and prepared for battle. In the Valley of Siddim they met
346	1	14	9	Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of nations, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar. Four kings fought against five.
347	1	14	10	Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits. When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them, but some survivors fled to the hills.
348	1	14	11	The four victorious kings took all the possessions and food of Sodom and Gomorrah and left.
349	1	14	12	They also took Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions when they left, for Lot was living in Sodom.
350	1	14	13	¶A fugitive came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol and Aner. (All these were allied by treaty with Abram.)
351	1	14	14	When Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive, he mobilized his 318 trained men who had been born in his household, and he pursued the invaders as far as Dan.
352	1	14	15	Then, during the night, Abram divided his forces against them and defeated them. He chased them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus.
353	1	14	16	He retrieved all the stolen property. He also brought back his nephew Lot and his possessions, as well as the women and the rest of the people.
354	1	14	17	¶After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet Abram in the Valley of Shaveh (known as the King’s Valley).
355	1	14	18	Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (Now he was the priest of the Most High God.)
356	1	14	19	He blessed Abram, saying, ‡“Blessed be Abram by the Most High God, ‡Creator of heaven and earth.
357	1	14	20	‡Worthy of praise is the Most High God, ‡who delivered your enemies into your hand.” ¶Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything.
358	1	14	21	¶Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and take the possessions for yourself.”
359	1	14	22	But Abram replied to the king of Sodom, “I raise my hand to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the Most High God, Creator of heaven and earth, and vow
360	1	14	23	that I will take nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal. That way you can never say, ‘It is I who made Abram rich.’
361	1	14	24	I will take nothing except compensation for what the young men have eaten. As for the share of the men who went with me – Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre – let them take their share.”
362	1	15	1	¶After these things the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message came to Abram in a vision: “Fear not, Abram! I am your shield and the one who will reward you in great abundance.”
363	1	15	2	¶But Abram said, “O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, what will you give me since I continue to be childless, and my heir is Eliezer of Damascus?”
364	1	15	3	Abram added, “Since you have not given me a descendant, then look, one born in my house will be my heir!”
365	1	15	4	¶But look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but instead a son who comes from your own body will be your heir.”
366	1	15	5	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> took him outside and said, “Gaze into the sky and count the stars – if you are able to count them!” Then he said to him, “So will your descendants be.”
367	1	15	6	¶Abram believed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> credited it as righteousness to him.
368	1	15	7	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”
369	1	15	8	But Abram said, “O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, by what can I know that I am to possess it?”
370	1	15	9	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Take for me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.”
371	1	15	10	So Abram took all these for him and then cut them in two and placed each half opposite the other, but he did not cut the birds in half.
372	1	15	11	When birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
373	1	15	12	¶When the sun went down, Abram fell sound asleep, and great terror overwhelmed him.
374	1	15	13	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a foreign country. They will be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years.
375	1	15	14	But I will execute judgment on the nation that they will serve. Afterward they will come out with many possessions.
376	1	15	15	But as for you, you will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.
377	1	15	16	In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its limit.”
378	1	15	17	¶When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking firepot with a flaming torch passed between the animal parts.
379	1	15	18	That day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made a covenant with Abram: “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates River –
380	1	15	19	the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
381	1	15	20	Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,
382	1	15	21	Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
383	1	16	1	¶Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had not given birth to any children, but she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar.
384	1	16	2	So Sarai said to Abram, “Since the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has prevented me from having children, please sleep with my servant. Perhaps I can have a family by her.” Abram did what Sarai told him.
385	1	16	3	¶So after Abram had lived in Canaan for ten years, Sarai, Abram’s wife, gave Hagar, her Egyptian servant, to her husband to be his wife.
386	1	16	4	He slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. Once Hagar realized she was pregnant, she despised Sarai.
387	1	16	5	Then Sarai said to Abram, “You have brought this wrong on me! I gave my servant into your embrace, but when she realized that she was pregnant, she despised me. May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> judge between you and me!”
388	1	16	6	¶Abram said to Sarai, “Since your servant is under your authority, do to her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai treated Hagar harshly, so she ran away from Sarai.
389	1	16	7	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel found Hagar near a spring of water in the wilderness – the spring that is along the road to Shur.
390	1	16	8	He said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” She replied, “I’m running away from my mistress, Sarai.”
391	1	16	9	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.
392	1	16	10	I will greatly multiply your descendants,” the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel added, “so that they will be too numerous to count.”
393	1	16	11	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel said to her,‡“You are now pregnant‡and are about to give birth to a son.‡You are to name him Ishmael, ‡for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has heard your painful groans.
394	1	16	12	‡He will be a wild donkey of a man.‡He will be hostile to everyone, ‡and everyone will be hostile to him. ‡He will live away from his brothers.”
395	1	16	13	¶So Hagar named the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who spoke to her, “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “Here I have seen one who sees me!”
396	1	16	14	That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. (It is located between Kadesh and Bered.)
397	1	16	15	¶So Hagar gave birth to Abram’s son, whom Abram named Ishmael.
398	1	16	16	(Now Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.)
399	1	17	1	¶When Abram was 99 years old, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to him and said, “I am the Sovereign God. Walk before me and be blameless.
400	1	17	2	Then I will confirm my covenant between me and you, and I will give you a multitude of descendants.”
401	1	17	3	¶Abram bowed down with his face to the ground, and God said to him,
402	1	17	4	“As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of a multitude of nations.
403	1	17	5	No longer will your name be Abram. Instead, your name will be Abraham because I will make you the father of a multitude of nations.
404	1	17	6	I will make you extremely fruitful. I will make nations of you, and kings will descend from you.
405	1	17	7	I will confirm my covenant as a perpetual covenant between me and you. It will extend to your descendants after you throughout their generations. I will be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
406	1	17	8	I will give the whole land of Canaan – the land where you are now residing – to you and your descendants after you as a permanent possession. I will be their God.”
407	1	17	9	¶Then God said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep the covenantal requirement I am imposing on you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.
408	1	17	10	This is my requirement that you and your descendants after you must keep: Every male among you must be circumcised.
409	1	17	11	You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskins. This will be a reminder of the covenant between me and you.
410	1	17	12	Throughout your generations every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, whether born in your house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not one of your descendants.
411	1	17	13	They must indeed be circumcised, whether born in your house or bought with money. The sign of my covenant will be visible in your flesh as a permanent reminder.
412	1	17	14	Any uncircumcised male who has not been circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin will be cut off from his people – he has failed to carry out my requirement.”
413	1	17	15	¶Then God said to Abraham, “As for your wife, you must no longer call her Sarai; Sarah will be her name.
414	1	17	16	I will bless her and will give you a son through her. I will bless her and she will become a mother of nations. Kings of countries will come from her!”
415	1	17	17	¶Then Abraham bowed down with his face to the ground and laughed as he said to himself, “Can a son be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?”
416	1	17	18	Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live before you!”
417	1	17	19	¶God said, “No, Sarah your wife is going to bear you a son, and you will name him Isaac. I will confirm my covenant with him as a perpetual covenant for his descendants after him.
418	1	17	20	As for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will indeed bless him, make him fruitful, and give him a multitude of descendants. He will become the father of twelve princes; I will make him into a great nation.
419	1	17	21	But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.”
420	1	17	22	When he finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
421	1	17	23	¶Abraham took his son Ishmael and every male in his household (whether born in his house or bought with money) and circumcised them on that very same day, just as God had told him to do.
422	1	17	24	Now Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised;
423	1	17	25	his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised.
424	1	17	26	Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised on the very same day.
425	1	17	27	All the men of his household, whether born in his household or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
426	1	18	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent during the hottest time of the day.
427	1	18	2	Abraham looked up and saw three men standing across from him. When he saw them he ran from the entrance of the tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.
428	1	18	3	¶He said, “My lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by and leave your servant.
429	1	18	4	Let a little water be brought so that you may all wash your feet and rest under the tree.
430	1	18	5	And let me get a bit of food so that you may refresh yourselves since you have passed by your servant’s home. After that you may be on your way.” “All right,” they replied, “you may do as you say.”
431	1	18	6	¶So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick! Take three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make bread.”
432	1	18	7	Then Abraham ran to the herd and chose a fine, tender calf, and gave it to a servant, who quickly prepared it.
433	1	18	8	Abraham then took some curds and milk, along with the calf that had been prepared, and placed the food before them. They ate while he was standing near them under a tree.
434	1	18	9	¶Then they asked him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” He replied, “There, in the tent.”
435	1	18	10	One of them said, “I will surely return to you when the season comes round again, and your wife Sarah will have a son!” (Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, not far behind him.
436	1	18	11	Abraham and Sarah were old and advancing in years; Sarah had long since passed menopause.)
437	1	18	12	So Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, “After I am worn out will I have pleasure, especially when my husband is old too?”
438	1	18	13	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child when I am old?’
439	1	18	14	Is anything impossible for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>? I will return to you when the season comes round again and Sarah will have a son.”
440	1	18	15	Then Sarah lied, saying, “I did not laugh,” because she was afraid. But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “No! You did laugh.”
441	1	18	16	¶When the men got up to leave, they looked out over Sodom. (Now Abraham was walking with them to see them on their way.)
442	1	18	17	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?
443	1	18	18	After all, Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all the nations on the earth may receive blessing through him.
444	1	18	19	I have chosen him so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by doing what is right and just. Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will give to Abraham what he promised him.”
445	1	18	20	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so blatant
446	1	18	21	that I must go down and see if they are as wicked as the outcry suggests. If not, I want to know.”
447	1	18	22	¶The two men turned and headed toward Sodom, but Abraham was still standing before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
448	1	18	23	Abraham approached and said, “Will you really sweep away the godly along with the wicked?
449	1	18	24	What if there are fifty godly people in the city? Will you really wipe it out and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty godly people who are in it?
450	1	18	25	Far be it from you to do such a thing – to kill the godly with the wicked, treating the godly and the wicked alike! Far be it from you! Will not the judge of the whole earth do what is right?”
451	1	18	26	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> replied, “If I find in the city of Sodom fifty godly people, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”
452	1	18	27	¶Then Abraham asked, “Since I have undertaken to speak to the Lord (although I am but dust and ashes),
453	1	18	28	what if there are five less than the fifty godly people? Will you destroy the whole city because five are lacking?” He replied, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”
454	1	18	29	¶Abraham spoke to him again, “What if forty are found there?” He replied, “I will not do it for the sake of the forty.”
455	1	18	30	¶Then Abraham said, “May the Lord not be angry so that I may speak! What if thirty are found there?” He replied, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”
456	1	18	31	¶Abraham said, “Since I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty are found there?” He replied, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.”
457	1	18	32	¶Finally Abraham said, “May the Lord not be angry so that I may speak just once more. What if ten are found there?” He replied, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.”
458	1	18	33	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> went on his way when he had finished speaking to Abraham. Then Abraham returned home.
459	1	19	1	¶The two angels came to Sodom in the evening while Lot was sitting in the city’s gateway. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face toward the ground.
460	1	19	2	¶He said, “Here, my lords, please turn aside to your servant’s house. Stay the night and wash your feet. Then you can be on your way early in the morning.” “No,” they replied, “we’ll spend the night in the town square.”
461	1	19	3	¶But he urged them persistently, so they turned aside with him and entered his house. He prepared a feast for them, including bread baked without yeast, and they ate.
462	1	19	4	Before they could lie down to sleep, all the men – both young and old, from every part of the city of Sodom – surrounded the house.
463	1	19	5	They shouted to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can take carnal knowledge of them!”
464	1	19	6	¶Lot went outside to them, shutting the door behind him.
465	1	19	7	He said, “No, my brothers! Don’t act so wickedly!
466	1	19	8	Look, I have two daughters who have never been intimate with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do to them whatever you please. Only don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”
467	1	19	9	¶“Out of our way!” they cried, and “This man came to live here as a foreigner, and now he dares to judge us! We’ll do more harm to you than to them!” They kept pressing in on Lot until they were close enough to break down the door.
468	1	19	10	¶So the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house as they shut the door.
469	1	19	11	Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, from the youngest to the oldest, with blindness. The men outside wore themselves out trying to find the door.
470	1	19	12	Then the two visitors said to Lot, “Who else do you have here? Do you have any sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or other relatives in the city? Get them out of this place
471	1	19	13	because we are about to destroy it. The outcry against this place is so great before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that he has sent us to destroy it.”
472	1	19	14	¶Then Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law who were going to marry his daughters. He said, “Quick, get out of this place because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was ridiculing them.
473	1	19	15	¶At dawn the angels hurried Lot along, saying, “Get going! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or else you will be destroyed when the city is judged!”
474	1	19	16	When Lot hesitated, the men grabbed his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had compassion on them. They led them away and placed them outside the city.
475	1	19	17	When they had brought them outside, they said, “Run for your lives! Don’t look behind you or stop anywhere in the valley! Escape to the mountains or you will be destroyed!”
476	1	19	18	¶But Lot said to them, “No, please, Lord!
477	1	19	19	Your servant has found favor with you, and you have shown me great kindness by sparing my life. But I am not able to escape to the mountains because this disaster will overtake me and I’ll die.
478	1	19	20	Look, this town over here is close enough to escape to, and it’s just a little one. Let me go there. It’s just a little place, isn’t it? Then I’ll survive.”
479	1	19	21	¶“Very well,” he replied, “I will grant this request too and will not overthrow the town you mentioned.
480	1	19	22	Run there quickly, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” (This incident explains why the town was called Zoar.)
481	1	19	23	¶The sun had just risen over the land as Lot reached Zoar.
482	1	19	24	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rained down sulfur and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah. It was sent down from the sky by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
483	1	19	25	So he overthrew those cities and all that region, including all the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation that grew from the ground.
484	1	19	26	But Lot’s wife looked back longingly and was turned into a pillar of salt.
485	1	19	27	¶Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
486	1	19	28	He looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of that region. As he did so, he saw the smoke rising up from the land like smoke from a furnace.
487	1	19	29	¶So when God destroyed the cities of the region, God honored Abraham’s request. He removed Lot from the midst of the destruction when he destroyed the cities Lot had lived in.
488	1	19	30	¶Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and settled in the mountains because he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters.
489	1	19	31	Later the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the country to sleep with us, the way everyone does.
490	1	19	32	Come, let’s make our father drunk with wine so we can go to bed with him and preserve our family line through our father.”
491	1	19	33	¶So that night they made their father drunk with wine, and the older daughter came in and went to bed with her father. But he was not aware of when she lay down with him or when she got up.
492	1	19	34	So in the morning the older daughter said to the younger, “Since I went to bed with my father last night, let’s make him drunk again tonight. Then you go in and go to bed with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.”
493	1	19	35	So they made their father drunk that night as well, and the younger one came and went to bed with him. But he was not aware of when she lay down with him or when she got up.
494	1	19	36	¶In this way both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.
495	1	19	37	The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the ancestor of the Moabites of today.
496	1	19	38	The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben Ammi. He is the ancestor of the Ammonites of today.
497	1	20	1	¶Abraham journeyed from there to the Negev region and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he lived as a temporary resident in Gerar,
498	1	20	2	Abraham said about his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her.
499	1	20	3	¶But God appeared to Abimelech in a dream at night and said to him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is someone else’s wife.”
500	1	20	4	¶Now Abimelech had not gone near her. He said, “Lord, would you really slaughter an innocent nation?
501	1	20	5	Did Abraham not say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this with a clear conscience and with innocent hands!”
502	1	20	6	¶Then in the dream God replied to him, “Yes, I know that you have done this with a clear conscience. That is why I have kept you from sinning against me and why I did not allow you to touch her.
503	1	20	7	But now give back the man’s wife. Indeed he is a prophet and he will pray for you; thus you will live. But if you don’t give her back, know that you will surely die along with all who belong to you.”
504	1	20	8	¶Early in the morning Abimelech summoned all his servants. When he told them about all these things, they were terrified.
505	1	20	9	Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? What sin did I commit against you that would cause you to bring such great guilt on me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done!”
506	1	20	10	Then Abimelech asked Abraham, “What prompted you to do this thing?”
507	1	20	11	¶Abraham replied, “Because I thought, ‘Surely no one fears God in this place. They will kill me because of my wife.’
508	1	20	12	What’s more, she is indeed my sister, my father’s daughter, but not my mother’s daughter. She became my wife.
509	1	20	13	When God made me wander from my father’s house, I told her, ‘This is what you can do to show your loyalty to me: Every place we go, say about me, “He is my brother.”’”
510	1	20	14	¶So Abimelech gave sheep, cattle, and male and female servants to Abraham. He also gave his wife Sarah back to him.
511	1	20	15	Then Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you; live wherever you please.”
512	1	20	16	¶To Sarah he said, “Look, I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your ‘brother.’ This is compensation for you so that you will stand vindicated before all who are with you.”
513	1	20	17	¶Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, as well as his wife and female slaves so that they were able to have children.
514	1	20	18	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had caused infertility to strike every woman in the household of Abimelech because he took Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
515	1	21	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> visited Sarah just as he had said he would and did for Sarah what he had promised.
516	1	21	2	So Sarah became pregnant and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the appointed time that God had told him.
517	1	21	3	Abraham named his son – whom Sarah bore to him – Isaac.
518	1	21	4	When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him just as God had commanded him to do.
519	1	21	5	(Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.)
520	1	21	6	¶Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.”
521	1	21	7	She went on to say, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son for him in his old age!”
522	1	21	8	¶The child grew and was weaned. Abraham prepared a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
523	1	21	9	But Sarah noticed the son of Hagar the Egyptian – the son whom Hagar had borne to Abraham – mocking.
524	1	21	10	So she said to Abraham, “Banish that slave woman and her son, for the son of that slave woman will not be an heir along with my son Isaac!”
525	1	21	11	¶Sarah’s demand displeased Abraham greatly because Ishmael was his son.
526	1	21	12	But God said to Abraham, “Do not be upset about the boy or your slave wife. Do all that Sarah is telling you because through Isaac your descendants will be counted.
527	1	21	13	But I will also make the son of the slave wife into a great nation, for he is your descendant too.”
528	1	21	14	¶Early in the morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He put them on her shoulders, gave her the child, and sent her away. So she went wandering aimlessly through the wilderness of Beer Sheba.
529	1	21	15	When the water in the skin was gone, she shoved the child under one of the shrubs.
530	1	21	16	Then she went and sat down by herself across from him at quite a distance, about a bowshot, away; for she thought, “I refuse to watch the child die.” So she sat across from him and wept uncontrollably.
531	1	21	17	¶But God heard the boy’s voice. The angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and asked her, “What is the matter, Hagar? Don’t be afraid, for God has heard the boy’s voice right where he is crying.
532	1	21	18	Get up! Help the boy up and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”
533	1	21	19	Then God enabled Hagar to see a well of water. She went over and filled the skin with water, and then gave the boy a drink.
534	1	21	20	¶God was with the boy as he grew. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer.
535	1	21	21	He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother found a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
536	1	21	22	¶At that time Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do.
537	1	21	23	Now swear to me right here in God’s name that you will not deceive me, my children, or my descendants. Show me, and the land where you are staying, the same loyalty that I have shown you.”
538	1	21	24	¶Abraham said, “I swear to do this.”
539	1	21	25	But Abraham lodged a complaint against Abimelech concerning a well that Abimelech’s servants had seized.
540	1	21	26	“I do not know who has done this thing,” Abimelech replied. “Moreover, you did not tell me. I did not hear about it until today.”
541	1	21	27	¶Abraham took some sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech. The two of them made a treaty.
542	1	21	28	Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs apart from the flock by themselves.
543	1	21	29	Abimelech asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?”
544	1	21	30	He replied, “You must take these seven ewe lambs from my hand as legal proof that I dug this well.”
545	1	21	31	That is why he named that place Beer Sheba, because the two of them swore an oath there.
546	1	21	32	¶So they made a treaty at Beer Sheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, returned to the land of the Philistines.
547	1	21	33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer Sheba. There he worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the eternal God.
548	1	21	34	So Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for quite some time.
549	1	22	1	¶Some time after these things God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am!” Abraham replied.
550	1	22	2	God said, “Take your son – your only son, whom you love, Isaac – and go to the land of Moriah! Offer him up there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will indicate to you.”
551	1	22	3	¶Early in the morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey. He took two of his young servants with him, along with his son Isaac. When he had cut the wood for the burnt offering, he started out for the place God had spoken to him about.
552	1	22	4	¶On the third day Abraham caught sight of the place in the distance.
553	1	22	5	So he said to his servants, “You two stay here with the donkey while the boy and I go up there. We will worship and then return to you.”
554	1	22	6	¶Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac. Then he took the fire and the knife in his hand, and the two of them walked on together.
555	1	22	7	Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father?” “What is it, my son?” he replied. “Here is the fire and the wood,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
556	1	22	8	“God will provide for himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son,” Abraham replied. The two of them continued on together.
557	1	22	9	¶When they came to the place God had told him about, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood on it. Next he tied up his son Isaac and placed him on the altar on top of the wood.
558	1	22	10	Then Abraham reached out his hand, took the knife, and prepared to slaughter his son.
559	1	22	11	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s angel called to him from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!” “Here I am!” he answered.
560	1	22	12	“Do not harm the boy!” the angel said. “Do not do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God because you did not withhold your son, your only son, from me.”
561	1	22	13	¶Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram caught in the bushes by its horns. So he went over and got the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.
562	1	22	14	And Abraham called the name of that place “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> provides.” It is said to this day, “In the mountain of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> provision will be made.”
563	1	22	15	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel called to Abraham a second time from heaven
564	1	22	16	and said, “‘I solemnly swear by my own name,’ decrees the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‘that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
565	1	22	17	I will indeed bless you, and I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be as countless as the stars in the sky or the grains of sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the strongholds of their enemies.
566	1	22	18	Because you have obeyed me, all the nations of the earth will pronounce blessings on one another using the name of your descendants.’”
567	1	22	19	¶Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set out together for Beer Sheba where Abraham stayed.
568	1	22	20	¶After these things Abraham was told, “Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor –
569	1	22	21	Uz the firstborn, his brother Buz, Kemuel (the father of Aram),
570	1	22	22	Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”
571	1	22	23	(Now Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.) These were the eight sons Milcah bore to Abraham’s brother Nahor.
572	1	22	24	His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore him children – Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
573	1	23	1	¶Sarah lived 127 years.
574	1	23	2	Then she died in Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
575	1	23	3	¶Then Abraham got up from mourning his dead wife and said to the sons of Heth,
576	1	23	4	“I am a foreign resident, a temporary settler, among you. Grant me ownership of a burial site among you so that I may bury my dead.”
577	1	23	5	¶The sons of Heth answered Abraham,
578	1	23	6	“Listen, sir, you are a mighty prince among us! You may bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb to prevent you from burying your dead.”
579	1	23	7	¶Abraham got up and bowed down to the local people, the sons of Heth.
580	1	23	8	Then he said to them, “If you agree that I may bury my dead, then hear me out. Ask Ephron the son of Zohar
581	1	23	9	if he will sell me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him; it is at the end of his field. Let him sell it to me publicly for the full price, so that I may own it as a burial site.”
582	1	23	10	¶(Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth.) Ephron the Hittite replied to Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth – before all who entered the gate of his city –
583	1	23	11	“No, my lord! Hear me out. I sell you both the field and the cave that is in it. In the presence of my people I sell it to you. Bury your dead.”
584	1	23	12	¶Abraham bowed before the local people
585	1	23	13	and said to Ephron in their hearing, “Hear me, if you will. I pay to you the price of the field. Take it from me so that I may bury my dead there.”
586	1	23	14	¶Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
587	1	23	15	“Hear me, my lord. The land is worth 400 pieces of silver, but what is that between me and you? So bury your dead.”
588	1	23	16	¶So Abraham agreed to Ephron’s price and weighed out for him the price that Ephron had quoted in the hearing of the sons of Heth – 400 pieces of silver, according to the standard measurement at the time.
589	1	23	17	¶So Abraham secured Ephron’s field in Machpelah, next to Mamre, including the field, the cave that was in it, and all the trees that were in the field and all around its border,
590	1	23	18	as his property in the presence of the sons of Heth before all who entered the gate of Ephron’s city.
591	1	23	19	¶After this Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah next to Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
592	1	23	20	So Abraham secured the field and the cave that was in it as a burial site from the sons of Heth.
593	1	24	1	¶Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had blessed him in everything.
594	1	24	2	Abraham said to his servant, the senior one in his household who was in charge of everything he had, “Put your hand under my thigh
595	1	24	3	so that I may make you solemnly promise by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of heaven and the God of the earth: You must not acquire a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living.
596	1	24	4	You must go instead to my country and to my relatives to find a wife for my son Isaac.”
597	1	24	5	¶The servant asked him, “What if the woman is not willing to come back with me to this land? Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?”
598	1	24	6	¶“Be careful never to take my son back there!” Abraham told him.
599	1	24	7	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and the land of my relatives, promised me with a solemn oath, ‘To your descendants I will give this land.’ He will send his angel before you so that you may find a wife for my son from there.
600	1	24	8	But if the woman is not willing to come back with you, you will be free from this oath of mine. But you must not take my son back there!”
601	1	24	9	So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and gave his solemn promise he would carry out his wishes.
602	1	24	10	¶Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed with all kinds of gifts from his master at his disposal. He journeyed to the region of Aram Naharaim and the city of Nahor.
603	1	24	11	He made the camels kneel down by the well outside the city. It was evening, the time when the women would go out to draw water.
604	1	24	12	He prayed, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, God of my master Abraham, guide me today. Be faithful to my master Abraham.
605	1	24	13	Here I am, standing by the spring, and the daughters of the people who live in the town are coming out to draw water.
606	1	24	14	I will say to a young woman, ‘Please lower your jar so I may drink.’ May the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac reply, ‘Drink, and I’ll give your camels water too.’ In this way I will know that you have been faithful to my master.”
607	1	24	15	¶Before he had finished praying, there came Rebekah with her water jug on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah (Milcah was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor).
608	1	24	16	Now the young woman was very beautiful. She was a virgin; no man had ever been physically intimate with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jug, and came back up.
609	1	24	17	Abraham’s servant ran to meet her and said, “Please give me a sip of water from your jug.”
610	1	24	18	“Drink, my lord,” she replied, and quickly lowering her jug to her hands, she gave him a drink.
611	1	24	19	When she had done so, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too, until they have drunk as much as they want.”
612	1	24	20	She quickly emptied her jug into the watering trough and ran back to the well to draw more water until she had drawn enough for all his camels.
613	1	24	21	Silently the man watched her with interest to determine if the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had made his journey successful or not.
614	1	24	22	¶After the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold wrist bracelets weighing ten shekels and gave them to her.
615	1	24	23	“Whose daughter are you?” he asked. “Tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”
616	1	24	24	¶She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom Milcah bore to Nahor.
617	1	24	25	We have plenty of straw and feed,” she added, “and room for you to spend the night.”
618	1	24	26	¶The man bowed his head and worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
619	1	24	27	saying “Praised be the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his faithful love for my master! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has led me to the house of my master’s relatives!”
620	1	24	28	¶The young woman ran and told her mother’s household all about these things.
621	1	24	29	(Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban.) Laban rushed out to meet the man at the spring.
622	1	24	30	When he saw the bracelets on his sister’s wrists and the nose ring and heard his sister Rebekah say, “This is what the man said to me,” he went out to meet the man. There he was, standing by the camels near the spring.
623	1	24	31	Laban said to him, “Come, you who are blessed by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! Why are you standing out here when I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?”
624	1	24	32	¶So Abraham’s servant went to the house and unloaded the camels. Straw and feed were given to the camels, and water was provided so that he and the men who were with him could wash their feet.
625	1	24	33	When food was served, he said, “I will not eat until I have said what I want to say.” “Tell us,” Laban said.
626	1	24	34	¶“I am the servant of Abraham,” he began.
627	1	24	35	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has richly blessed my master and he has become very wealthy. The Lord has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
628	1	24	36	My master’s wife Sarah bore a son to him when she was old, and my master has given him everything he owns.
629	1	24	37	My master made me swear an oath. He said, ‘You must not acquire a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living,
630	1	24	38	but you must go to the family of my father and to my relatives to find a wife for my son.’
631	1	24	39	But I said to my master, ‘What if the woman does not want to go with me?’
632	1	24	40	He answered, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you. He will make your journey a success and you will find a wife for my son from among my relatives, from my father’s family.
633	1	24	41	You will be free from your oath if you go to my relatives and they will not give her to you. Then you will be free from your oath.’
634	1	24	42	When I came to the spring today, I prayed, ‘O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, God of my master Abraham, if you have decided to make my journey successful, may events unfold as follows:
635	1	24	43	Here I am, standing by the spring. When the young woman goes out to draw water, I’ll say, “Please give me a little water to drink from your jug.”
636	1	24	44	Then she will reply to me, “Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too.” May that woman be the one whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has chosen for my master’s son.’
637	1	24	45	¶“Before I finished praying in my heart, along came Rebekah with her water jug on her shoulder! She went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’
638	1	24	46	She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll give your camels water too.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels water.
639	1	24	47	Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘The daughter of Bethuel the son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to Nahor.’ I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her wrists.
640	1	24	48	Then I bowed down and worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. I praised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right path to find the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son.
641	1	24	49	Now, if you will show faithful love to my master, tell me. But if not, tell me as well, so that I may go on my way.”
642	1	24	50	¶Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “This is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s doing. Our wishes are of no concern.
643	1	24	51	Rebekah stands here before you. Take her and go so that she may become the wife of your master’s son, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has decided.”
644	1	24	52	¶When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
645	1	24	53	Then he brought out gold, silver jewelry, and clothing and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave valuable gifts to her brother and to her mother.
646	1	24	54	After this, he and the men who were with him ate a meal and stayed there overnight. ¶When they got up in the morning, he said, “Let me leave now so I can return to my master.”
647	1	24	55	But Rebekah’s brother and her mother replied, “Let the girl stay with us a few more days, perhaps ten. Then she can go.”
648	1	24	56	But he said to them, “Don’t detain me – the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has granted me success on my journey. Let me leave now so I may return to my master.”
649	1	24	57	Then they said, “We’ll call the girl and find out what she wants to do.”
650	1	24	58	So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Do you want to go with this man?” She replied, “I want to go.”
651	1	24	59	¶So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, accompanied by her female attendant, with Abraham’s servant and his men.
652	1	24	60	They blessed Rebekah with these words: ‡“Our sister, may you become the mother of thousands of ten thousands! ‡May your descendants possess the strongholds of their enemies.”
653	1	24	61	¶Then Rebekah and her female servants mounted the camels and rode away with the man. So Abraham’s servant took Rebekah and left.
654	1	24	62	¶Now Isaac came from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.
655	1	24	63	He went out to relax in the field in the early evening. Then he looked up and saw that there were camels approaching.
656	1	24	64	Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel
657	1	24	65	and asked Abraham’s servant, “Who is that man walking in the field toward us?” “That is my master,” the servant replied. So she took her veil and covered herself.
658	1	24	66	¶The servant told Isaac everything that had happened.
659	1	24	67	Then Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah’s tent. He took her as his wife and loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
660	1	25	1	¶Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah.
661	1	25	2	She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
662	1	25	3	Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, Letushites, and Leummites.
663	1	25	4	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.
664	1	25	5	¶Everything he owned Abraham left to his son Isaac.
665	1	25	6	But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them off to the east, away from his son Isaac.
666	1	25	7	¶Abraham lived a total of 175 years.
667	1	25	8	Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man who had lived a full life. He joined his ancestors.
668	1	25	9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar, the Hittite.
669	1	25	10	This was the field Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.
670	1	25	11	After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac. Isaac lived near Beer Lahai Roi.
671	1	25	12	¶This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham.
672	1	25	13	¶These are the names of Ishmael’s sons, by their names according to their records: Nebaioth (Ishmael’s firstborn), Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
673	1	25	14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
674	1	25	15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
675	1	25	16	These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their settlements and their camps – twelve princes according to their clans.
676	1	25	17	¶Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. He breathed his last and died; then he joined his ancestors.
677	1	25	18	His descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which runs next to Egypt all the way to Asshur. They settled away from all their relatives.
678	1	25	19	¶This is the account of Isaac, the son of Abraham.¶Abraham became the father of Isaac.
679	1	25	20	When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.
680	1	25	21	¶Isaac prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on behalf of his wife because she was childless. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.
681	1	25	22	But the children struggled inside her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span>
682	1	25	23	and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to her,‡“Two nations are in your womb, ‡and two peoples will be separated from within you.‡One people will be stronger than the other,‡and the older will serve the younger.”
683	1	25	24	¶When the time came for Rebekah to give birth, there were twins in her womb.
684	1	25	25	The first came out reddish all over, like a hairy garment, so they named him Esau.
685	1	25	26	When his brother came out with his hand clutching Esau’s heel, they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.
686	1	25	27	¶When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter, a man of the open fields, but Jacob was an even-tempered man, living in tents.
687	1	25	28	Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for fresh game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
688	1	25	29	¶Now Jacob cooked some stew, and when Esau came in from the open fields, he was famished.
689	1	25	30	So Esau said to Jacob, “Feed me some of the red stuff – yes, this red stuff – because I’m starving!” (That is why he was also called Edom.)
690	1	25	31	¶But Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”
691	1	25	32	“Look,” said Esau, “I’m about to die! What use is the birthright to me?”
692	1	25	33	But Jacob said, “Swear an oath to me now.” So Esau swore an oath to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.
693	1	25	34	¶Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew; Esau ate and drank, then got up and went out. So Esau despised his birthright.
694	1	26	1	¶There was a famine in the land, subsequent to the earlier famine that occurred in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar.
695	1	26	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; settle down in the land that I will point out to you.
696	1	26	3	Stay in this land. Then I will be with you and will bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will fulfill the solemn promise I made to your father Abraham.
697	1	26	4	I will multiply your descendants so they will be as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all these lands. All the nations of the earth will pronounce blessings on one another using the name of your descendants.
698	1	26	5	All this will come to pass because Abraham obeyed me and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”
699	1	26	6	So Isaac settled in Gerar.
700	1	26	7	¶When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he replied, “She is my sister.” He was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” for he thought to himself, “The men of this place will kill me to get Rebekah because she is very beautiful.”
701	1	26	8	¶After Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines happened to look out a window and observed Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
702	1	26	9	So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac replied, “Because I thought someone might kill me to get her.”
703	1	26	10	¶Then Abimelech exclaimed, “What in the world have you done to us? One of the men nearly took your wife to bed, and you would have brought guilt on us!”
704	1	26	11	So Abimelech commanded all the people, “Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”
705	1	26	12	¶When Isaac planted in that land, he reaped in the same year a hundred times what he had sown, because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> blessed him.
706	1	26	13	The man became wealthy. His influence continued to grow until he became very prominent.
707	1	26	14	He had so many sheep and cattle and such a great household of servants that the Philistines became jealous of him.
708	1	26	15	So the Philistines took dirt and filled up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug back in the days of his father Abraham.
709	1	26	16	¶Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Leave us and go elsewhere, for you have become much more powerful than we are.”
710	1	26	17	So Isaac left there and settled in the Gerar Valley.
711	1	26	18	Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug back in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham died. Isaac gave these wells the same names his father had given them.
712	1	26	19	¶When Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well with fresh flowing water there,
713	1	26	20	the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water belongs to us!” So Isaac named the well Esek because they argued with him about it.
714	1	26	21	His servants dug another well, but they quarreled over it too, so Isaac named it Sitnah.
715	1	26	22	Then he moved away from there and dug another well. They did not quarrel over it, so Isaac named it Rehoboth, saying, “For now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has made room for us, and we will prosper in the land.”
716	1	26	23	¶From there Isaac went up to Beer Sheba.
717	1	26	24	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to him that night and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.”
718	1	26	25	Then Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well.
719	1	26	26	¶Now Abimelech had come to him from Gerar along with Ahuzzah his friend and Phicol the commander of his army.
720	1	26	27	Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me? You hate me and sent me away from you.”
721	1	26	28	They replied, “We could plainly see that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with you. So we decided there should be a pact between us – between us and you. Allow us to make a treaty with you
722	1	26	29	so that you will not do us any harm, just as we have not harmed you, but have always treated you well before sending you away in peace. Now you are blessed by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
723	1	26	30	¶So Isaac held a feast for them and they celebrated.
724	1	26	31	Early in the morning the men made a treaty with each other. Isaac sent them off; they separated on good terms.
725	1	26	32	¶That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. “We’ve found water,” they reported.
726	1	26	33	So he named it Shibah; that is why the name of the city has been Beer Sheba to this day.
727	1	26	34	¶When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, as well as Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
728	1	26	35	They caused Isaac and Rebekah great anxiety.
729	1	27	1	¶When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he was almost blind, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son!” “Here I am!” Esau replied.
730	1	27	2	Isaac said, “Since I am so old, I could die at any time.
731	1	27	3	Therefore, take your weapons – your quiver and your bow – and go out into the open fields and hunt down some wild game for me.
732	1	27	4	Then prepare for me some tasty food, the kind I love, and bring it to me. Then I will eat it so that I may bless you before I die.”
733	1	27	5	¶Now Rebekah had been listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau went out to the open fields to hunt down some wild game and bring it back,
734	1	27	6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father tell your brother Esau,
735	1	27	7	‘Bring me some wild game and prepare for me some tasty food. Then I will eat it and bless you in the presence of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> before I die.’
736	1	27	8	Now then, my son, do exactly what I tell you!
737	1	27	9	Go to the flock and get me two of the best young goats. I’ll prepare them in a tasty way for your father, just the way he loves them.
738	1	27	10	Then you will take it to your father. Thus he will eat it and bless you before he dies.”
739	1	27	11	¶“But Esau my brother is a hairy man,” Jacob protested to his mother Rebekah, “and I have smooth skin!
740	1	27	12	My father may touch me! Then he’ll think I’m mocking him and I’ll bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing.”
741	1	27	13	So his mother told him, “Any curse against you will fall on me, my son! Just obey me! Go and get them for me!”
742	1	27	14	¶So he went and got the goats and brought them to his mother. She prepared some tasty food, just the way his father loved it.
743	1	27	15	Then Rebekah took her older son Esau’s best clothes, which she had with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.
744	1	27	16	She put the skins of the young goats on his hands and the smooth part of his neck.
745	1	27	17	Then she handed the tasty food and the bread she had made to her son Jacob.
746	1	27	18	¶He went to his father and said, “My father!” Isaac replied, “Here I am. Which are you, my son?”
747	1	27	19	Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I’ve done as you told me. Now sit up and eat some of my wild game so that you can bless me.”
748	1	27	20	But Isaac asked his son, “How in the world did you find it so quickly, my son?” “Because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God brought it to me,” he replied.
749	1	27	21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come closer so I can touch you, my son, and know for certain if you really are my son Esau.”
750	1	27	22	So Jacob went over to his father Isaac, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s, but the hands are Esau’s.”
751	1	27	23	He did not recognize him because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau’s hands. So Isaac blessed Jacob.
752	1	27	24	Then he asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” “I am,” Jacob replied.
753	1	27	25	Isaac said, “Bring some of the wild game for me to eat, my son. Then I will bless you.” So Jacob brought it to him, and he ate it. He also brought him wine, and Isaac drank.
754	1	27	26	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here and kiss me, my son.”
755	1	27	27	So Jacob went over and kissed him. When Isaac caught the scent of his clothing, he blessed him, saying,‡“Yes, my son smells‡like the scent of an open field‡which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has blessed.
756	1	27	28	‡May God give you‡the dew of the sky ‡and the richness of the earth,‡and plenty of grain and new wine.
757	1	27	29	‡May peoples serve you‡and nations bow down to you.‡You will be lord over your brothers,‡and the sons of your mother will bow down to you. ‡May those who curse you be cursed,‡and those who bless you be blessed.”
758	1	27	30	¶Isaac had just finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, when his brother Esau returned from the hunt.
759	1	27	31	He also prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Esau said to him, “My father, get up and eat some of your son’s wild game. Then you can bless me.”
760	1	27	32	His father Isaac asked, “Who are you?” “I am your firstborn son,” he replied, “Esau!”
761	1	27	33	Isaac began to shake violently and asked, “Then who else hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it just before you arrived, and I blessed him. He will indeed be blessed!”
762	1	27	34	¶When Esau heard his father’s words, he wailed loudly and bitterly. He said to his father, “Bless me too, my father!”
763	1	27	35	But Isaac replied, “Your brother came in here deceitfully and took away your blessing.”
764	1	27	36	Esau exclaimed, “‘Jacob is the right name for him! He has tripped me up two times! He took away my birthright, and now, look, he has taken away my blessing!” Then he asked, “Have you not kept back a blessing for me?”
765	1	27	37	¶Isaac replied to Esau, “Look! I have made him lord over you. I have made all his relatives his servants and provided him with grain and new wine. What is left that I can do for you, my son?”
766	1	27	38	Esau said to his father, “Do you have only that one blessing, my father? Bless me too!” Then Esau wept loudly.
767	1	27	39	¶So his father Isaac said to him,‡“See here, your home will be by the richness of the earth,‡and by the dew of the sky above.
768	1	27	40	‡You will live by your sword‡but you will serve your brother.‡When you grow restless,‡you will tear off his yoke‡from your neck.”
769	1	27	41	¶So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing his father had given to his brother. Esau said privately, “The time of mourning for my father is near; then I will kill my brother Jacob!”
770	1	27	42	¶When Rebekah heard what her older son Esau had said, she quickly summoned her younger son Jacob and told him, “Look, your brother Esau is planning to get revenge by killing you.
771	1	27	43	Now then, my son, do what I say. Run away immediately to my brother Laban in Haran.
772	1	27	44	Live with him for a little while until your brother’s rage subsides.
773	1	27	45	Stay there until your brother’s anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. Then I’ll send someone to bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”
774	1	27	46	¶Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am deeply depressed because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob were to marry one of these daughters of Heth who live in this land, I would want to die!”
775	1	28	1	¶So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him, “You must not marry a Canaanite woman!
776	1	28	2	Leave immediately for Paddan Aram! Go to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father, and find yourself a wife there, among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.
777	1	28	3	May the Sovereign God bless you! May he make you fruitful and give you a multitude of descendants! Then you will become a large nation.
778	1	28	4	May he give you and your descendants the blessing he gave to Abraham so that you may possess the land God gave to Abraham, the land where you have been living as a temporary resident.”
779	1	28	5	So Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean and brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
780	1	28	6	¶Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him off to Paddan Aram to find a wife there. As he blessed him, Isaac commanded him, “You must not marry a Canaanite woman.”
781	1	28	7	Jacob obeyed his father and mother and left for Paddan Aram.
782	1	28	8	Then Esau realized that the Canaanite women were displeasing to his father Isaac.
783	1	28	9	So Esau went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael, along with the wives he already had.
784	1	28	10	¶Meanwhile Jacob left Beer Sheba and set out for Haran.
785	1	28	11	He reached a certain place where he decided to camp because the sun had gone down. He took one of the stones and placed it near his head. Then he fell asleep in that place
786	1	28	12	and had a dream. He saw a stairway erected on the earth with its top reaching to the heavens. The angels of God were going up and coming down it
787	1	28	13	and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> stood at its top. He said, “I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of your father Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the ground you are lying on.
788	1	28	14	Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west, east, north, and south. And so all the families of the earth may receive blessings through you and through your descendants.
789	1	28	15	I am with you! I will protect you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I promised you!”
790	1	28	16	¶Then Jacob woke up and thought, “Surely the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is in this place, but I did not realize it!”
791	1	28	17	He was afraid and said, “What an awesome place this is! This is nothing else than the house of God! This is the gate of heaven!”
792	1	28	18	¶Early in the morning Jacob took the stone he had placed near his head and set it up as a sacred stone. Then he poured oil on top of it.
793	1	28	19	He called that place Bethel, although the former name of the town was Luz.
794	1	28	20	Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God is with me and protects me on this journey I am taking and gives me food to eat and clothing to wear,
795	1	28	21	and I return safely to my father’s home, then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will become my God.
796	1	28	22	Then this stone that I have set up as a sacred stone will be the house of God, and I will surely give you back a tenth of everything you give me.”
797	1	29	1	¶So Jacob moved on and came to the land of the eastern people.
798	1	29	2	He saw in the field a well with three flocks of sheep lying beside it, because the flocks were watered from that well. Now a large stone covered the mouth of the well.
799	1	29	3	When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone off the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would put the stone back in its place over the well’s mouth.
800	1	29	4	¶Jacob asked them, “My brothers, where are you from?” They replied, “We’re from Haran.”
801	1	29	5	So he said to them, “Do you know Laban, the grandson of Nahor?” “We know him,” they said.
802	1	29	6	“Is he well?” Jacob asked. They replied, “He is well. Now look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”
803	1	29	7	Then Jacob said, “Since it is still the middle of the day, it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. You should water the sheep and then go and let them graze some more.”
804	1	29	8	“We can’t,” they said, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled off the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep.”
805	1	29	9	¶While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep, for she was tending them.
806	1	29	10	When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban, and the sheep of his uncle Laban, he went over and rolled the stone off the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of his uncle Laban.
807	1	29	11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep loudly.
808	1	29	12	When Jacob explained to Rachel that he was a relative of her father and the son of Rebekah, she ran and told her father.
809	1	29	13	When Laban heard this news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he rushed out to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban how he was related to him.
810	1	29	14	Then Laban said to him, “You are indeed my own flesh and blood.” So Jacob stayed with him for a month.
811	1	29	15	¶Then Laban said to Jacob, “Should you work for me for nothing because you are my relative? Tell me what your wages should be.”
812	1	29	16	(Now Laban had two daughters; the older one was named Leah, and the younger one Rachel.
813	1	29	17	Leah’s eyes were tender, but Rachel had a lovely figure and beautiful appearance.)
814	1	29	18	Since Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, he said, “I’ll serve you seven years in exchange for your younger daughter Rachel.”
815	1	29	19	Laban replied, “I’d rather give her to you than to another man. Stay with me.”
816	1	29	20	So Jacob worked for seven years to acquire Rachel. But they seemed like only a few days to him because his love for her was so great.
817	1	29	21	¶Finally Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time of service is up. And I want to sleep with her.”
818	1	29	22	So Laban invited all the people of that place and prepared a feast.
819	1	29	23	In the evening he brought his daughter Leah to Jacob, and he slept with her.
820	1	29	24	(Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)
821	1	29	25	¶In the morning Jacob discovered it was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What in the world have you done to me! Didn’t I work for you in exchange for Rachel? Why have you tricked me?”
822	1	29	26	“It is not our custom here,” Laban replied, “to give the younger daughter in marriage before the firstborn.
823	1	29	27	Complete my older daughter’s bridal week. Then we will give you the younger one too, in exchange for seven more years of work.”
824	1	29	28	¶Jacob did as Laban said. When Jacob completed Leah’s bridal week, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
825	1	29	29	(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.)
826	1	29	30	Jacob slept with Rachel as well. He also loved Rachel more than Leah. Then he worked for Laban for seven more years.
827	1	29	31	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> saw that Leah was unloved, he enabled her to become pregnant while Rachel remained childless.
828	1	29	32	So Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has looked with pity on my oppressed condition. Surely my husband will love me now.”
829	1	29	33	¶She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, “Because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> heard that I was unloved, he gave me this one too.” So she named him Simeon.
830	1	29	34	¶She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, “Now this time my husband will show me affection, because I have given birth to three sons for him.” That is why he was named Levi.
831	1	29	35	¶She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, “This time I will praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”That is why she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.
832	1	30	1	¶When Rachel saw that she could not give Jacob children, she became jealous of her sister. She said to Jacob, “Give me children or I’ll die!”
833	1	30	2	Jacob became furious with Rachel and exclaimed, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?”
834	1	30	3	She replied, “Here is my servant Bilhah! Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I can have a family through her.”
835	1	30	4	¶So Rachel gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob slept with her.
836	1	30	5	Bilhah became pregnant and gave Jacob a son.
837	1	30	6	Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me. He has responded to my prayer and given me a son.” That is why she named him Dan.
838	1	30	7	¶Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, became pregnant again and gave Jacob another son.
839	1	30	8	Then Rachel said, “I have fought a desperate struggle with my sister, but I have won.” So she named him Naphtali.
840	1	30	9	¶When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife.
841	1	30	10	Soon Leah’s servant Zilpah gave Jacob a son.
842	1	30	11	Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad.
843	1	30	12	¶Then Leah’s servant Zilpah gave Jacob another son.
844	1	30	13	Leah said, “How happy I am, for women will call me happy!” So she named him Asher.
845	1	30	14	¶At the time of the wheat harvest Reuben went out and found some mandrake plants in a field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
846	1	30	15	But Leah replied, “Wasn’t it enough that you’ve taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes too?” “All right,” Rachel said, “he may go to bed with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”
847	1	30	16	When Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must sleep with me because I have paid for your services with my son’s mandrakes.” So he went to bed with her that night.
848	1	30	17	God paid attention to Leah; she became pregnant and gave Jacob a son for the fifth time.
849	1	30	18	Then Leah said, “God has granted me a reward because I gave my servant to my husband as a wife.” So she named him Issachar.
850	1	30	19	¶Leah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a son for the sixth time.
851	1	30	20	Then Leah said, “God has given me a good gift. Now my husband will honor me because I have given him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun.
852	1	30	21	¶After that she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
853	1	30	22	¶Then God took note of Rachel. He paid attention to her and enabled her to become pregnant.
854	1	30	23	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Then she said, “God has taken away my shame.”
855	1	30	24	She named him Joseph, saying, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> give me yet another son.”
856	1	30	25	¶After Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so that I can go home to my own country.
857	1	30	26	Let me take my wives and my children whom I have acquired by working for you. Then I’ll depart, because you know how hard I’ve worked for you.”
858	1	30	27	¶But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your sight, please stay here, for I have learned by divination that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has blessed me on account of you.”
859	1	30	28	He added, “Just name your wages – I’ll pay whatever you want.”
860	1	30	29	¶“You know how I have worked for you,” Jacob replied, “and how well your livestock have fared under my care.
861	1	30	30	Indeed, you had little before I arrived, but now your possessions have increased many times over. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has blessed you wherever I worked. But now, how long must it be before I do something for my own family too?”
862	1	30	31	¶So Laban asked, “What should I give you?” “You don’t need to give me a thing,” Jacob replied, “but if you agree to this one condition, I will continue to care for your flocks and protect them:
863	1	30	32	Let me walk among all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and the spotted or speckled goats. These animals will be my wages.
864	1	30	33	My integrity will testify for me later on. When you come to verify that I’ve taken only the wages we agreed on, if I have in my possession any goat that is not speckled or spotted or any sheep that is not dark-colored, it will be considered stolen.”
865	1	30	34	“Agreed!” said Laban, “It will be as you say.”
866	1	30	35	¶So that day Laban removed the male goats that were streaked or spotted, all the female goats that were speckled or spotted (all that had any white on them), and all the dark-colored lambs, and put them in the care of his sons.
867	1	30	36	Then he separated them from Jacob by a three-day journey, while Jacob was taking care of the rest of Laban’s flocks.
868	1	30	37	¶But Jacob took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees. He made white streaks by peeling them, making the white inner wood in the branches visible.
869	1	30	38	Then he set up the peeled branches in all the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. He set up the branches in front of the flocks when they were in heat and came to drink.
870	1	30	39	When the sheep mated in front of the branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.
871	1	30	40	Jacob removed these lambs, but he made the rest of the flock face the streaked and completely dark-colored animals in Laban’s flock. So he made separate flocks for himself and did not mix them with Laban’s flocks.
872	1	30	41	When the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would set up the branches in the troughs in front of the flock, so they would mate near the branches.
873	1	30	42	But if the animals were weaker, he did not set the branches there. So the weaker animals ended up belonging to Laban and the stronger animals to Jacob.
874	1	30	43	In this way Jacob became extremely prosperous. He owned large flocks, male and female servants, camels, and donkeys.
875	1	31	1	¶Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were complaining, “Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father! He has gotten rich at our father’s expense!”
876	1	31	2	When Jacob saw the look on Laban’s face, he could tell his attitude toward him had changed.
877	1	31	3	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives. I will be with you.”
878	1	31	4	So Jacob sent a message for Rachel and Leah to come to the field where his flocks were.
879	1	31	5	There he said to them, “I can tell that your father’s attitude toward me has changed, but the God of my father has been with me.
880	1	31	6	You know that I’ve worked for your father as hard as I could,
881	1	31	7	but your father has humiliated me and changed my wages ten times. But God has not permitted him to do me any harm.
882	1	31	8	If he said, ‘The speckled animals will be your wage,’ then the entire flock gave birth to speckled offspring. But if he said, ‘The streaked animals will be your wage,’ then the entire flock gave birth to streaked offspring.
883	1	31	9	In this way God has snatched away your father’s livestock and given them to me.
884	1	31	10	¶“Once during breeding season I saw in a dream that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled, and spotted.
885	1	31	11	In the dream the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ ‘Here I am!’ I replied.
886	1	31	12	Then he said, ‘Observe that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled, or spotted, for I have observed all that Laban has done to you.
887	1	31	13	I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the sacred stone and made a vow to me. Now leave this land immediately and return to your native land.’”
888	1	31	14	¶Then Rachel and Leah replied to him, “Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father’s house?
889	1	31	15	Hasn’t he treated us like foreigners? He not only sold us, but completely wasted the money paid for us!
890	1	31	16	Surely all the wealth that God snatched away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So now do everything God has told you.”
891	1	31	17	¶So Jacob immediately put his children and his wives on the camels.
892	1	31	18	He took away all the livestock he had acquired in Paddan Aram and all his moveable property that he had accumulated. Then he set out toward the land of Canaan to return to his father Isaac.
893	1	31	19	¶While Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole the household idols that belonged to her father.
894	1	31	20	Jacob also deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was leaving.
895	1	31	21	He left with all he owned. He quickly crossed the Euphrates River and headed for the hill country of Gilead.
896	1	31	22	¶Three days later Laban discovered Jacob had left.
897	1	31	23	So he took his relatives with him and pursued Jacob for seven days. He caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
898	1	31	24	But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and warned him, “Be careful that you neither bless nor curse Jacob.”
899	1	31	25	¶Laban overtook Jacob, and when Jacob pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead, Laban and his relatives set up camp there too.
900	1	31	26	“What have you done?” Laban demanded of Jacob. “You’ve deceived me and carried away my daughters as if they were captives of war!
901	1	31	27	Why did you run away secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me so I could send you off with a celebration complete with singing, tambourines, and harps?
902	1	31	28	You didn’t even allow me to kiss my daughters and my grandchildren goodbye. You have acted foolishly!
903	1	31	29	I have the power to do you harm, but the God of your father told me last night, ‘Be careful that you neither bless nor curse Jacob.’
904	1	31	30	Now I understand that you have gone away because you longed desperately for your father’s house. Yet why did you steal my gods?”
905	1	31	31	¶“I left secretly because I was afraid!” Jacob replied to Laban. “I thought you might take your daughters away from me by force.
906	1	31	32	Whoever has taken your gods will be put to death! In the presence of our relatives identify whatever is yours and take it.” (Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.)
907	1	31	33	¶So Laban entered Jacob’s tent, and Leah’s tent, and the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find the idols. Then he left Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s.
908	1	31	34	(Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them inside her camel’s saddle and sat on them.) Laban searched the whole tent, but did not find them.
909	1	31	35	Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord. I cannot stand up in your presence because I am having my period.” So he searched thoroughly, but did not find the idols.
910	1	31	36	¶Jacob became angry and argued with Laban. “What did I do wrong?” he demanded of Laban. “What sin of mine prompted you to chase after me in hot pursuit?
911	1	31	37	When you searched through all my goods, did you find anything that belonged to you? Set it here before my relatives and yours, and let them settle the dispute between the two of us!
912	1	31	38	¶“I have been with you for the past twenty years. Your ewes and female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.
913	1	31	39	Animals torn by wild beasts I never brought to you; I always absorbed the loss myself. You always made me pay for every missing animal, whether it was taken by day or at night.
914	1	31	40	I was consumed by scorching heat during the day and by piercing cold at night, and I went without sleep.
915	1	31	41	This was my lot for twenty years in your house: I worked like a slave for you – fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, but you changed my wages ten times!
916	1	31	42	If the God of my father – the God of Abraham, the one whom Isaac fears – had not been with me, you would certainly have sent me away empty-handed! But God saw how I was oppressed and how hard I worked, and he rebuked you last night.”
917	1	31	43	¶Laban replied to Jacob, “These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks. All that you see belongs to me. But how can I harm these daughters of mine today or the children to whom they have given birth?
918	1	31	44	So now, come, let’s make a formal agreement, you and I, and it will be proof that we have made peace.”
919	1	31	45	¶So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial pillar.
920	1	31	46	Then he said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” So they brought stones and put them in a pile. They ate there by the pile of stones.
921	1	31	47	Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
922	1	31	48	¶Laban said, “This pile of stones is a witness of our agreement today.” That is why it was called Galeed.
923	1	31	49	It was also called Mizpah because he said, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> watch between us when we are out of sight of one another.
924	1	31	50	If you mistreat my daughters or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one else is with us, realize that God is witness to your actions.”
925	1	31	51	¶“Here is this pile of stones and this pillar I have set up between me and you,” Laban said to Jacob.
926	1	31	52	“This pile of stones and the pillar are reminders that I will not pass beyond this pile to come to harm you and that you will not pass beyond this pile and this pillar to come to harm me.
927	1	31	53	May the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor, the gods of their father, judge between us.” Jacob took an oath by the God whom his father Isaac feared.
928	1	31	54	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat the meal. They ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain.
929	1	31	55	¶(32:1) Early in the morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters goodbye and blessed them. Then Laban left and returned home.
930	1	32	1	¶So Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him.
931	1	32	2	When Jacob saw them, he exclaimed, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim.
932	1	32	3	¶Jacob sent messengers on ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the region of Edom.
933	1	32	4	He commanded them, “This is what you must say to my lord Esau: ‘This is what your servant Jacob says: I have been staying with Laban until now.
934	1	32	5	I have oxen, donkeys, sheep, and male and female servants. I have sent this message to inform my lord, so that I may find favor in your sight.’”
935	1	32	6	¶The messengers returned to Jacob and said, “We went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you and has four hundred men with him.”
936	1	32	7	Jacob was very afraid and upset. So he divided the people who were with him into two camps, as well as the flocks, herds, and camels.
937	1	32	8	“If Esau attacks one camp,” he thought, “then the other camp will be able to escape.”
938	1	32	9	¶Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives and I will make you prosper.’
939	1	32	10	I am not worthy of all the faithful love you have shown your servant. With only my walking stick I crossed the Jordan, but now I have become two camps.
940	1	32	11	Rescue me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, as well as the mothers with their children.
941	1	32	12	But you said, ‘I will certainly make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand on the seashore, too numerous to count.’”
942	1	32	13	¶Jacob stayed there that night. Then he sent as a gift to his brother Esau
943	1	32	14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
944	1	32	15	thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
945	1	32	16	He entrusted them to his servants, who divided them into herds. He told his servants, “Pass over before me, and keep some distance between one herd and the next.”
946	1	32	17	He instructed the servant leading the first herd, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong? Where are you going? Whose herds are you driving?’
947	1	32	18	then you must say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They have been sent as a gift to my lord Esau. In fact Jacob himself is behind us.’”
948	1	32	19	¶He also gave these instructions to the second and third servants, as well as all those who were following the herds, saying, “You must say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
949	1	32	20	You must also say, ‘In fact your servant Jacob is behind us.’” Jacob thought, “I will first appease him by sending a gift ahead of me. After that I will meet him. Perhaps he will accept me.”
950	1	32	21	So the gifts were sent on ahead of him while he spent that night in the camp.
951	1	32	22	¶During the night Jacob quickly took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
952	1	32	23	He took them and sent them across the stream along with all his possessions.
953	1	32	24	So Jacob was left alone. Then a man wrestled with him until daybreak.
954	1	32	25	When the man saw that he could not defeat Jacob, he struck the socket of his hip so the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated while he wrestled with him.
955	1	32	26	¶Then the man said, “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” “I will not let you go,” Jacob replied, “unless you bless me.”
956	1	32	27	The man asked him, “What is your name?” He answered, “Jacob.”
957	1	32	28	“No longer will your name be Jacob,” the man told him, “but Israel, because you have fought with God and with men and have prevailed.”
958	1	32	29	¶Then Jacob asked, “Please tell me your name.” “Why do you ask my name?” the man replied. Then he blessed Jacob there.
959	1	32	30	So Jacob named the place Peniel, explaining, “Certainly I have seen God face to face and have survived.”
960	1	32	31	¶The sun rose over him as he crossed over Penuel, but he was limping because of his hip.
961	1	32	32	That is why to this day the Israelites do not eat the sinew which is attached to the socket of the hip, because he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip near the attached sinew.
962	1	33	1	¶Jacob looked up and saw that Esau was coming along with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two female servants.
963	1	33	2	He put the servants and their children in front, with Leah and her children behind them, and Rachel and Joseph behind them.
964	1	33	3	But Jacob himself went on ahead of them, and he bowed toward the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
965	1	33	4	But Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, hugged his neck, and kissed him. Then they both wept.
966	1	33	5	When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he asked, “Who are these people with you?” Jacob replied, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”
967	1	33	6	The female servants came forward with their children and bowed down.
968	1	33	7	Then Leah came forward with her children and they bowed down. Finally Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed down.
969	1	33	8	¶Esau then asked, “What did you intend by sending all these herds to meet me?” Jacob replied, “To find favor in your sight, my lord.”
970	1	33	9	But Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother. Keep what belongs to you.”
971	1	33	10	“No, please take them,” Jacob said. “If I have found favor in your sight, accept my gift from my hand. Now that I have seen your face and you have accepted me, it is as if I have seen the face of God.
972	1	33	11	Please take my present that was brought to you, for God has been generous to me and I have all I need.” When Jacob urged him, he took it.
973	1	33	12	¶Then Esau said, “Let’s be on our way! I will go in front of you.”
974	1	33	13	But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are young, and that I have to look after the sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven too hard for even a single day, all the animals will die.
975	1	33	14	Let my lord go on ahead of his servant. I will travel more slowly, at the pace of the herds and the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”
976	1	33	15	¶So Esau said, “Let me leave some of my men with you.” “Why do that?” Jacob replied. “My lord has already been kind enough to me.”
977	1	33	16	¶So that same day Esau made his way back to Seir.
978	1	33	17	But Jacob traveled to Succoth where he built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place was called Succoth.
979	1	33	18	¶After he left Paddan Aram, Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped near the city.
980	1	33	19	Then he purchased the portion of the field where he had pitched his tent; he bought it from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money.
981	1	33	20	There he set up an altar and called it “The God of Israel is God.”
982	1	34	1	¶Now Dinah, Leah’s daughter whom she bore to Jacob, went to meet the young women of the land.
983	1	34	2	When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, who ruled that area, saw her, he grabbed her, forced himself on her, and sexually assaulted her.
984	1	34	3	Then he became very attached to Dinah, Jacob’s daughter. He fell in love with the young woman and spoke romantically to her.
985	1	34	4	Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Acquire this young girl as my wife.”
986	1	34	5	When Jacob heard that Shechem had violated his daughter Dinah, his sons were with the livestock in the field. So Jacob remained silent until they came in.
987	1	34	6	¶Then Shechem’s father Hamor went to speak with Jacob about Dinah.
988	1	34	7	Now Jacob’s sons had come in from the field when they heard the news. They were offended and very angry because Shechem had disgraced Israel by sexually assaulting Jacob’s daughter, a crime that should not be committed.
989	1	34	8	¶But Hamor made this appeal to them: “My son Shechem is in love with your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.
990	1	34	9	Intermarry with us. Let us marry your daughters, and take our daughters as wives for yourselves.
991	1	34	10	You may live among us, and the land will be open to you. Live in it, travel freely in it, and acquire property in it.”
992	1	34	11	¶Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in your sight, and whatever you require of me I’ll give.
993	1	34	12	You can make the bride price and the gift I must bring very expensive, and I’ll give whatever you ask of me. Just give me the young woman as my wife!”
994	1	34	13	¶Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully when they spoke because Shechem had violated their sister Dinah.
995	1	34	14	They said to them, “We cannot give our sister to a man who is not circumcised, for it would be a disgrace to us.
996	1	34	15	We will give you our consent on this one condition: You must become like us by circumcising all your males.
997	1	34	16	Then we will give you our daughters to marry, and we will take your daughters as wives for ourselves, and we will live among you and become one people.
998	1	34	17	But if you do not agree to our terms by being circumcised, then we will take our sister and depart.”
999	1	34	18	¶Their offer pleased Hamor and his son Shechem.
1000	1	34	19	The young man did not delay in doing what they asked because he wanted Jacob’s daughter Dinah badly. (Now he was more important than anyone in his father’s household.)
1001	1	34	20	So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city,
1002	1	34	21	“These men are at peace with us. So let them live in the land and travel freely in it, for the land is wide enough for them. We will take their daughters for wives, and we will give them our daughters to marry.
1003	1	34	22	Only on this one condition will these men consent to live with us and become one people: They demand that every male among us be circumcised just as they are circumcised.
1004	1	34	23	If we do so, won’t their livestock, their property, and all their animals become ours? So let’s consent to their demand, so they will live among us.”
1005	1	34	24	¶All the men who assembled at the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem. Every male who assembled at the city gate was circumcised.
1006	1	34	25	In three days, when they were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and went to the unsuspecting city and slaughtered every male.
1007	1	34	26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and left.
1008	1	34	27	Jacob’s sons killed them and looted the city because their sister had been violated.
1009	1	34	28	They took their flocks, herds, and donkeys, as well as everything in the city and in the surrounding fields.
1010	1	34	29	They captured as plunder all their wealth, all their little ones, and their wives, including everything in the houses.
1011	1	34	30	¶Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought ruin on me by making me a foul odor among the inhabitants of the land – among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number; they will join forces against me and attack me, and both I and my family will be destroyed!”
1012	1	34	31	But Simeon and Levi replied, “Should he treat our sister like a common prostitute?”
1013	1	35	1	¶Then God said to Jacob, “Go up at once to Bethel and live there. Make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”
1014	1	35	2	So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have among you. Purify yourselves and change your clothes.
1015	1	35	3	Let us go up at once to Bethel. Then I will make an altar there to God, who responded to me in my time of distress and has been with me wherever I went.”
1016	1	35	4	¶So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods that were in their possession and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem
1017	1	35	5	and they started on their journey. The surrounding cities were afraid of God, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
1018	1	35	6	¶Jacob and all those who were with him arrived at Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.
1019	1	35	7	He built an altar there and named the place El Bethel because there God had revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.
1020	1	35	8	(Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel; thus it was named Oak of Weeping.)
1021	1	35	9	¶God appeared to Jacob again after he returned from Paddan Aram and blessed him.
1022	1	35	10	God said to him, “Your name is Jacob, but your name will no longer be called Jacob; Israel will be your name.” So God named him Israel.
1023	1	35	11	Then God said to him, “I am the Sovereign God. Be fruitful and multiply! A nation – even a company of nations – will descend from you; kings will be among your descendants!
1024	1	35	12	The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you. To your descendants I will also give this land.”
1025	1	35	13	Then God went up from the place where he spoke with him.
1026	1	35	14	So Jacob set up a sacred stone pillar in the place where God spoke with him. He poured out a drink offering on it, and then he poured oil on it.
1027	1	35	15	Jacob named the place where God spoke with him Bethel.
1028	1	35	16	¶They traveled on from Bethel, and when Ephrath was still some distance away, Rachel went into labor – and her labor was hard.
1029	1	35	17	When her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you are having another son.”
1030	1	35	18	With her dying breath, she named him Ben Oni. But his father called him Benjamin instead.
1031	1	35	19	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
1032	1	35	20	Jacob set up a marker over her grave; it is the Marker of Rachel’s Grave to this day.
1033	1	35	21	¶Then Israel traveled on and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.
1034	1	35	22	While Israel was living in that land, Reuben went to bed with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel heard about it.¶Jacob had twelve sons:
1035	1	35	23	‡The sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, as well as Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
1036	1	35	24	‡The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
1037	1	35	25	‡The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, were Dan and Naphtali.
1038	1	35	26	‡The sons of Zilpah, Leah’s servant, were Gad and Asher.¶These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan Aram.
1039	1	35	27	¶So Jacob came back to his father Isaac in Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.
1040	1	35	28	Isaac lived to be 180 years old.
1041	1	35	29	Then Isaac breathed his last and joined his ancestors. He died an old man who had lived a full life. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
1042	1	36	1	¶What follows is the account of Esau (also known as Edom).
1043	1	36	2	¶Esau took his wives from the Canaanites: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
1044	1	36	3	in addition to Basemath the daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
1045	1	36	4	¶Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel,
1046	1	36	5	and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
1047	1	36	6	¶Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, all the people in his household, his livestock, his animals, and all his possessions which he had acquired in the land of Canaan and went to a land some distance away from Jacob his brother
1048	1	36	7	because they had too many possessions to be able to stay together and the land where they had settled was not able to support them because of their livestock.
1049	1	36	8	So Esau (also known as Edom) lived in the hill country of Seir.
1050	1	36	9	¶This is the account of Esau, the father of the Edomites, in the hill country of Seir.
1051	1	36	10	¶These were the names of Esau’s sons:¶Eliphaz, the son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau’s wife Basemath.
1052	1	36	11	¶The sons of Eliphaz were:¶Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
1053	1	36	12	¶Timna, a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz, bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Esau’s wife Adah.
1054	1	36	13	¶These were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
1055	1	36	14	¶These were the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon: She bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah to Esau.
1056	1	36	15	¶These were the chiefs among the descendants of Esau, the sons of Eliphaz, Esau’s firstborn: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,
1057	1	36	16	chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These were the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.
1058	1	36	17	¶These were the sons of Esau’s son Reuel: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
1059	1	36	18	¶These were the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These were the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
1060	1	36	19	¶These were the sons of Esau (also known as Edom), and these were their chiefs.
1061	1	36	20	¶These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
1062	1	36	21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, the descendants of Seir in the land of Edom.
1063	1	36	22	¶The sons of Lotan were Hori and Homam; Lotan’s sister was Timna.
1064	1	36	23	¶These were the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
1065	1	36	24	¶These were the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah (who discovered the hot springs in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon).
1066	1	36	25	¶These were the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
1067	1	36	26	¶These were the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran.
1068	1	36	27	¶These were the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
1069	1	36	28	¶These were the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
1070	1	36	29	¶These were the chiefs of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
1071	1	36	30	chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, according to their chief lists in the land of Seir.
1072	1	36	31	¶These were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites:
1073	1	36	32	¶Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; the name of his city was Dinhabah.
1074	1	36	33	¶When Bela died, Jobab the son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place.
1075	1	36	34	¶When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.
1076	1	36	35	¶When Husham died, Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated the Midianites in the land of Moab, reigned in his place; the name of his city was Avith.
1077	1	36	36	¶When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place.
1078	1	36	37	¶When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the River reigned in his place.
1079	1	36	38	¶When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place.
1080	1	36	39	¶When Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor died, Hadad reigned in his place; the name of his city was Pau. His wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-Zahab.
1081	1	36	40	¶These were the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families, according to their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
1082	1	36	41	chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
1083	1	36	42	chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,
1084	1	36	43	chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they possessed. This was Esau, the father of the Edomites.
1085	1	37	1	¶But Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, in the land of Canaan.
1086	1	37	2	¶This is the account of Jacob.¶Joseph, his seventeen-year-old son, was taking care of the flocks with his brothers. Now he was a youngster working with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father.
1087	1	37	3	¶Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because he was a son born to him late in life, and he made a special tunic for him.
1088	1	37	4	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated Joseph and were not able to speak to him kindly.
1089	1	37	5	¶Joseph had a dream, and when he told his brothers about it, they hated him even more.
1090	1	37	6	He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:
1091	1	37	7	There we were, binding sheaves of grain in the middle of the field. Suddenly my sheaf rose up and stood upright and your sheaves surrounded my sheaf and bowed down to it!”
1092	1	37	8	Then his brothers asked him, “Do you really think you will rule over us or have dominion over us?” They hated him even more because of his dream and because of what he said.
1093	1	37	9	¶Then he had another dream, and told it to his brothers. “Look,” he said. “I had another dream. The sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
1094	1	37	10	When he told his father and his brothers, his father rebuked him, saying, “What is this dream that you had? Will I, your mother, and your brothers really come and bow down to you?”
1095	1	37	11	His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept in mind what Joseph said.
1096	1	37	12	¶When his brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem,
1097	1	37	13	Israel said to Joseph, “Your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I will send you to them.” “I’m ready,” Joseph replied.
1098	1	37	14	So Jacob said to him, “Go now and check on the welfare of your brothers and of the flocks, and bring me word.” So Jacob sent him from the valley of Hebron.
1099	1	37	15	¶When Joseph reached Shechem, a man found him wandering in the field, so the man asked him, “What are you looking for?”
1100	1	37	16	He replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Please tell me where they are grazing their flocks.”
1101	1	37	17	The man said, “They left this area, for I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
1102	1	37	18	¶Now Joseph’s brothers saw him from a distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
1103	1	37	19	They said to one another, “Here comes this master of dreams!
1104	1	37	20	Come now, let’s kill him, throw him into one of the cisterns, and then say that a wild animal ate him. Then we’ll see how his dreams turn out!”
1105	1	37	21	¶When Reuben heard this, he rescued Joseph from their hands, saying, “Let’s not take his life!”
1106	1	37	22	Reuben continued, “Don’t shed blood! Throw him into this cistern that is here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him.” (Reuben said this so he could rescue Joseph from them and take him back to his father.)
1107	1	37	23	¶When Joseph reached his brothers, they stripped him of his tunic, the special tunic that he wore.
1108	1	37	24	Then they took him and threw him into the cistern. (Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.)
1109	1	37	25	¶When they sat down to eat their food, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying spices, balm, and myrrh down to Egypt.
1110	1	37	26	Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
1111	1	37	27	Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, but let’s not lay a hand on him, for after all, he is our brother, our own flesh.” His brothers agreed.
1112	1	37	28	So when the Midianite merchants passed by, Joseph’s brothers pulled him out of the cistern and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. The Ishmaelites then took Joseph to Egypt.
1113	1	37	29	¶Later Reuben returned to the cistern to find that Joseph was not in it! He tore his clothes,
1114	1	37	30	returned to his brothers, and said, “The boy isn’t there! And I, where can I go?”
1115	1	37	31	So they took Joseph’s tunic, killed a young goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood.
1116	1	37	32	Then they brought the special tunic to their father and said, “We found this. Determine now whether it is your son’s tunic or not.”
1117	1	37	33	¶He recognized it and exclaimed, “It is my son’s tunic! A wild animal has eaten him! Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!”
1118	1	37	34	Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned for his son many days.
1119	1	37	35	All his sons and daughters stood by him to console him, but he refused to be consoled. “No,” he said, “I will go to the grave mourning my son.” So Joseph’s father wept for him.
1120	1	37	36	¶Now in Egypt the Midianites sold Joseph to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard.
1121	1	38	1	¶At that time Judah left his brothers and stayed with an Adullamite man named Hirah.
1122	1	38	2	¶There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. Judah acquired her as a wife and slept with her.
1123	1	38	3	She became pregnant and had a son. Judah named him Er.
1124	1	38	4	She became pregnant again and had another son, whom she named Onan.
1125	1	38	5	Then she had yet another son, whom she named Shelah. She gave birth to him in Kezib.
1126	1	38	6	¶Judah acquired a wife for Er his firstborn; her name was Tamar.
1127	1	38	7	But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight, so the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> killed him.
1128	1	38	8	¶Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to her so that you may raise up a descendant for your brother.”
1129	1	38	9	But Onan knew that the child would not be considered his. So whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he wasted his emission on the ground so as not to give his brother a descendant.
1130	1	38	10	What he did was evil in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight, so the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> killed him too.
1131	1	38	11	¶Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s house until Shelah my son grows up.” For he thought, “I don’t want him to die like his brothers.” So Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.
1132	1	38	12	¶After some time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. After Judah was consoled, he left for Timnah to visit his sheepshearers, along with his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
1133	1	38	13	Tamar was told, “Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”
1134	1	38	14	So she removed her widow’s clothes and covered herself with a veil. She wrapped herself and sat at the entrance to Enaim which is on the way to Timnah. (She did this because she saw that she had not been given to Shelah as a wife, even though he had now grown up.)
1135	1	38	15	¶When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face.
1136	1	38	16	He turned aside to her along the road and said, “Come, please, I want to sleep with you.” (He did not realize it was his daughter-in-law.) She asked, “What will you give me so that you may sleep with me?”
1137	1	38	17	He replied, “I’ll send you a young goat from the flock.” She asked, “Will you give me a pledge until you send it?”
1138	1	38	18	He said, “What pledge should I give you?” She replied, “Your seal, your cord, and the staff that’s in your hand.” So he gave them to her, then slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.
1139	1	38	19	She left immediately, removed her veil, and put on her widow’s clothes.
1140	1	38	20	¶Then Judah had his friend Hirah the Adullamite take a young goat to get back from the woman the items he had given in pledge, but Hirah could not find her.
1141	1	38	21	He asked the men who were there, “Where is the cult prostitute who was at Enaim by the road?” But they replied, “There has been no cult prostitute here.”
1142	1	38	22	So he returned to Judah and said, “I couldn’t find her. Moreover, the men of the place said, ‘There has been no cult prostitute here.’”
1143	1	38	23	Judah said, “Let her keep the things for herself. Otherwise we will appear to be dishonest. I did indeed send this young goat, but you couldn’t find her.”
1144	1	38	24	¶After three months Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has turned to prostitution, and as a result she has become pregnant.” Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned!”
1145	1	38	25	While they were bringing her out, she sent word to her father-in-law: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong.” Then she said, “Identify the one to whom the seal, cord, and staff belong.”
1146	1	38	26	Judah recognized them and said, “She is more upright than I am, because I wouldn’t give her to Shelah my son.” He was not physically intimate with her again.
1147	1	38	27	¶When it was time for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb.
1148	1	38	28	While she was giving birth, one child put out his hand, and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his hand, saying, “This one came out first.”
1149	1	38	29	But then he drew back his hand, and his brother came out before him. She said, “How you have broken out of the womb!” So he was named Perez.
1150	1	38	30	Afterward his brother came out – the one who had the scarlet thread on his hand – and he was named Zerah.
1151	1	39	1	¶Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt. An Egyptian named Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh and the captain of the guard, purchased him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.
1152	1	39	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with Joseph. He was successful and lived in the household of his Egyptian master.
1153	1	39	3	His master observed that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with him and that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made everything he was doing successful.
1154	1	39	4	So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal attendant. Potiphar appointed Joseph overseer of his household and put him in charge of everything he owned.
1155	1	39	5	From the time Potiphar appointed him over his household and over all that he owned, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> blessed the Egyptian’s household for Joseph’s sake. The blessing of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was on everything that he had, both in his house and in his fields.
1156	1	39	6	So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph’s care; he gave no thought to anything except the food he ate. ¶Now Joseph was well built and good-looking.
1157	1	39	7	Soon after these things, his master’s wife took notice of Joseph and said, “Come to bed with me.”
1158	1	39	8	But he refused, saying to his master’s wife, “Look, my master does not give any thought to his household with me here, and everything that he owns he has put into my care.
1159	1	39	9	There is no one greater in this household than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife. So how could I do such a great evil and sin against God?”
1160	1	39	10	Even though she continued to speak to Joseph day after day, he did not respond to her invitation to go to bed with her.
1161	1	39	11	¶One day he went into the house to do his work when none of the household servants were there in the house.
1162	1	39	12	She grabbed him by his outer garment, saying, “Come to bed with me!” But he left his outer garment in her hand and ran outside.
1163	1	39	13	When she saw that he had left his outer garment in her hand and had run outside,
1164	1	39	14	she called for her household servants and said to them, “See, my husband brought in a Hebrew man to us to humiliate us. He tried to go to bed with me, but I screamed loudly.
1165	1	39	15	When he heard me raise my voice and scream, he left his outer garment beside me and ran outside.”
1166	1	39	16	¶So she laid his outer garment beside her until his master came home.
1167	1	39	17	This is what she said to him: “That Hebrew slave you brought to us tried to humiliate me,
1168	1	39	18	but when I raised my voice and screamed, he left his outer garment and ran outside.”
1169	1	39	19	¶When his master heard his wife say, “This is the way your slave treated me,” he became furious.
1170	1	39	20	Joseph’s master took him and threw him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. So he was there in the prison.
1171	1	39	21	¶But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with Joseph and showed him kindness. He granted him favor in the sight of the prison warden.
1172	1	39	22	The warden put all the prisoners under Joseph’s care. He was in charge of whatever they were doing.
1173	1	39	23	The warden did not concern himself with anything that was in Joseph’s care because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with him and whatever he was doing the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was making successful.
1174	1	40	1	¶After these things happened, the cupbearer to the king of Egypt and the royal baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.
1175	1	40	2	Pharaoh was enraged with his two officials, the cupbearer and the baker,
1176	1	40	3	so he imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard in the same facility where Joseph was confined.
1177	1	40	4	The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be their attendant, and he served them. ¶They spent some time in custody.
1178	1	40	5	Both of them, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, had a dream the same night. Each man’s dream had its own meaning.
1179	1	40	6	When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were looking depressed.
1180	1	40	7	So he asked Pharaoh’s officials, who were with him in custody in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?”
1181	1	40	8	They told him, “We both had dreams, but there is no one to interpret them.” Joseph responded, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me.”
1182	1	40	9	¶So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph: “In my dream, there was a vine in front of me.
1183	1	40	10	On the vine there were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes.
1184	1	40	11	Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, so I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and put the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”
1185	1	40	12	¶“This is its meaning,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches represent three days.
1186	1	40	13	In three more days Pharaoh will reinstate you and restore you to your office. You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you did before when you were cupbearer.
1187	1	40	14	But remember me when it goes well for you, and show me kindness. Make mention of me to Pharaoh and bring me out of this prison,
1188	1	40	15	for I really was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews and I have done nothing wrong here for which they should put me in a dungeon.”
1189	1	40	16	¶When the chief baker saw that the interpretation of the first dream was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also appeared in my dream and there were three baskets of white bread on my head.
1190	1	40	17	In the top basket there were baked goods of every kind for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them from the basket that was on my head.”
1191	1	40	18	¶Joseph replied, “This is its meaning: The three baskets represent three days.
1192	1	40	19	In three more days Pharaoh will decapitate you and impale you on a pole. Then the birds will eat your flesh from you.”
1193	1	40	20	¶On the third day it was Pharaoh’s birthday, so he gave a feast for all his servants. He “lifted up” the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker in the midst of his servants.
1194	1	40	21	He restored the chief cupbearer to his former position so that he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand,
1195	1	40	22	but the chief baker he impaled, just as Joseph had predicted.
1196	1	40	23	But the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph – he forgot him.
1197	1	41	1	¶At the end of two full years Pharaoh had a dream. As he was standing by the Nile,
1198	1	41	2	seven fine-looking, fat cows were coming up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the reeds.
1199	1	41	3	Then seven bad-looking, thin cows were coming up after them from the Nile, and they stood beside the other cows at the edge of the river.
1200	1	41	4	The bad-looking, thin cows ate the seven fine-looking, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
1201	1	41	5	¶Then he fell asleep again and had a second dream: There were seven heads of grain growing on one stalk, healthy and good.
1202	1	41	6	Then seven heads of grain, thin and burned by the east wind, were sprouting up after them.
1203	1	41	7	The thin heads swallowed up the seven healthy and full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up and realized it was a dream.
1204	1	41	8	¶In the morning he was troubled, so he called for all the diviner-priests of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
1205	1	41	9	Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I recall my failures.
1206	1	41	10	Pharaoh was enraged with his servants, and he put me in prison in the house of the captain of the guards – me and the chief baker.
1207	1	41	11	We each had a dream one night; each of us had a dream with its own meaning.
1208	1	41	12	Now a young man, a Hebrew, a servant of the captain of the guards, was with us there. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted the meaning of each of our respective dreams for us.
1209	1	41	13	It happened just as he had said to us – Pharaoh restored me to my office, but he impaled the baker.”
1210	1	41	14	¶Then Pharaoh summoned Joseph. So they brought him quickly out of the dungeon; he shaved himself, changed his clothes, and came before Pharaoh.
1211	1	41	15	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard about you, that you can interpret dreams.”
1212	1	41	16	Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “It is not within my power, but God will speak concerning the welfare of Pharaoh.”
1213	1	41	17	¶Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing by the edge of the Nile.
1214	1	41	18	Then seven fat and fine-looking cows were coming up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the reeds.
1215	1	41	19	Then seven other cows came up after them; they were scrawny, very bad-looking, and lean. I had never seen such bad-looking cows as these in all the land of Egypt!
1216	1	41	20	The lean, bad-looking cows ate up the seven fat cows.
1217	1	41	21	When they had eaten them, no one would have known that they had done so, for they were just as bad-looking as before. Then I woke up.
1218	1	41	22	I also saw in my dream seven heads of grain growing on one stalk, full and good.
1219	1	41	23	Then seven heads of grain, withered and thin and burned with the east wind, were sprouting up after them.
1220	1	41	24	The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. So I told all this to the diviner-priests, but no one could tell me its meaning.”
1221	1	41	25	¶Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Both dreams of Pharaoh have the same meaning. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
1222	1	41	26	The seven good cows represent seven years, and the seven good heads of grain represent seven years. Both dreams have the same meaning.
1223	1	41	27	The seven lean, bad-looking cows that came up after them represent seven years, as do the seven empty heads of grain burned with the east wind. They represent seven years of famine.
1224	1	41	28	This is just what I told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
1225	1	41	29	Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the whole land of Egypt.
1226	1	41	30	But seven years of famine will occur after them, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will devastate the land.
1227	1	41	31	The previous abundance of the land will not be remembered because of the famine that follows, for the famine will be very severe.
1228	1	41	32	The dream was repeated to Pharaoh because the matter has been decreed by God, and God will make it happen soon.
1229	1	41	33	¶“So now Pharaoh should look for a wise and discerning man and give him authority over all the land of Egypt.
1230	1	41	34	Pharaoh should do this – he should appoint officials throughout the land to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
1231	1	41	35	They should gather all the excess food during these good years that are coming. By Pharaoh’s authority they should store up grain so the cities will have food, and they should preserve it.
1232	1	41	36	This food should be held in storage for the land in preparation for the seven years of famine that will occur throughout the land of Egypt. In this way the land will survive the famine.”
1233	1	41	37	¶This advice made sense to Pharaoh and all his officials.
1234	1	41	38	So Pharaoh asked his officials, “Can we find a man like Joseph, one in whom the Spirit of God is present?”
1235	1	41	39	So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has enabled you to know all this, there is no one as wise and discerning as you are!
1236	1	41	40	You will oversee my household, and all my people will submit to your commands. Only I, the king, will be greater than you.
1237	1	41	41	¶“See here,” Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I place you in authority over all the land of Egypt.”
1238	1	41	42	Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his own hand and put it on Joseph’s. He clothed him with fine linen clothes and put a gold chain around his neck.
1239	1	41	43	Pharaoh had him ride in the chariot used by his second-in-command, and they cried out before him, “Kneel down!” So he placed him over all the land of Egypt.
1240	1	41	44	Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your permission no one will move his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.”
1241	1	41	45	Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah. He also gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. So Joseph took charge of all the land of Egypt.
1242	1	41	46	¶Now Joseph was 30 years old when he began serving Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph was commissioned by Pharaoh and was in charge of all the land of Egypt.
1243	1	41	47	During the seven years of abundance the land produced large, bountiful harvests.
1244	1	41	48	Joseph collected all the excess food in the land of Egypt during the seven years and stored it in the cities. In every city he put the food gathered from the fields around it.
1245	1	41	49	Joseph stored up a vast amount of grain, like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring it because it was impossible to measure.
1246	1	41	50	¶Two sons were born to Joseph before the famine came. Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, was their mother.
1247	1	41	51	Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, saying, “Certainly God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s house.”
1248	1	41	52	He named the second child Ephraim, saying, “Certainly God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.”
1249	1	41	53	¶The seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end.
1250	1	41	54	Then the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had predicted. There was famine in all the other lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food.
1251	1	41	55	When all the land of Egypt experienced the famine, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. Pharaoh said to all the people of Egypt, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.”
1252	1	41	56	¶While the famine was over all the earth, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians. The famine was severe throughout the land of Egypt.
1253	1	41	57	People from every country came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain because the famine was severe throughout the earth.
1254	1	42	1	¶When Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you looking at each other?”
1255	1	42	2	He then said, “Look, I hear that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy grain for us so that we may live and not die.”
1256	1	42	3	¶So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
1257	1	42	4	But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “What if some accident happens to him?”
1258	1	42	5	So Israel’s sons came to buy grain among the other travelers, for the famine was severe in the land of Canaan.
1259	1	42	6	¶Now Joseph was the ruler of the country, the one who sold grain to all the people of the country. Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.
1260	1	42	7	When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger to them and spoke to them harshly. He asked, “Where do you come from?” They answered, “From the land of Canaan, to buy grain for food.”
1261	1	42	8	¶Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
1262	1	42	9	Then Joseph remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them, and he said to them, “You are spies; you have come to see if our land is vulnerable!”
1263	1	42	10	¶But they exclaimed, “No, my lord! Your servants have come to buy grain for food!
1264	1	42	11	We are all the sons of one man; we are honest men! Your servants are not spies.”
1265	1	42	12	¶“No, ” he insisted, “but you have come to see if our land is vulnerable.”
1266	1	42	13	They replied, “Your servants are from a family of twelve brothers. We are the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is with our father at this time, and one is no longer alive.”
1267	1	42	14	¶But Joseph told them, “It is just as I said to you: You are spies!
1268	1	42	15	You will be tested in this way: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not depart from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
1269	1	42	16	One of you must go and get your brother, while the rest of you remain in prison. In this way your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If not, then, as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”
1270	1	42	17	He imprisoned them all for three days.
1271	1	42	18	On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do as I say and you will live, for I fear God.
1272	1	42	19	If you are honest men, leave one of your brothers confined here in prison while the rest of you go and take grain back for your hungry families.
1273	1	42	20	But you must bring your youngest brother to me. Then your words will be verified and you will not die.” They did as he said.
1274	1	42	21	¶They said to one another, “Surely we’re being punished because of our brother, because we saw how distressed he was when he cried to us for mercy, but we refused to listen. That is why this distress has come on us!”
1275	1	42	22	Reuben said to them, “Didn’t I say to you, ‘Don’t sin against the boy,’ but you wouldn’t listen? So now we must pay for shedding his blood!”
1276	1	42	23	(Now they did not know that Joseph could understand them, for he was speaking through an interpreter.)
1277	1	42	24	He turned away from them and wept. When he turned around and spoke to them again, he had Simeon taken from them and tied up before their eyes.
1278	1	42	25	¶Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man’s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. His orders were carried out.
1279	1	42	26	So they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
1280	1	42	27	¶When one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey at their resting place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack.
1281	1	42	28	He said to his brothers, “My money was returned! Here it is in my sack!” They were dismayed; they turned trembling to one another and said, “What in the world has God done to us?”
1282	1	42	29	¶They returned to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan and told him all the things that had happened to them, saying,
1283	1	42	30	“The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and treated us as if we were spying on the land.
1284	1	42	31	But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies!
1285	1	42	32	We are from a family of twelve brothers; we are the sons of one father. One is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father at this time in the land of Canaan.’
1286	1	42	33	¶“Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘This is how I will find out if you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for your hungry households and go.
1287	1	42	34	But bring your youngest brother back to me so I will know that you are honest men and not spies. Then I will give your brother back to you and you may move about freely in the land.’”
1288	1	42	35	¶When they were emptying their sacks, there was each man’s bag of money in his sack! When they and their father saw the bags of money, they were afraid.
1289	1	42	36	Their father Jacob said to them, “You are making me childless! Joseph is gone. Simeon is gone. And now you want to take Benjamin! Everything is against me.”
1290	1	42	37	¶Then Reuben said to his father, “You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my care and I will bring him back to you.”
1291	1	42	38	But Jacob replied, “My son will not go down there with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. If an accident happens to him on the journey you have to make, then you will bring down my gray hair in sorrow to the grave.”
1292	1	43	1	¶Now the famine was severe in the land.
1293	1	43	2	When they finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Return, buy us a little more food.”
1294	1	43	3	¶But Judah said to him, “The man solemnly warned us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’
1295	1	43	4	If you send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy food for you.
1296	1	43	5	But if you will not send him, we won’t go down there because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’”
1297	1	43	6	¶Israel said, “Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had one more brother?”
1298	1	43	7	¶They replied, “The man questioned us thoroughly about ourselves and our family, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ So we answered him in this way. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”
1299	1	43	8	¶Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me and we will go immediately. Then we will live and not die – we and you and our little ones.
1300	1	43	9	I myself pledge security for him; you may hold me liable. If I do not bring him back to you and place him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.
1301	1	43	10	But if we had not delayed, we could have traveled there and back twice by now!”
1302	1	43	11	¶Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and take a gift down to the man – a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachios and almonds.
1303	1	43	12	Take double the money with you; you must take back the money that was returned in the mouths of your sacks – perhaps it was an oversight.
1304	1	43	13	Take your brother too, and go right away to the man.
1305	1	43	14	May the Sovereign God grant you mercy before the man so that he may release your other brother and Benjamin! As for me, if I lose my children I lose them.”
1306	1	43	15	¶So the men took these gifts, and they took double the money with them, along with Benjamin. Then they hurried down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
1307	1	43	16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the servant who was over his household, “Bring the men to the house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for the men will eat with me at noon.”
1308	1	43	17	The man did just as Joseph said; he brought the men into Joseph’s house.
1309	1	43	18	¶But the men were afraid when they were brought to Joseph’s house. They said, “We are being brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks last time. He wants to capture us, make us slaves, and take our donkeys!”
1310	1	43	19	So they approached the man who was in charge of Joseph’s household and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.
1311	1	43	20	They said, “My lord, we did indeed come down the first time to buy food.
1312	1	43	21	But when we came to the place where we spent the night, we opened our sacks and each of us found his money – the full amount – in the mouth of his sack. So we have returned it.
1313	1	43	22	We have brought additional money with us to buy food. We do not know who put the money in our sacks!”
1314	1	43	23	¶“Everything is fine,” the man in charge of Joseph’s household told them. “Don’t be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks. I had your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
1315	1	43	24	¶The servant in charge brought the men into Joseph’s house. He gave them water, and they washed their feet. Then he gave food to their donkeys.
1316	1	43	25	They got their gifts ready for Joseph’s arrival at noon, for they had heard that they were to have a meal there.
1317	1	43	26	¶When Joseph came home, they presented him with the gifts they had brought inside, and they bowed down to the ground before him.
1318	1	43	27	He asked them how they were doing. Then he said, “Is your aging father well, the one you spoke about? Is he still alive?”
1319	1	43	28	“Your servant our father is well,” they replied. “He is still alive.” They bowed down in humility.
1320	1	43	29	¶When Joseph looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, he said, “Is this your youngest brother, whom you told me about?” Then he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”
1321	1	43	30	Joseph hurried out, for he was overcome by affection for his brother and was at the point of tears. So he went to his room and wept there.
1322	1	43	31	¶Then he washed his face and came out. With composure he said, “Set out the food.”
1323	1	43	32	They set a place for him, a separate place for his brothers, and another for the Egyptians who were eating with him. (The Egyptians are not able to eat with Hebrews, for the Egyptians think it is disgusting to do so.)
1324	1	43	33	They sat before him, arranged by order of birth, beginning with the firstborn and ending with the youngest. The men looked at each other in astonishment.
1325	1	43	34	He gave them portions of the food set before him, but the portion for Benjamin was five times greater than the portions for any of the others. They drank with Joseph until they all became drunk.
1326	1	44	1	¶He instructed the servant who was over his household, “Fill the sacks of the men with as much food as they can carry and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack.
1327	1	44	2	Then put my cup – the silver cup – in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the money for his grain.” He did as Joseph instructed.
1328	1	44	3	¶When morning came, the men and their donkeys were sent off.
1329	1	44	4	They had not gone very far from the city when Joseph said to the servant who was over his household, “Pursue the men at once! When you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil?
1330	1	44	5	Doesn’t my master drink from this cup and use it for divination? You have done wrong!’”
1331	1	44	6	¶When the man overtook them, he spoke these words to them.
1332	1	44	7	They answered him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!
1333	1	44	8	Look, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. Why then would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?
1334	1	44	9	If one of us has it, he will die, and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves!”
1335	1	44	10	¶He replied, “You have suggested your own punishment! The one who has it will become my slave, but the rest of you will go free.”
1336	1	44	11	So each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
1337	1	44	12	Then the man searched. He began with the oldest and finished with the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin’s sack!
1338	1	44	13	They all tore their clothes! Then each man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.
1339	1	44	14	¶So Judah and his brothers came back to Joseph’s house. He was still there, and they threw themselves to the ground before him.
1340	1	44	15	Joseph said to them, “What did you think you were doing? Don’t you know that a man like me can find out things like this by divination?”
1341	1	44	16	¶Judah replied, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? How can we clear ourselves? God has exposed the sin of your servants! We are now my lord’s slaves, we and the one in whose possession the cup was found.”
1342	1	44	17	¶But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found will become my slave, but the rest of you may go back to your father in peace.”
1343	1	44	18	¶Then Judah approached him and said, “My lord, please allow your servant to speak a word with you. Please do not get angry with your servant, for you are just like Pharaoh.
1344	1	44	19	My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’
1345	1	44	20	We said to my lord, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young boy who was born when our father was old. The boy’s brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’
1346	1	44	21	¶“Then you told your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I can see him.’
1347	1	44	22	We said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he leaves his father, his father will die.’
1348	1	44	23	But you said to your servants, ‘If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you will not see my face again.’
1349	1	44	24	When we returned to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
1350	1	44	25	¶“Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy us a little food.’
1351	1	44	26	But we replied, ‘We cannot go down there. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go, for we won’t be permitted to see the man’s face if our youngest brother is not with us.’
1352	1	44	27	¶“Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife gave me two sons.
1353	1	44	28	The first disappeared and I said, “He has surely been torn to pieces.” I have not seen him since.
1354	1	44	29	If you take this one from me too and an accident happens to him, then you will bring down my gray hair in tragedy to the grave.’
1355	1	44	30	¶“So now, when I return to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us – his very life is bound up in his son’s life.
1356	1	44	31	When he sees the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father in sorrow to the grave.
1357	1	44	32	Indeed, your servant pledged security for the boy with my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I will bear the blame before my father all my life.’
1358	1	44	33	¶“So now, please let your servant remain as my lord’s slave instead of the boy. As for the boy, let him go back with his brothers.
1359	1	44	34	For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I couldn’t bear to see my father’s pain.”
1360	1	45	1	¶Joseph was no longer able to control himself before all his attendants, so he cried out, “Make everyone go out from my presence!” No one remained with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.
1361	1	45	2	He wept loudly; the Egyptians heard it and Pharaoh’s household heard about it.
1362	1	45	3	¶Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” His brothers could not answer him because they were dumbfounded before him.
1363	1	45	4	Joseph said to his brothers, “Come closer to me,” so they came near. Then he said, “I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.
1364	1	45	5	Now, do not be upset and do not be angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me ahead of you to preserve life!
1365	1	45	6	For these past two years there has been famine in the land and for five more years there will be neither plowing nor harvesting.
1366	1	45	7	God sent me ahead of you to preserve you on the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
1367	1	45	8	So now, it is not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me an adviser to Pharaoh, lord over all his household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
1368	1	45	9	Now go up to my father quickly and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not delay!
1369	1	45	10	You will live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me – you, your children, your grandchildren, your flocks, your herds, and everything you have.
1370	1	45	11	I will provide you with food there because there will be five more years of famine. Otherwise you would become poor – you, your household, and everyone who belongs to you.”’
1371	1	45	12	You and my brother Benjamin can certainly see with your own eyes that I really am the one who speaks to you.
1372	1	45	13	So tell my father about all my honor in Egypt and about everything you have seen. But bring my father down here quickly!”
1373	1	45	14	¶Then he threw himself on the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.
1374	1	45	15	He kissed all his brothers and wept over them. After this his brothers talked with him.
1375	1	45	16	¶Now it was reported in the household of Pharaoh, “Joseph’s brothers have arrived.” It pleased Pharaoh and his servants.
1376	1	45	17	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and go to the land of Canaan!
1377	1	45	18	Get your father and your households and come to me! Then I will give you the best land in Egypt and you will eat the best of the land.’
1378	1	45	19	You are also commanded to say, ‘Do this: Take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives. Bring your father and come.
1379	1	45	20	Don’t worry about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt will be yours.’”
1380	1	45	21	¶So the sons of Israel did as he said. Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had instructed, and he gave them provisions for the journey.
1381	1	45	22	He gave sets of clothes to each one of them, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of clothes.
1382	1	45	23	To his father he sent the following: ten donkeys loaded with the best products of Egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, food, and provisions for his father’s journey.
1383	1	45	24	Then he sent his brothers on their way and they left. He said to them, “As you travel don’t be overcome with fear.”
1384	1	45	25	¶So they went up from Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
1385	1	45	26	They told him, “Joseph is still alive and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!” Jacob was stunned, for he did not believe them.
1386	1	45	27	But when they related to him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to transport him, their father Jacob’s spirit revived.
1387	1	45	28	Then Israel said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I will go and see him before I die.”
1388	1	46	1	¶So Israel began his journey, taking with him all that he had. When he came to Beer Sheba he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
1389	1	46	2	God spoke to Israel in a vision during the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob!” He replied, “Here I am!”
1390	1	46	3	He said, “I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there.
1391	1	46	4	I will go down with you to Egypt and I myself will certainly bring you back from there. Joseph will close your eyes.”
1392	1	46	5	¶Then Jacob started out from Beer Sheba, and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob, their little children, and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent along to transport him.
1393	1	46	6	Jacob and all his descendants took their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and they went to Egypt.
1394	1	46	7	He brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons, his daughters and granddaughters – all his descendants.
1395	1	46	8	¶These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt – Jacob and his sons:‡Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob.
1396	1	46	9	‡The sons of Reuben:‡Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
1397	1	46	10	‡The sons of Simeon:‡Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, ‡and Shaul (the son of a Canaanite woman).
1398	1	46	11	‡The sons of Levi:‡Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1399	1	46	12	‡The sons of Judah:‡Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah‡(but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan).‡The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
1400	1	46	13	‡The sons of Issachar:‡Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron.
1401	1	46	14	‡The sons of Zebulun:‡Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
1402	1	46	15	‡These were the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, along with Dinah his daughter. His sons and daughters numbered thirty-three in all.
1403	1	46	16	‡The sons of Gad:‡Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
1404	1	46	17	‡The sons of Asher:‡Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister.‡The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malkiel.
1405	1	46	18	‡These were the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter. She bore these to Jacob, sixteen in all.
1406	1	46	19	‡The sons of Rachel the wife of Jacob: ‡Joseph and Benjamin.
1407	1	46	20	‡Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt. Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore them to him.
1408	1	46	21	‡The sons of Benjamin: ‡Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard.
1409	1	46	22	‡These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob, fourteen in all.
1410	1	46	23	‡The son of Dan: Hushim.
1411	1	46	24	‡The sons of Naphtali:‡Jahziel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
1412	1	46	25	‡These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter. She bore these to Jacob, seven in all.
1413	1	46	26	¶All the direct descendants of Jacob who went to Egypt with him were sixty-six in number. (This number does not include the wives of Jacob’s sons.)
1414	1	46	27	Counting the two sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, all the people of the household of Jacob who were in Egypt numbered seventy.
1415	1	46	28	¶Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph to accompany him to Goshen. So they came to the land of Goshen.
1416	1	46	29	Joseph harnessed his chariot and went up to meet his father Israel in Goshen. When he met him, he hugged his neck and wept on his neck for quite some time.
1417	1	46	30	¶Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.”
1418	1	46	31	Then Joseph said to his brothers and his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me.
1419	1	46	32	The men are shepherds; they take care of livestock. They have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’
1420	1	46	33	Pharaoh will summon you and say, ‘What is your occupation?’
1421	1	46	34	Tell him, ‘Your servants have taken care of cattle from our youth until now, both we and our fathers,’ so that you may live in the land of Goshen, for everyone who takes care of sheep is disgusting to the Egyptians.”
1422	1	47	1	¶Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father, my brothers, their flocks and herds, and all that they own have arrived from the land of ¶Canaan. They are now in the land of Goshen.”
1423	1	47	2	He took five of his brothers and introduced them to Pharaoh.
1424	1	47	3	¶Pharaoh said to Joseph’s brothers, “What is your occupation?” They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants take care of flocks, just as our ancestors did.”
1425	1	47	4	Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as temporary residents in the land. There is no pasture for your servants’ flocks because the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.”
1426	1	47	5	¶Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.
1427	1	47	6	The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best region of the land. They may live in the land of Goshen. If you know of any highly capable men among them, put them in charge of my livestock.”
1428	1	47	7	¶Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh. Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
1429	1	47	8	Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How long have you lived?”
1430	1	47	9	Jacob said to Pharaoh, “All the years of my travels are 130. All the years of my life have been few and painful; the years of my travels are not as long as those of my ancestors.”
1431	1	47	10	Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.
1432	1	47	11	¶So Joseph settled his father and his brothers. He gave them territory in the land of Egypt, in the best region of the land, the land of Rameses, just as Pharaoh had commanded.
1433	1	47	12	Joseph also provided food for his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household, according to the number of their little children.
1434	1	47	13	¶But there was no food in all the land because the famine was very severe; the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan wasted away because of the famine.
1435	1	47	14	Joseph collected all the money that could be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan as payment for the grain they were buying. Then Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s palace.
1436	1	47	15	When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was used up, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food! Why should we die before your very eyes because our money has run out?”
1437	1	47	16	¶Then Joseph said, “If your money is gone, bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.”
1438	1	47	17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for their horses, the livestock of their flocks and herds, and their donkeys. He got them through that year by giving them food in exchange for all their livestock.
1439	1	47	18	¶When that year was over, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We cannot hide from our lord that the money is used up and the livestock and the animals belong to our lord. Nothing remains before our lord except our bodies and our land.
1440	1	47	19	Why should we die before your very eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we, with our land, will become Pharaoh’s slaves. Give us seed that we may live and not die. Then the land will not become desolate.”
1441	1	47	20	¶So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. Each of the Egyptians sold his field, for the famine was severe. So the land became Pharaoh’s.
1442	1	47	21	Joseph made all the people slaves from one end of Egypt’s border to the other end of it.
1443	1	47	22	But he did not purchase the land of the priests because the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh and they ate from their allotment that Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.
1444	1	47	23	¶Joseph said to the people, “Since I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you. Cultivate the land.
1445	1	47	24	When the crop comes in, give one-fifth of it to Pharaoh. The remaining four-fifths will be yours for seed for the fields and for you to eat, including those in your households and your little children.”
1446	1	47	25	They replied, “You have saved our lives! You are showing us favor, and we will be Pharaoh’s slaves.”
1447	1	47	26	¶So Joseph made it a statute, which is in effect to this day throughout the land of Egypt: One-fifth belongs to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh’s.
1448	1	47	27	¶Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they owned land there. They were fruitful and increased rapidly in number.
1449	1	47	28	¶Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; the years of Jacob’s life were 147 in all.
1450	1	47	29	The time for Israel to die approached, so he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,
1451	1	47	30	but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” Joseph said, “I will do as you say.”
1452	1	47	31	¶Jacob said, “Swear to me that you will do so.” So Joseph gave him his word. Then Israel bowed down at the head of his bed.
1453	1	48	1	¶After these things Joseph was told, “Your father is weakening.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him.
1454	1	48	2	When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has just come to you,” Israel regained strength and sat up on his bed.
1455	1	48	3	Jacob said to Joseph, “The Sovereign God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me.
1456	1	48	4	He said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and will multiply you. I will make you into a group of nations, and I will give this land to your descendants as an everlasting possession.’
1457	1	48	5	¶“Now, as for your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, they will be mine. Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine just as Reuben and Simeon are.
1458	1	48	6	Any children that you father after them will be yours; they will be listed under the names of their brothers in their inheritance.
1459	1	48	7	But as for me, when I was returning from Paddan, Rachel died – to my sorrow – in the land of Canaan. It happened along the way, some distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there on the way to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem).
1460	1	48	8	¶When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he asked, “Who are these?”
1461	1	48	9	Joseph said to his father, “They are the sons God has given me in this place.” His father said, “Bring them to me so I may bless them.”
1462	1	48	10	Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of his age; he was not able to see well. So Joseph brought his sons near to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.
1463	1	48	11	Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see you again, but now God has allowed me to see your children too.”
1464	1	48	12	¶So Joseph moved them from Israel’s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.
1465	1	48	13	Joseph positioned them; he put Ephraim on his right hand across from Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh on his left hand across from Israel’s right hand. Then Joseph brought them closer to his father.
1466	1	48	14	Israel stretched out his right hand and placed it on Ephraim’s head, although he was the younger. Crossing his hands, he put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, for Manasseh was the firstborn.
1467	1	48	15	‡Then he blessed Joseph and said, ‡“May the God before whom my fathers ‡Abraham and Isaac walked – ‡the God who has been my shepherd ‡all my life long to this day,
1468	1	48	16	‡the Angel who has protected me ‡from all harm – ‡bless these boys.‡May my name be named in them, ‡and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.‡May they grow into a multitude on the earth.”
1469	1	48	17	¶When Joseph saw that his father placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head, it displeased him. So he took his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.
1470	1	48	18	Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”
1471	1	48	19	¶But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a nation and he too will become great. In spite of this, his younger brother will be even greater and his descendants will become a multitude of nations.”
1472	1	48	20	So he blessed them that day, saying, ‡“By you will Israel bless, saying,‡‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’”¶So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
1473	1	48	21	¶Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers.
1474	1	48	22	As one who is above your brothers, I give to you the mountain slope, which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.”
1475	1	49	1	¶Jacob called for his sons and said, “Gather together so I can tell you what will happen to you in the future.
1476	1	49	2	‡“Assemble and listen, you sons of Jacob;‡listen to Israel, your father.
1477	1	49	3	‡Reuben, you are my firstborn,‡my might and the beginning of my strength,‡outstanding in dignity, outstanding in power.
1478	1	49	4	‡You are destructive like water and will not excel, ‡for you got on your father’s bed, ‡then you defiled it – he got on my couch!
1479	1	49	5	‡Simeon and Levi are brothers,‡weapons of violence are their knives!
1480	1	49	6	‡O my soul, do not come into their council,‡do not be united to their assembly, my heart, ‡for in their anger they have killed men,‡and for pleasure they have hamstrung oxen.
1481	1	49	7	‡Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce,‡and their fury, for it was cruel.‡I will divide them in Jacob,‡and scatter them in Israel!
1482	1	49	8	‡Judah, your brothers will praise you.‡Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies,‡your father’s sons will bow down before you.
1483	1	49	9	‡You are a lion’s cub, Judah,‡from the prey, my son, you have gone up.‡He crouches and lies down like a lion;‡like a lioness – who will rouse him?
1484	1	49	10	‡The scepter will not depart from Judah,‡nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, ‡until he comes to whom it belongs; ‡the nations will obey him.
1485	1	49	11	‡Binding his foal to the vine,‡and his colt to the choicest vine,‡he will wash his garments in wine,‡his robes in the blood of grapes.
1486	1	49	12	‡His eyes will be red from wine,‡and his teeth white from milk.
1487	1	49	13	‡Zebulun will live by the haven of the sea‡and become a haven for ships;‡his border will extend to Sidon.
1488	1	49	14	‡Issachar is a strong-boned donkey‡lying down between two saddlebags.
1489	1	49	15	‡When he sees a good resting place, ‡and the pleasant land,‡he will bend his shoulder to the burden‡and become a slave laborer.
1490	1	49	16	‡Dan will judge his people‡as one of the tribes of Israel.
1491	1	49	17	‡May Dan be a snake beside the road,‡a viper by the path,‡that bites the heels of the horse‡so that its rider falls backward.
1492	1	49	18	‡I wait for your deliverance, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
1493	1	49	19	‡Gad will be raided by marauding bands,‡but he will attack them at their heels.
1494	1	49	20	‡Asher’s food will be rich, ‡and he will provide delicacies to royalty.
1495	1	49	21	‡Naphtali is a free running doe, ‡he speaks delightful words.
1496	1	49	22	‡Joseph is a fruitful bough, ‡a fruitful bough near a spring‡whose branches climb over the wall.
1497	1	49	23	‡The archers will attack him, ‡they will shoot at him and oppose him.
1498	1	49	24	‡But his bow will remain steady,‡and his hands will be skillful;‡because of the hands of the Powerful One of Jacob,‡because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
1499	1	49	25	‡because of the God of your father, ‡who will help you, ‡because of the Sovereign God, ‡who will bless you ‡with blessings from the sky above,‡blessings from the deep that lies below,‡and blessings of the breasts and womb.
1500	1	49	26	‡The blessings of your father are greater ‡than the blessings of the eternal mountains ‡or the desirable things of the age-old hills.‡They will be on the head of Joseph‡and on the brow of the prince of his brothers.
1501	1	49	27	‡Benjamin is a ravenous wolf;‡in the morning devouring the prey,‡and in the evening dividing the plunder.”
1502	1	49	28	¶These are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is what their father said to them when he blessed them. He gave each of them an appropriate blessing.
1503	1	49	29	¶Then he instructed them, “I am about to go to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
1504	1	49	30	It is the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought for a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite.
1505	1	49	31	There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah; there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah; and there I buried Leah.
1506	1	49	32	The field and the cave in it were acquired from the sons of Heth.”
1507	1	49	33	¶When Jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons, he pulled his feet up onto the bed, breathed his last breath, and went to his people.
1508	1	50	1	¶Then Joseph hugged his father’s face. He wept over him and kissed him.
1509	1	50	2	Joseph instructed the physicians in his service to embalm his father, so the physicians embalmed Israel.
1510	1	50	3	They took forty days, for that is the full time needed for embalming. The Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
1511	1	50	4	¶When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s royal court, “If I have found favor in your sight, please say to Pharaoh,
1512	1	50	5	‘My father made me swear an oath. He said, “I am about to die. Bury me in my tomb that I dug for myself there in the land of Canaan.” Now let me go and bury my father; then I will return.’”
1513	1	50	6	So Pharaoh said, “Go and bury your father, just as he made you swear to do.”
1514	1	50	7	¶So Joseph went up to bury his father; all Pharaoh’s officials went with him – the senior courtiers of his household, all the senior officials of the land of Egypt,
1515	1	50	8	all Joseph’s household, his brothers, and his father’s household. But they left their little children and their flocks and herds in the land of Goshen.
1516	1	50	9	Chariots and horsemen also went up with him, so it was a very large entourage.
1517	1	50	10	¶When they came to the threshing floor of Atad on the other side of the Jordan, they mourned there with very great and bitter sorrow. There Joseph observed a seven day period of mourning for his father.
1518	1	50	11	When the Canaanites who lived in the land saw them mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a very sad occasion for the Egyptians.” That is why its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
1519	1	50	12	¶So the sons of Jacob did for him just as he had instructed them.
1520	1	50	13	His sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, near Mamre. This is the field Abraham purchased as a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite.
1521	1	50	14	After he buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, along with his brothers and all who had accompanied him to bury his father.
1522	1	50	15	¶When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph bears a grudge and wants to repay us in full for all the harm we did to him?”
1523	1	50	16	So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave these instructions before he died:
1524	1	50	17	‘Tell Joseph this: Please forgive the sin of your brothers and the wrong they did when they treated you so badly.’ Now please forgive the sin of the servants of the God of your father.” When this message was reported to him, Joseph wept.
1525	1	50	18	Then his brothers also came and threw themselves down before him; they said, “Here we are; we are your slaves.”
1526	1	50	19	But Joseph answered them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
1527	1	50	20	As for you, you meant to harm me, but God intended it for a good purpose, so he could preserve the lives of many people, as you can see this day.
1528	1	50	21	So now, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your little children.” Then he consoled them and spoke kindly to them.
1529	1	50	22	¶Joseph lived in Egypt, along with his father’s family. Joseph lived 110 years.
1530	1	50	23	Joseph saw the descendants of Ephraim to the third generation. He also saw the children of Makir the son of Manasseh; they were given special inheritance rights by Joseph.
1531	1	50	24	¶Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to you and lead you up from this land to the land he swore on oath to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
1532	1	50	25	Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath. He said, “God will surely come to you. Then you must carry my bones up from this place.”
1533	1	50	26	So Joseph died at the age of 110. After they embalmed him, his body was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
1534	2	1	1	¶These are the names of the sons of Israel who entered Egypt – each man with his household entered with Jacob:
1535	2	1	2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
1536	2	1	3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
1537	2	1	4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
1538	2	1	5	All the people who were directly descended from Jacob numbered seventy. But Joseph was already in Egypt,
1539	2	1	6	and in time Joseph and his brothers and all that generation died.
1540	2	1	7	The Israelites, however, were fruitful, increased greatly, multiplied, and became extremely strong, so that the land was filled with them.
1541	2	1	8	¶Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power over Egypt.
1542	2	1	9	He said to his people, “Look at the Israelite people, more numerous and stronger than we are!
1543	2	1	10	Come, let’s deal wisely with them. Otherwise they will continue to multiply, and if a war breaks out, they will ally themselves with our enemies and fight against us and leave the country.”
1544	2	1	11	¶So they put foremen over the Israelites to oppress them with hard labor. As a result they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
1545	2	1	12	But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread. As a result the Egyptians loathed the Israelites,
1546	2	1	13	and they made the Israelites serve rigorously.
1547	2	1	14	They made their lives bitter by hard service with mortar and bricks and by all kinds of service in the fields. Every kind of service the Israelites were required to give was rigorous.
1548	2	1	15	¶The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,
1549	2	1	16	“When you assist the Hebrew women in childbirth, observe at the delivery: If it is a son, kill him, but if it is a daughter, she may live.”
1550	2	1	17	But the midwives feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them; they let the boys live.
1551	2	1	18	¶Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this and let the boys live?”
1552	2	1	19	The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women – for the Hebrew women are vigorous; they give birth before the midwife gets to them!”
1553	2	1	20	So God treated the midwives well, and the people multiplied and became very strong.
1554	2	1	21	And because the midwives feared God, he made households for them.
1555	2	1	22	¶Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, “All sons that are born you must throw into the river, but all daughters you may let live.”
1556	2	2	1	¶A man from the household of Levi married a woman who was a descendant of Levi.
1557	2	2	2	The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a healthy child, she hid him for three months.
1558	2	2	3	But when she was no longer able to hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him and sealed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and set it among the reeds along the edge of the Nile.
1559	2	2	4	His sister stationed herself at a distance to find out what would happen to him.
1560	2	2	5	¶Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself by the Nile, while her attendants were walking alongside the river, and she saw the basket among the reeds. She sent one of her attendants, took it,
1561	2	2	6	opened it, and saw the child – a boy, crying! – and she felt compassion for him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”
1562	2	2	7	¶Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get a nursing woman for you from the Hebrews, so that she may nurse the child for you?”
1563	2	2	8	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Yes, do so.” So the young girl went and got the child’s mother.
1564	2	2	9	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.
1565	2	2	10	¶When the child grew older she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, “Because I drew him from the water.”
1566	2	2	11	¶In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and observed their hard labor, and he saw an Egyptian man attacking a Hebrew man, one of his own people.
1567	2	2	12	He looked this way and that and saw that no one was there, and then he attacked the Egyptian and concealed the body in the sand.
1568	2	2	13	When he went out the next day, there were two Hebrew men fighting. So he said to the one who was in the wrong, “Why are you attacking your fellow Hebrew?”
1569	2	2	14	¶The man replied, “Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Are you planning to kill me like you killed that Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid, thinking, “Surely what I did has become known.”
1570	2	2	15	When Pharaoh heard about this event, he sought to kill Moses. So Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, and he settled by a certain well.
1571	2	2	16	¶Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and began to draw water and fill the troughs in order to water their father’s flock.
1572	2	2	17	When some shepherds came and drove them away, Moses came up and defended them and then watered their flock.
1573	2	2	18	So when they came home to their father Reuel, he asked, “Why have you come home so early today?”
1574	2	2	19	They said, “An Egyptian man rescued us from the shepherds, and he actually drew water for us and watered the flock!”
1575	2	2	20	He said to his daughters, “So where is he? Why in the world did you leave the man? Call him, so that he may eat a meal with us.”
1576	2	2	21	¶Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.
1577	2	2	22	When she bore a son, Moses named him Gershom, for he said, “I have become a resident foreigner in a foreign land.”
1578	2	2	23	¶During that long period of time the king of Egypt died, and the Israelites groaned because of the slave labor. They cried out, and their desperate cry because of their slave labor went up to God.
1579	2	2	24	God heard their groaning, God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob,
1580	2	2	25	God saw the Israelites, and God understood.
1581	2	3	1	¶Now Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.
1582	2	3	2	The angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to him in a flame of fire from within a bush. He looked – and the bush was ablaze with fire, but it was not being consumed!
1583	2	3	3	So Moses thought, “I will turn aside to see this amazing sight. Why does the bush not burn up?”
1584	2	3	4	When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him from within the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” And Moses said, “Here I am.”
1585	2	3	5	God said, “Do not approach any closer! Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”
1586	2	3	6	He added, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.
1587	2	3	7	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt. I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.
1588	2	3	8	I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a land that is both good and spacious, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the region of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
1589	2	3	9	And now indeed the cry of the Israelites has come to me, and I have also seen how severely the Egyptians oppress them.
1590	2	3	10	So now go, and I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”
1591	2	3	11	¶Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, or that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
1592	2	3	12	He replied, “Surely I will be with you, and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you bring the people out of Egypt, you and they will serve God at this mountain.”
1593	2	3	13	¶Moses said to God, “If I go to the Israelites and tell them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ – what should I say to them?”
1594	2	3	14	¶God said to Moses, “<span class=\"smcaps\">I am</span> that <span class=\"smcaps\">I am</span>.” And he said, “You must say this to the Israelites, ‘<span class=\"smcaps\">I am</span> has sent me to you.’”
1595	2	3	15	God also said to Moses, “You must say this to the Israelites, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob – has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial from generation to generation.’
1596	2	3	16	¶“Go and bring together the elders of Israel and tell them, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of your fathers, appeared to me – the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – saying, “I have attended carefully to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt,
1597	2	3	17	and I have promised that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’
1598	2	3	18	¶“The elders will listen to you, and then you and the elders of Israel must go to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now, let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.’
1599	2	3	19	But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, not even under force.
1600	2	3	20	So I will extend my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders that I will do among them, and after that he will release you.
1601	2	3	21	¶“I will grant this people favor with the Egyptians, so that when you depart you will not leave empty-handed.
1602	2	3	22	Every woman will ask her neighbor and the one who happens to be staying in her house for items of silver and gold and for clothing. You will put these articles on your sons and daughters – thus you will plunder Egypt!”
1603	2	4	1	¶Moses answered again, “And if they do not believe me or pay attention to me, but say, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not appeared to you’?”
1604	2	4	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A staff.”
1605	2	4	3	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Throw it to the ground.” So he threw it to the ground, and it became a snake, and Moses ran from it.
1606	2	4	4	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Put out your hand and grab it by the tail” – so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand –
1607	2	4	5	“that they may believe that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”
1608	2	4	6	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> also said to him, “Put your hand into your robe.” So he put his hand into his robe, and when he brought it out – there was his hand, leprous like snow!
1609	2	4	7	He said, “Put your hand back into your robe.” So he put his hand back into his robe, and when he brought it out from his robe – there it was, restored like the rest of his skin!
1610	2	4	8	“If they do not believe you or pay attention to the former sign, then they may believe the latter sign.
1611	2	4	9	And if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to you, then take some water from the Nile and pour it out on the dry ground. The water you take out of the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”
1612	2	4	10	¶Then Moses said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “O my Lord, I am not an eloquent man, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant, for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.”
1613	2	4	11	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Who gave a mouth to man, or who makes a person mute or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?
1614	2	4	12	So now go, and I will be with your mouth and will teach you what you must say.”
1615	2	4	13	¶But Moses said, “O my Lord, please send anyone else whom you wish to send!”
1616	2	4	14	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> became angry with Moses, and he said, “What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he can speak very well. Moreover, he is coming to meet you, and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart.
1617	2	4	15	¶“So you are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And as for me, I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you both what you must do.
1618	2	4	16	He will speak for you to the people, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were his God.
1619	2	4	17	You will also take in your hand this staff, with which you will do the signs.”
1620	2	4	18	¶So Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Let me go, so that I may return to my relatives in Egypt and see if they are still alive.” Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”
1621	2	4	19	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, because all the men who were seeking your life are dead.”
1622	2	4	20	Then Moses took his wife and sons and put them on a donkey and headed back to the land of Egypt, and Moses took the staff of God in his hand.
1623	2	4	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders I have put under your control. But I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.
1624	2	4	22	You must say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, “Israel is my son, my firstborn,
1625	2	4	23	and I said to you, ‘Let my son go that he may serve me,’ but since you have refused to let him go, I will surely kill your son, your firstborn!”’”
1626	2	4	24	¶Now on the way, at a place where they stopped for the night, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> met Moses and sought to kill him.
1627	2	4	25	But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off the foreskin of her son and touched it to Moses’ feet, and said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”
1628	2	4	26	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> let him alone. (At that time she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” referring to the circumcision.)
1629	2	4	27	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Aaron, “Go to the wilderness to meet Moses. So he went and met him at the mountain of God and greeted him with a kiss.
1630	2	4	28	Moses told Aaron all the words of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who had sent him and all the signs that he had commanded him.
1631	2	4	29	Then Moses and Aaron went and brought together all the Israelite elders.
1632	2	4	30	Aaron spoke all the words that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people,
1633	2	4	31	and the people believed. When they heard that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had attended to the Israelites and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed down close to the ground.
1634	2	5	1	¶Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Release my people so that they may hold a pilgrim feast to me in the wilderness.’”
1635	2	5	2	But Pharaoh said, “Who is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that I should obey him by releasing Israel? I do not know the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and I will not release Israel!”
1636	2	5	3	And they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go a three-day journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, so that he does not strike us with plague or the sword.”
1637	2	5	4	The king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you cause the people to refrain from their work? Return to your labor!”
1638	2	5	5	Pharaoh was thinking, “The people of the land are now many, and you are giving them rest from their labor.”
1639	2	5	6	¶That same day Pharaoh commanded the slave masters and foremen who were over the people:
1640	2	5	7	“You must no longer give straw to the people for making bricks as before. Let them go and collect straw for themselves.
1641	2	5	8	But you must require of them the same quota of bricks that they were making before. Do not reduce it, for they are slackers. That is why they are crying, ‘Let us go sacrifice to our God.’
1642	2	5	9	Make the work harder for the men so they will keep at it and pay no attention to lying words!”
1643	2	5	10	¶So the slave masters of the people and their foremen went to the Israelites and said, “Thus says Pharaoh: ‘I am not giving you straw.
1644	2	5	11	You go get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, because there will be no reduction at all in your workload.’”
1645	2	5	12	So the people spread out through all the land of Egypt to collect stubble for straw.
1646	2	5	13	The slave masters were pressuring them, saying, “Complete your work for each day, just like when there was straw!”
1647	2	5	14	The Israelite foremen whom Pharaoh’s slave masters had set over them were beaten and were asked, “Why did you not complete your requirement for brickmaking as in the past – both yesterday and today?”
1648	2	5	15	¶The Israelite foremen went and cried out to Pharaoh, “Why are you treating your servants this way?
1649	2	5	16	No straw is given to your servants, but we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are even being beaten, but the fault is with your people.”
1650	2	5	17	¶But Pharaoh replied, “You are slackers! Slackers! That is why you are saying, ‘Let us go sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
1651	2	5	18	So now, get back to work! You will not be given straw, but you must still produce your quota of bricks!”
1652	2	5	19	The Israelite foremen saw that they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce the daily quota of your bricks.”
1653	2	5	20	¶When they went out from Pharaoh, they encountered Moses and Aaron standing there to meet them,
1654	2	5	21	and they said to them, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the opinion of Pharaoh and his servants, so that you have given them an excuse to kill us!”
1655	2	5	22	¶Moses returned to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and said, “Lord, why have you caused trouble for this people? Why did you ever send me?
1656	2	5	23	From the time I went to speak to Pharaoh in your name, he has caused trouble for this people, and you have certainly not rescued them!”
1657	2	6	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for compelled by my strong hand he will release them, and by my strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”
1658	2	6	2	¶God spoke to Moses and said to him, “I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
1659	2	6	3	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name ‘the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span> I was not known to them.
1660	2	6	4	I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they were living as resident foreigners.
1661	2	6	5	I have also heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.
1662	2	6	6	Therefore, tell the Israelites, ‘I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. I will bring you out from your enslavement to the Egyptians, I will rescue you from the hard labor they impose, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.
1663	2	6	7	I will take you to myself for a people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out from your enslavement to the Egyptians.
1664	2	6	8	I will bring you to the land I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob – and I will give it to you as a possession. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>’”
1665	2	6	9	¶Moses told this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and hard labor.
1666	2	6	10	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses,
1667	2	6	11	“Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt that he must release the Israelites from his land.”
1668	2	6	12	But Moses replied to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “If the Israelites did not listen to me, then how will Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with difficulty?”
1669	2	6	13	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge for the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.
1670	2	6	14	¶These are the heads of their fathers’ households: ¶The sons of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel, were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.
1671	2	6	15	¶The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.
1672	2	6	16	¶Now these are the names of the sons of Levi, according to their records: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. (The length of Levi’s life was 137 years.)
1673	2	6	17	¶The sons of Gershon, by their families, were Libni and Shimei.
1674	2	6	18	¶The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. (The length of Kohath’s life was 133 years.)
1675	2	6	19	¶The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi, according to their records.
1676	2	6	20	¶Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. (The length of Amram’s life was 137 years.)
1677	2	6	21	¶The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zikri.
1678	2	6	22	¶The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
1679	2	6	23	¶Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
1680	2	6	24	¶The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans.
1681	2	6	25	¶Now Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel and she bore him Phinehas.¶These are the heads of the fathers’ households of Levi according to their clans.
1682	2	6	26	¶It was the same Aaron and Moses to whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their regiments.”
1683	2	6	27	They were the men who were speaking to Pharaoh king of Egypt, in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. It was the same Moses and Aaron.
1684	2	6	28	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
1685	2	6	29	he said to him, “I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I am telling you.”
1686	2	6	30	But Moses said before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Since I speak with difficulty, why should Pharaoh listen to me?”
1687	2	7	1	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
1688	2	7	2	You are to speak everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh that he must release the Israelites from his land.
1689	2	7	3	But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and although I will multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt,
1690	2	7	4	Pharaoh will not listen to you. I will reach into Egypt and bring out my regiments, my people the Israelites, from the land of Egypt with great acts of judgment.
1691	2	7	5	Then the Egyptians will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord, </span>when I extend my hand over Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.
1692	2	7	6	¶And Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded them.
1693	2	7	7	Now Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.
1694	2	7	8	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron,
1695	2	7	9	“When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Do a miracle,’ and you say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ it will become a snake.”
1696	2	7	10	When Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, they did so, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded them – Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants and it became a snake.
1697	2	7	11	Then Pharaoh also summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the magicians of Egypt by their secret arts did the same thing.
1698	2	7	12	Each man threw down his staff, and the staffs became snakes. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.
1699	2	7	13	Yet Pharaoh’s heart became hard, and he did not listen to them, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had predicted.
1700	2	7	14	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is hard; he refuses to release the people.
1701	2	7	15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning when he goes out to the water. Position yourself to meet him by the edge of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was turned into a snake.
1702	2	7	16	Tell him, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you to say, “Release my people, that they may serve me in the wilderness!” But until now you have not listened.
1703	2	7	17	This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said:“By this you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: I am going to strike the water of the Nile with the staff that is in my hand, and it will be turned into blood.
1704	2	7	18	Fish in the Nile will die, the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile.”’”
1705	2	7	19	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over Egypt’s waters – over their rivers, over their canals, over their ponds, and over all their reservoirs – so that it becomes blood.’ There will be blood everywhere in the land of Egypt, even in wooden and stone containers.”
1706	2	7	20	Moses and Aaron did so, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded. He raised the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile right before the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood.
1707	2	7	21	When the fish that were in the Nile died, the Nile began to stink, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. There was blood everywhere in the land of Egypt!
1708	2	7	22	But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts, and so Pharaoh’s heart remained hard, and he refused to listen to Moses and Aaron – just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had predicted.
1709	2	7	23	And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. He did not pay any attention to this.
1710	2	7	24	All the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the Nile.
1711	2	7	25	¶Seven full days passed after the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> struck the Nile.
1712	2	8	1	(7:26) Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: “Release my people in order that they may serve me!
1713	2	8	2	But if you refuse to release them, then I am going to plague all your territory with frogs.
1714	2	8	3	The Nile will swarm with frogs, and they will come up and go into your house, in your bedroom, and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and your kneading troughs.
1715	2	8	4	Frogs will come up against you, your people, and all your servants.”’”
1716	2	8	5	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Extend your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals, and over the ponds, and bring the frogs up over the land of Egypt.’”
1717	2	8	6	So Aaron extended his hand over the waters of Egypt, and frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
1718	2	8	7	¶The magicians did the same with their secret arts and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt too.
1719	2	8	8	¶Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that he may take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will release the people that they may sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
1720	2	8	9	Moses said to Pharaoh, “You may have the honor over me – when shall I pray for you, your servants, and your people, for the frogs to be removed from you and your houses, so that they will be left only in the Nile?”
1721	2	8	10	He said, “Tomorrow.” And Moses said, “It will be as you say, so that you may know that there is no one like the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.
1722	2	8	11	The frogs will depart from you, your houses, your servants, and your people; they will be left only in the Nile.”
1723	2	8	12	¶Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> because of the frogs that he had brought on Pharaoh.
1724	2	8	13	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did as Moses asked – the frogs died out of the houses, the villages, and the fields.
1725	2	8	14	The Egyptians piled them in countless heaps, and the land stank.
1726	2	8	15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had predicted.
1727	2	8	16	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Extend your staff and strike the dust of the ground, and it will become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.’”
1728	2	8	17	They did so; Aaron extended his hand with his staff, he struck the dust of the ground, and it became gnats on people and on animals. All the dust of the ground became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.
1729	2	8	18	When the magicians attempted to bring forth gnats by their secret arts, they could not. So there were gnats on people and on animals.
1730	2	8	19	The magicians said to Pharaoh, “It is the finger of God!” But Pharaoh’s heart remained hard, and he did not listen to them, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had predicted.
1731	2	8	20	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and position yourself before Pharaoh as he goes out to the water, and tell him, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, “Release my people that they may serve me!
1732	2	8	21	If you do not release my people, then I am going to send swarms of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and in your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the ground they stand on.
1733	2	8	22	But on that day I will mark off the land of Goshen, where my people are staying, so that no swarms of flies will be there, that you may know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the midst of this land.
1734	2	8	23	I will put a division between my people and your people. This sign will take place tomorrow.”’”
1735	2	8	24	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did so; a thick swarm of flies came into Pharaoh’s house and into the houses of his servants, and throughout the whole land of Egypt the land was ruined because of the swarms of flies.
1736	2	8	25	¶Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.”
1737	2	8	26	But Moses said, “That would not be the right thing to do, for the sacrifices we make to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God would be an abomination to the Egyptians. If we make sacrifices that are an abomination to the Egyptians right before their eyes, will they not stone us?
1738	2	8	27	We must go on a three-day journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, just as he is telling us.”
1739	2	8	28	¶Pharaoh said, “I will release you so that you may sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in the wilderness. Only you must not go very far. Do pray for me.”
1740	2	8	29	¶Moses said, “I am going to go out from you and pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the swarms of flies will go away from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow. Only do not let Pharaoh deal falsely again by not releasing the people to sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
1741	2	8	30	So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span>
1742	2	8	31	and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did as Moses asked – he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained!
1743	2	8	32	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and did not release the people.
1744	2	9	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> the God of the Hebrews, has said, “Release my people that they may serve me!
1745	2	9	2	For if you refuse to release them and continue holding them,
1746	2	9	3	then the hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will surely bring a very terrible plague on your livestock in the field, on the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks.
1747	2	9	4	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will distinguish between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and nothing will die of all that the Israelites have.”’”
1748	2	9	5	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> set an appointed time, saying, “Tomorrow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will do this in the land.”
1749	2	9	6	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did this on the next day; all the livestock of the Egyptians died, but of the Israelites’ livestock not one died.
1750	2	9	7	Pharaoh sent representatives to investigate, and indeed, not even one of the livestock of Israel had died. But Pharaoh’s heart remained hard, and he did not release the people.
1751	2	9	8	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a furnace, and have Moses throw it into the air while Pharaoh is watching.
1752	2	9	9	It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt and will cause boils to break out and fester on both people and animals in all the land of Egypt.”
1753	2	9	10	So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh, Moses threw it into the air, and it caused festering boils to break out on both people and animals.
1754	2	9	11	¶The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians.
1755	2	9	12	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not listen to them, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had predicted to Moses.
1756	2	9	13	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, has said: “Release my people so that they may serve me!
1757	2	9	14	For this time I will send all my plagues on your very self and on your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
1758	2	9	15	For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with plague, and you would have been destroyed from the earth.
1759	2	9	16	But for this purpose I have caused you to stand: to show you my strength, and so that my name may be declared in all the earth.
1760	2	9	17	You are still exalting yourself against my people by not releasing them.
1761	2	9	18	I am going to cause very severe hail to rain down about this time tomorrow, such hail as has never occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
1762	2	9	19	So now, send instructions to gather your livestock and all your possessions in the fields to a safe place. Every person or animal caught in the field and not brought into the house – the hail will come down on them, and they will die!”’”
1763	2	9	20	¶Those of Pharaoh’s servants who feared the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message hurried to bring their servants and livestock into the houses,
1764	2	9	21	but those who did not take the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message seriously left their servants and their cattle in the field.
1765	2	9	22	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Extend your hand toward the sky that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on people and on animals, and on everything that grows in the field in the land of Egypt.”
1766	2	9	23	When Moses extended his staff toward the sky, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent thunder and hail, and fire fell to the earth; so the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> caused hail to rain down on the land of Egypt.
1767	2	9	24	Hail fell and fire mingled with the hail; the hail was so severe that there had not been any like it in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
1768	2	9	25	The hail struck everything in the open fields, both people and animals, throughout all the land of Egypt. The hail struck everything that grows in the field, and it broke all the trees of the field to pieces.
1769	2	9	26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites lived, was there no hail.
1770	2	9	27	¶So Pharaoh sent and summoned Moses and Aaron and said to them, “I have sinned this time! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is righteous, and I and my people are guilty.
1771	2	9	28	Pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for the mighty thunderings and hail are too much! I will release you and you will stay no longer.”
1772	2	9	29	¶Moses said to him, “When I leave the city I will spread my hands to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth belongs to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
1773	2	9	30	But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God.”
1774	2	9	31	¶(Now the flax and the barley were struck by the hail, for the barley had ripened and the flax was in bud.
1775	2	9	32	But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they are later crops.)
1776	2	9	33	¶So Moses left Pharaoh, went out of the city, and spread out his hands to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain stopped pouring on the earth.
1777	2	9	34	When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder ceased, he sinned again: both he and his servants hardened their hearts.
1778	2	9	35	So Pharaoh’s heart remained hard, and he did not release the Israelites, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had predicted through Moses.
1779	2	10	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, in order to display these signs of mine before him,
1780	2	10	2	and in order that in the hearing of your son and your grandson you may tell how I made fools of the Egyptians and about my signs that I displayed among them, so that you may know that I am the Lord.”
1781	2	10	3	¶So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and told him, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, has said: ‘How long do you refuse to humble yourself before me? Release my people so that they may serve me!
1782	2	10	4	But if you refuse to release my people, I am going to bring locusts into your territory tomorrow.
1783	2	10	5	They will cover the surface of the earth, so that you will be unable to see the ground. They will eat the remainder of what escaped – what is left over for you – from the hail, and they will eat every tree that grows for you from the field.
1784	2	10	6	They will fill your houses, the houses of your servants, and all the houses of Egypt, such as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since they have been in the land until this day!’” Then Moses turned and went out from Pharaoh.
1785	2	10	7	¶Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a menace to us? Release the people so that they may serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God. Do you not know that Egypt is destroyed?”
1786	2	10	8	¶So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. Exactly who is going with you?”
1787	2	10	9	Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our sheep and our cattle we will go, because we are to hold a pilgrim feast for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
1788	2	10	10	¶He said to them, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will need to be with you if I release you and your dependents! Watch out! Trouble is right in front of you!
1789	2	10	11	No! Go, you men only, and serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for that is what you want.” Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh’s presence.
1790	2	10	12	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Extend your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up over the land of Egypt and eat everything that grows in the ground, everything that the hail has left.”
1791	2	10	13	So Moses extended his staff over the land of Egypt, and then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought an east wind on the land all that day and all night. The morning came, and the east wind had brought up the locusts!
1792	2	10	14	The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and settled down in all the territory of Egypt. It was very severe; there had been no locusts like them before, nor will there be such ever again.
1793	2	10	15	They covered the surface of all the ground, so that the ground became dark with them, and they ate all the vegetation of the ground and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Nothing green remained on the trees or on anything that grew in the fields throughout the whole land of Egypt.
1794	2	10	16	¶Then Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and against you!
1795	2	10	17	So now, forgive my sin this time only, and pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God that he would only take this death away from me.”
1796	2	10	18	Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span>
1797	2	10	19	and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> turned a very strong west wind, and it picked up the locusts and blew them into the Red Sea. Not one locust remained in all the territory of Egypt.
1798	2	10	20	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not release the Israelites.
1799	2	10	21	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Extend your hand toward heaven so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness so thick it can be felt.”
1800	2	10	22	¶So Moses extended his hand toward heaven, and there was absolute darkness throughout the land of Egypt for three days.
1801	2	10	23	No one could see another person, and no one could rise from his place for three days. But the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
1802	2	10	24	¶Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – only your flocks and herds will be detained. Even your families may go with you.”
1803	2	10	25	¶But Moses said, “Will you also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may present them to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God?
1804	2	10	26	Our livestock must also go with us! Not a hoof is to be left behind! For we must take these animals to serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God. Until we arrive there, we do not know what we must use to serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
1805	2	10	27	¶But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to release them.
1806	2	10	28	Pharaoh said to him, “Go from me! Watch out for yourself! Do not appear before me again, for when you see my face you will die!”
1807	2	10	29	Moses said, “As you wish! I will not see your face again.”
1808	2	11	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will release you from this place. When he releases you, he will drive you out completely from this place.
1809	2	11	2	Instruct the people that each man and each woman is to request from his or her neighbor items of silver and gold.”
1810	2	11	3	¶(Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> granted the people favor with the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, respected by Pharaoh’s servants and by the Egyptian people.)
1811	2	11	4	¶Moses said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt,
1812	2	11	5	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn son of the slave girl who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle.
1813	2	11	6	There will be a great cry throughout the whole land of Egypt, such as there has never been, nor ever will be again.
1814	2	11	7	But against any of the Israelites not even a dog will bark against either people or animals, so that you may know that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> distinguishes between Egypt and Israel.’
1815	2	11	8	All these your servants will come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you,’ and after that I will go out.” Then Moses went out from Pharaoh in great anger.
1816	2	11	9	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”
1817	2	11	10	¶So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not release the Israelites from his land.
1818	2	12	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
1819	2	12	2	“This month is to be your beginning of months; it will be your first month of the year.
1820	2	12	3	Tell the whole community of Israel, ‘In the tenth day of this month they each must take a lamb for themselves according to their families – a lamb for each household.
1821	2	12	4	If any household is too small for a lamb, the man and his next-door neighbor are to take a lamb according to the number of people – you will make your count for the lamb according to how much each one can eat.
1822	2	12	5	Your lamb must be perfect, a male, one year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
1823	2	12	6	You must care for it until the fourteenth day of this month, and then the whole community of Israel will kill it around sundown.
1824	2	12	7	They will take some of the blood and put it on the two side posts and top of the doorframe of the houses where they will eat it.
1825	2	12	8	They will eat the meat the same night; they will eat it roasted over the fire with bread made without yeast and with bitter herbs.
1826	2	12	9	Do not eat it raw or boiled in water, but roast it over the fire with its head, its legs, and its entrails.
1827	2	12	10	You must leave nothing until morning, but you must burn with fire whatever remains of it until morning.
1828	2	12	11	This is how you are to eat it – dressed to travel, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it in haste. It is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Passover.
1829	2	12	12	¶I will pass through the land of Egypt in the same night, and I will attack all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both of humans and of animals, and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
1830	2	12	13	The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, so that when I see the blood I will pass over you, and this plague will not fall on you to destroy you when I attack the land of Egypt.
1831	2	12	14	¶This day will become a memorial for you, and you will celebrate it as a festival to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – you will celebrate it perpetually as a lasting ordinance.
1832	2	12	15	For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast. Surely on the first day you must put away yeast from your houses because anyone who eats bread made with yeast from the first day to the seventh day will be cut off from Israel.
1833	2	12	16	¶On the first day there will be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there will be a holy convocation for you. You must do no work of any kind on them, only what every person will eat – that alone may be prepared for you.
1834	2	12	17	So you will keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I brought your regiments out from the land of Egypt, and so you must keep this day perpetually as a lasting ordinance.
1835	2	12	18	In the first month, from the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, you will eat bread made without yeast until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening.
1836	2	12	19	For seven days yeast must not be found in your houses, for whoever eats what is made with yeast – that person will be cut off from the community of Israel, whether a resident foreigner or one born in the land.
1837	2	12	20	You will not eat anything made with yeast; in all the places where you live you must eat bread made without yeast.’”
1838	2	12	21	¶Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel, and told them, “Go and select for yourselves a lamb or young goat for your families, and kill the Passover animals.
1839	2	12	22	Take a branch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply to the top of the doorframe and the two side posts some of the blood that is in the basin. Not one of you is to go out the door of his house until morning.
1840	2	12	23	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will pass through to strike Egypt, and when he sees the blood on the top of the doorframe and the two side posts, then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will pass over the door, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you.
1841	2	12	24	You must observe this event as an ordinance for you and for your children forever.
1842	2	12	25	When you enter the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will give to you, just as he said, you must observe this ceremony.
1843	2	12	26	When your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’ –
1844	2	12	27	then you will say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Passover, when he passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, when he struck Egypt and delivered our households.’” The people bowed down low to the ground,
1845	2	12	28	and the Israelites went away and did exactly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses and Aaron.
1846	2	12	29	¶It happened at midnight – the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> attacked all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison, and all the firstborn of the cattle.
1847	2	12	30	Pharaoh got up in the night, along with all his servants and all Egypt, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no house in which there was not someone dead.
1848	2	12	31	Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron in the night and said, “Get up, get out from among my people, both you and the Israelites! Go, serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as you have requested!
1849	2	12	32	Also, take your flocks and your herds, just as you have requested, and leave. But bless me also.”
1850	2	12	33	¶The Egyptians were urging the people on, in order to send them out of the land quickly, for they were saying, “We are all dead!”
1851	2	12	34	So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, with their kneading troughs bound up in their clothing on their shoulders.
1852	2	12	35	Now the Israelites had done as Moses told them – they had requested from the Egyptians silver and gold items and clothing.
1853	2	12	36	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and they gave them whatever they wanted, and so they plundered Egypt.
1854	2	12	37	¶The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about 600,000 men on foot, plus their dependents.
1855	2	12	38	A mixed multitude also went up with them, and flocks and herds – a very large number of cattle.
1856	2	12	39	They baked cakes of bread without yeast using the dough they had brought from Egypt, for it was made without yeast – because they were thrust out of Egypt and were not able to delay, they could not prepare food for themselves either.
1857	2	12	40	¶Now the length of time the Israelites lived in Egypt was 430 years.
1858	2	12	41	At the end of the 430 years, on the very day, all the regiments of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> went out of the land of Egypt.
1859	2	12	42	It was a night of vigil for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to bring them out from the land of Egypt, and so on this night all Israel is to keep the vigil to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for generations to come.
1860	2	12	43	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner may share in eating it.
1861	2	12	44	But everyone’s servant who is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, may eat it.
1862	2	12	45	A foreigner and a hired worker must not eat it.
1863	2	12	46	It must be eaten in one house; you must not bring any of the meat outside the house, and you must not break a bone of it.
1864	2	12	47	The whole community of Israel must observe it.
1865	2	12	48	¶“When a resident foreigner lives with you and wants to observe the Passover to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, all his males must be circumcised, and then he may approach and observe it, and he will be like one who is born in the land – but no uncircumcised person may eat of it.
1866	2	12	49	The same law will apply to the person who is native-born and to the resident foreigner who lives among you.”
1867	2	12	50	¶So all the Israelites did exactly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses and Aaron.
1868	2	12	51	And on this very day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their regiments.
1869	2	13	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
1870	2	13	2	“Set apart to me every firstborn male – the first offspring of every womb among the Israelites, whether human or animal; it is mine.”
1871	2	13	3	¶Moses said to the people, “Remember this day on which you came out from Egypt, from the place where you were enslaved, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought you out of there with a mighty hand – and no bread made with yeast may be eaten.
1872	2	13	4	On this day, in the month of Abib, you are going out.
1873	2	13	5	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brings you to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, then you will keep this ceremony in this month.
1874	2	13	6	For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast, and on the seventh day there is to be a festival to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
1875	2	13	7	Bread made without yeast must be eaten for seven days; no bread made with yeast shall be seen among you, and you must have no yeast among you within any of your borders.
1876	2	13	8	¶You are to tell your son on that day, ‘It is because of what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did for me when I came out of Egypt.’
1877	2	13	9	It will be a sign for you on your hand and a memorial on your forehead, so that the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> may be in your mouth, for with a mighty hand the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought you out of Egypt.
1878	2	13	10	So you must keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year.
1879	2	13	11	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,
1880	2	13	12	then you must give over to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> the first offspring of every womb. Every firstling of a beast that you have – the males will be the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s.
1881	2	13	13	Every firstling of a donkey you must redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, then you must break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you must redeem.
1882	2	13	14	¶In the future, when your son asks you ‘What is this?’ you are to tell him, ‘With a mighty hand the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought us out from Egypt, from the land of slavery.
1883	2	13	15	When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to release us, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of people to the firstborn of animals. That is why I am sacrificing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> the first male offspring of every womb, but all my firstborn sons I redeem.’
1884	2	13	16	It will be for a sign on your hand and for frontlets on your forehead, for with a mighty hand the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought us out of Egypt.”
1885	2	13	17	¶When Pharaoh released the people, God did not lead them by the way to the land of the Philistines, although that was nearby, for God said, “Lest the people change their minds and return to Egypt when they experience war.”
1886	2	13	18	So God brought the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea, and the Israelites went up from the land of Egypt prepared for battle.
1887	2	13	19	¶Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the Israelites solemnly swear, “God will surely attend to you, and you will carry my bones up from this place with you.”
1888	2	13	20	¶They journeyed from Sukkoth and camped in Etham, on the edge of the desert.
1889	2	13	21	Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was going before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them in the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel day or night.
1890	2	13	22	He did not remove the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people.
1891	2	14	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
1892	2	14	2	“Tell the Israelites that they must turn and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you are to camp by the sea before Baal Zephon opposite it.
1893	2	14	3	Pharaoh will think regarding the Israelites, ‘They are wandering around confused in the land – the desert has closed in on them.’
1894	2	14	4	I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will chase after them. I will gain honor because of Pharaoh and because of all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.” So this is what they did.
1895	2	14	5	¶When it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had fled, the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people, and the king and his servants said, “What in the world have we done? For we have released the people of Israel from serving us!”
1896	2	14	6	Then he prepared his chariots and took his army with him.
1897	2	14	7	He took six hundred select chariots, and all the rest of the chariots of Egypt, and officers on all of them.
1898	2	14	8	¶But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he chased after the Israelites. Now the Israelites were going out defiantly.
1899	2	14	9	The Egyptians chased after them, and all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
1900	2	14	10	When Pharaoh got closer, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians marching after them, and they were terrified. The Israelites cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
1901	2	14	11	and they said to Moses, “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the desert? What in the world have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
1902	2	14	12	Isn’t this what we told you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone so that we can serve the Egyptians, because it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!’”
1903	2	14	13	¶Moses said to the people, “Do not fear! Stand firm and see the salvation of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that he will provide for you today; for the Egyptians that you see today you will never, ever see again.
1904	2	14	14	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will fight for you, and you can be still.”
1905	2	14	15	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Why do you cry out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.
1906	2	14	16	And as for you, lift up your staff and extend your hand toward the sea and divide it, so that the Israelites may go through the middle of the sea on dry ground.
1907	2	14	17	And as for me, I am going to harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will come after them, that I may be honored because of Pharaoh and his army and his chariots and his horsemen.
1908	2	14	18	And the Egyptians will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> when I have gained my honor because of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”
1909	2	14	19	¶The angel of God, who was going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.
1910	2	14	20	It came between the Egyptian camp and the Israelite camp; it was a dark cloud and it lit up the night so that one camp did not come near the other the whole night.
1911	2	14	21	Moses stretched out his hand toward the sea, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> drove the sea apart by a strong east wind all that night, and he made the sea into dry land, and the water was divided.
1912	2	14	22	So the Israelites went through the middle of the sea on dry ground, the water forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.
1913	2	14	23	¶The Egyptians chased them and followed them into the middle of the sea – all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.
1914	2	14	24	In the morning watch the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and cloud, and he threw the Egyptian army into a panic.
1915	2	14	25	He jammed the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving, and the Egyptians said, “Let’s flee from Israel, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> fights for them against Egypt!”
1916	2	14	26	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Extend your hand toward the sea, so that the waters may flow back on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen!”
1917	2	14	27	So Moses extended his hand toward the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state when the sun began to rise. Now the Egyptians were fleeing before it, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.
1918	2	14	28	The water returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the army of Pharaoh that was coming after the Israelites into the sea – not so much as one of them survived!
1919	2	14	29	But the Israelites walked on dry ground in the middle of the sea, the water forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.
1920	2	14	30	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> saved Israel on that day from the power of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore of the sea.
1921	2	14	31	When Israel saw the great power that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had exercised over the Egyptians, they feared the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and they believed in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and in his servant Moses.
1922	2	15	1	¶Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They said, ‡“I will sing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> for he has triumphed gloriously, ‡the horse and its rider he has thrown into the sea.
1923	2	15	2	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is my strength and my song, ‡and he has become my salvation.‡This is my God, and I will praise him, ‡my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
1924	2	15	3	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is a warrior, ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is his name.
1925	2	15	4	‡The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he has thrown into the sea,‡and his chosen officers were drowned in the Red Sea.
1926	2	15	5	‡The depths have covered them, ‡they went down to the bottom like a stone.
1927	2	15	6	‡Your right hand, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, was majestic in power,‡your right hand, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, shattered the enemy.
1928	2	15	7	‡In the abundance of your majesty you have overthrown ‡those who rise up against you. ‡You sent forth your wrath; ‡it consumed them like stubble.
1929	2	15	8	‡By the blast of your nostrils the waters were piled up,‡the flowing water stood upright like a heap, ‡and the deep waters were solidified in the heart of the sea.
1930	2	15	9	‡The enemy said, ‘I will chase, I will overtake, ‡I will divide the spoil;‡my desire will be satisfied on them.‡I will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them.’
1931	2	15	10	‡But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them.‡They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
1932	2	15	11	‡Who is like you, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, among the gods? ‡Who is like you? – majestic in holiness, fearful in praises, working wonders?
1933	2	15	12	‡You stretched out your right hand,‡the earth swallowed them.
1934	2	15	13	‡By your loyal love you will lead the people whom you have redeemed;‡you will guide them by your strength to your holy dwelling place.
1935	2	15	14	‡The nations will hear and tremble;‡anguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia.
1936	2	15	15	‡Then the chiefs of Edom will be terrified, ‡trembling will seize the leaders of Moab,‡and the inhabitants of Canaan will shake.
1937	2	15	16	‡Fear and dread will fall on them;‡by the greatness of your arm they will be as still as stone ‡until your people pass by, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡until the people whom you have bought pass by.
1938	2	15	17	‡You will bring them in and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,‡in the place you made for your residence, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡the sanctuary, O Lord, that your hands have established.
1939	2	15	18	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will reign forever and ever!
1940	2	15	19	‡For the horses of Pharaoh came with his chariots and his footmen into the sea,‡and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought back the waters of the sea on them,‡but the Israelites walked on dry land in the middle of the sea.”
1941	2	15	20	¶Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a hand-drum in her hand, and all the women went out after her with hand-drums and with dances.
1942	2	15	21	Miriam sang in response to them, “Sing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and its rider he has thrown into the sea.”
1943	2	15	22	¶Then Moses led Israel to journey away from the Red Sea. They went out to the wilderness of Shur, walked for three days into the wilderness, and found no water.
1944	2	15	23	Then they came to Marah, but they were not able to drink the waters of Marah, because they were bitter. (That is why its name was Marah.)
1945	2	15	24	¶So the people murmured against Moses, saying, “What can we drink?”
1946	2	15	25	He cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> showed him a tree. When Moses threw it into the water, the water became safe to drink. There the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made for them a binding ordinance, and there he tested them.
1947	2	15	26	He said, “If you will diligently obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, and do what is right in his sight, and pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, then all the diseases that I brought on the Egyptians I will not bring on you, for I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> am your healer.”
1948	2	15	27	¶Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the water.
1949	2	16	1	¶When they journeyed from Elim, the entire company of Israelites came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their exodus from the land of Egypt.
1950	2	16	2	The entire company of Israelites murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
1951	2	16	3	The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger!”
1952	2	16	4	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people will go out and gather the amount for each day, so that I may test them. Will they walk in my law or not?
1953	2	16	5	On the sixth day they will prepare what they bring in, and it will be twice as much as they gather every other day.”
1954	2	16	6	¶Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has brought you out of the land of Egypt,
1955	2	16	7	and in the morning you will see the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, because he has heard your murmurings against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. As for us, what are we, that you should murmur against us?”
1956	2	16	8	¶Moses said, “You will know this when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gives you meat to eat in the evening and bread in the morning to satisfy you, because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has heard your murmurings that you are murmuring against him. As for us, what are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
1957	2	16	9	¶Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole community of the Israelites, ‘Come before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, because he has heard your murmurings.’”
1958	2	16	10	¶As Aaron spoke to the whole community of the Israelites and they looked toward the wilderness, there the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared in the cloud,
1959	2	16	11	and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
1960	2	16	12	“I have heard the murmurings of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘During the evening you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be satisfied with bread, so that you may know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.’”
1961	2	16	13	¶In the evening the quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning a layer of dew was all around the camp.
1962	2	16	14	When the layer of dew had evaporated, there on the surface of the wilderness was a thin flaky substance, thin like frost on the earth.
1963	2	16	15	When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” because they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given you for food.
1964	2	16	16	¶“This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded: ‘Each person is to gather from it what he can eat, an omer per person according to the number of your people; each one will pick it up for whoever lives in his tent.’”
1965	2	16	17	The Israelites did so, and they gathered – some more, some less.
1966	2	16	18	When they measured with an omer, the one who gathered much had nothing left over, and the one who gathered little lacked nothing; each one had gathered what he could eat.
1967	2	16	19	¶Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.”
1968	2	16	20	But they did not listen to Moses; some kept part of it until morning, and it was full of worms and began to stink, and Moses was angry with them.
1969	2	16	21	So they gathered it each morning, each person according to what he could eat, and when the sun got hot, it would melt.
1970	2	16	22	And on the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, two omers per person; and all the leaders of the community came and told Moses.
1971	2	16	23	He said to them, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: ‘Tomorrow is a time of cessation from work, a holy Sabbath to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord. </span>Whatever you want to bake, bake today; whatever you want to boil, boil today; whatever is left put aside for yourselves to be kept until morning.’”
1972	2	16	24	¶So they put it aside until the morning, just as Moses had commanded, and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it.
1973	2	16	25	Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; today you will not find it in the area.
1974	2	16	26	Six days you will gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.”
1975	2	16	27	¶On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather it, but they found nothing.
1976	2	16	28	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to obey my commandments and my instructions?
1977	2	16	29	See, because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given you the Sabbath, that is why he is giving you food for two days on the sixth day. Each of you stay where you are; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.”
1978	2	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
1979	2	16	31	¶The house of Israel called its name “manna.” It was like coriander seed and was white, and it tasted like wafers with honey.
1980	2	16	32	¶Moses said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded: ‘Fill an omer with it to be kept for generations to come, so that they may see the food I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.’”
1981	2	16	33	Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put in it an omer full of manna, and place it before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to be kept for generations to come.”
1982	2	16	34	Just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony for safekeeping.
1983	2	16	35	¶Now the Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was inhabited; they ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
1984	2	16	36	(Now an omer is one tenth of an ephah.)
1985	2	17	1	¶The whole community of the Israelites traveled on their journey from the wilderness of Sin according to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s instruction, and they pitched camp in Rephidim. Now there was no water for the people to drink.
1986	2	17	2	So the people contended with Moses, and they said, “Give us water to drink!” Moses said to them, “Why do you contend with me? Why do you test the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord?</span>”
1987	2	17	3	But the people were very thirsty there for water, and they murmured against Moses and said, “Why in the world did you bring us up from Egypt – to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?”
1988	2	17	4	¶Then Moses cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “What will I do with this people? – a little more and they will stone me!”
1989	2	17	5	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go over before the people; take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile and go.
1990	2	17	6	I will be standing before you there on the rock in Horeb, and you will strike the rock, and water will come out of it so that the people may drink.” And Moses did so in plain view of the elders of Israel.
1991	2	17	7	¶He called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the contending of the Israelites and because of their testing the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, saying, “Is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> among us or not?”
1992	2	17	8	¶Amalek came and attacked Israel in Rephidim.
1993	2	17	9	So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out, fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.”
1994	2	17	10	¶So Joshua fought against Amalek just as Moses had instructed him, and Moses and Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
1995	2	17	11	Whenever Moses would raise his hands, then Israel prevailed, but whenever he would rest his hands, then Amalek prevailed.
1996	2	17	12	When the hands of Moses became heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side and one on the other, and so his hands were steady until the sun went down.
1997	2	17	13	So Joshua destroyed Amalek and his army with the sword.
1998	2	17	14	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Write this as a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in Joshua’s hearing; for I will surely wipe out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
1999	2	17	15	Moses built an altar, and he called it “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is my Banner,”
2000	2	17	16	for he said, “For a hand was lifted up to the throne of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”
2001	2	18	1	¶Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard about all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had brought Israel out of Egypt.
2002	2	18	2	¶Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Moses’ wife Zipporah after he had sent her back,
2003	2	18	3	and her two sons, one of whom was named Gershom (for Moses had said, “I have been a foreigner in a foreign land”),
2004	2	18	4	and the other Eliezer (for Moses had said, “The God of my father has been my help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”).
2005	2	18	5	¶Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, together with Moses’ sons and his wife, came to Moses in the wilderness where he was camping by the mountain of God.
2006	2	18	6	He said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you, along with your wife and her two sons with her.”
2007	2	18	7	Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him; they each asked about the other’s welfare, and then they went into the tent.
2008	2	18	8	Moses told his father-in-law all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt for Israel’s sake, and all the hardship that had come on them along the way, and how the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had delivered them.
2009	2	18	9	¶Jethro rejoiced because of all the good that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had done for Israel, whom he had delivered from the hand of Egypt.
2010	2	18	10	Jethro said, “Blessed be the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who has delivered you from the hand of Egypt, and from the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from the Egyptians’ control!
2011	2	18	11	Now I know that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is greater than all the gods, for in the thing in which they dealt proudly against them he has destroyed them.”
2012	2	18	12	Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat food with the father-in-law of Moses before God.
2013	2	18	13	¶On the next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning until evening.
2014	2	18	14	When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why are you sitting by yourself, and all the people stand around you from morning until evening?”
2015	2	18	15	¶Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
2016	2	18	16	When they have a dispute, it comes to me and I decide between a man and his neighbor, and I make known the decrees of God and his laws.”
2017	2	18	17	¶Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good!
2018	2	18	18	You will surely wear out, both you and these people who are with you, for this is too heavy a burden for you; you are not able to do it by yourself.
2019	2	18	19	Now listen to me, I will give you advice, and may God be with you: You be a representative for the people to God, and you bring their disputes to God;
2020	2	18	20	warn them of the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they must walk and the work they must do.
2021	2	18	21	But you choose from the people capable men, God-fearing, men of truth, those who hate bribes, and put them over the people as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
2022	2	18	22	They will judge the people under normal circumstances, and every difficult case they will bring to you, but every small case they themselves will judge, so that you may make it easier for yourself, and they will bear the burden with you.
2023	2	18	23	If you do this thing, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people will be able to go home satisfied.”
2024	2	18	24	¶Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he had said.
2025	2	18	25	Moses chose capable men from all Israel, and he made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
2026	2	18	26	They judged the people under normal circumstances; the difficult cases they would bring to Moses, but every small case they would judge themselves.
2027	2	18	27	¶Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and so Jethro went to his own land.
2028	2	19	1	¶In the third month after the Israelites went out from the land of Egypt, on the very day, they came to the desert of Sinai.
2029	2	19	2	After they journeyed from Rephidim, they came to the desert of Sinai, and they camped in the desert; Israel camped there in front of the mountain.
2030	2	19	3	¶Moses went up to God, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> called to him from the mountain, “Thus you will tell the house of Jacob, and declare to the people of Israel:
2031	2	19	4	‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I lifted you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.
2032	2	19	5	And now, if you will diligently listen to me and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession out of all the nations, for all the earth is mine,
2033	2	19	6	and you will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you will speak to the Israelites.”
2034	2	19	7	¶So Moses came and summoned the elders of Israel. He set before them all these words that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded him,
2035	2	19	8	and all the people answered together, “All that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded we will do!” So Moses brought the words of the people back to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
2036	2	19	9	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and so that they will always believe in you.” And Moses told the words of the people to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
2037	2	19	10	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and make them wash their clothes
2038	2	19	11	and be ready for the third day, for on the third day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
2039	2	19	12	You must set boundaries for the people all around, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves not to go up on the mountain nor touch its edge. Whoever touches the mountain will surely be put to death!
2040	2	19	13	No hand will touch him – but he will surely be stoned or shot through, whether a beast or a human being; he must not live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast they may go up on the mountain.”
2041	2	19	14	¶Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes.
2042	2	19	15	He said to the people, “Be ready for the third day. Do not approach your wives for marital relations.”
2043	2	19	16	¶On the third day in the morning there was thunder and lightning and a dense cloud on the mountain, and the sound of a very loud horn; all the people who were in the camp trembled.
2044	2	19	17	Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their place at the foot of the mountain.
2045	2	19	18	Now Mount Sinai was completely covered with smoke because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had descended on it in fire, and its smoke went up like the smoke of a great furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently.
2046	2	19	19	When the sound of the horn grew louder and louder, Moses was speaking and God was answering him with a voice.
2047	2	19	20	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came down on Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
2048	2	19	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go down and solemnly warn the people, lest they force their way through to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to look, and many of them perish.
2049	2	19	22	Let the priests also, who approach the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, sanctify themselves, lest the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> break through against them.”
2050	2	19	23	¶Moses said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “The people are not able to come up to Mount Sinai, because you solemnly warned us, ‘Set boundaries for the mountain and set it apart.’”
2051	2	19	24	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Go, get down, and come up, and Aaron with you, but do not let the priests and the people force their way through to come up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, lest he break through against them.”
2052	2	19	25	So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.
2053	2	20	1	¶God spoke all these words:
2054	2	20	2	¶“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, am your God, who brought you from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
2055	2	20	3	¶“You shall have no other gods before me.
2056	2	20	4	¶“You shall not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is on the earth beneath or that is in the water below.
2057	2	20	5	You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, your God, am a jealous God, responding to the transgression of fathers by dealing with children to the third and fourth generations of those who reject me,
2058	2	20	6	and showing covenant faithfulness to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
2059	2	20	7	¶“You shall not take the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in vain, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will not hold guiltless anyone who takes his name in vain.
2060	2	20	8	¶<b></b> “Remember the Sabbath day to set it apart as holy.
2061	2	20	9	For six days you may labor and do all your work,
2062	2	20	10	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God; on it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, or your male servant, or your female servant, or your cattle, or the resident foreigner who is in your gates.
2063	2	20	11	For in six days the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that is in them, and he rested on the seventh day; therefore the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart as holy.
2064	2	20	12	¶“Honor your father and your mother, that you may live a long time in the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving to you.
2065	2	20	13	¶“You shall not murder.
2066	2	20	14	¶“You shall not commit adultery.
2067	2	20	15	¶“You shall not steal.
2068	2	20	16	¶“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
2069	2	20	17	¶“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
2070	2	20	18	¶All the people were seeing the thundering and the lightning, and heard the sound of the horn, and saw the mountain smoking – and when the people saw it they trembled with fear and kept their distance.
2071	2	20	19	They said to Moses, “You speak to us and we will listen, but do not let God speak with us, lest we die.”
2072	2	20	20	Moses said to the people, “Do not fear, for God has come to test you, that the fear of him may be before you so that you do not sin.”
2073	2	20	21	The people kept their distance, but Moses drew near the thick darkness where God was.
2074	2	20	22	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses: “Thus you will tell the Israelites: ‘You yourselves have seen that I have spoken with you from heaven.
2075	2	20	23	You must not make gods of silver alongside me, nor make gods of gold for yourselves.
2076	2	20	24	¶‘You must make for me an altar made of earth, and you will sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause my name to be honored I will come to you and I will bless you.
2077	2	20	25	If you make me an altar of stone, you must not build it of stones shaped with tools, for if you use your tool on it you have defiled it.
2078	2	20	26	And you must not go up by steps to my altar, so that your nakedness is not exposed.’
2079	2	21	1	¶“These are the decisions that you will set before them:
2080	2	21	2	¶“If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years, but in the seventh year he will go out free without paying anything.
2081	2	21	3	If he came in by himself he will go out by himself; if he had a wife when he came in, then his wife will go out with him.
2082	2	21	4	If his master gave him a wife, and she bore sons or daughters, the wife and the children will belong to her master, and he will go out by himself.
2083	2	21	5	But if the servant should declare, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’
2084	2	21	6	then his master must bring him to the judges, and he will bring him to the door or the doorpost, and his master will pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him forever.
2085	2	21	7	¶“If a man sells his daughter as a female servant, she will not go out as the male servants do.
2086	2	21	8	If she does not please her master, who has designated her for himself, then he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to a foreign nation, because he has dealt deceitfully with her.
2087	2	21	9	If he designated her for his son, then he will deal with her according to the customary rights of daughters.
2088	2	21	10	If he takes another wife, he must not diminish the first one’s food, her clothing, or her marital rights.
2089	2	21	11	If he does not provide her with these three things, then she will go out free, without paying money.
2090	2	21	12	¶“Whoever strikes someone so that he dies must surely be put to death.
2091	2	21	13	But if he does not do it with premeditation, but it happens by accident, then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee.
2092	2	21	14	But if a man willfully attacks his neighbor to kill him cunningly, you will take him even from my altar that he may die.
2093	2	21	15	¶“Whoever strikes his father or his mother must surely be put to death.
2094	2	21	16	¶“Whoever kidnaps someone and sells him, or is caught still holding him, must surely be put to death.
2095	2	21	17	¶“Whoever treats his father or his mother disgracefully must surely be put to death.
2096	2	21	18	¶“If men fight, and one strikes his neighbor with a stone or with his fist and he does not die, but must remain in bed,
2097	2	21	19	and then if he gets up and walks about outside on his staff, then the one who struck him is innocent, except he must pay for the injured person’s loss of time and see to it that he is fully healed.
2098	2	21	20	¶“If a man strikes his male servant or his female servant with a staff so that he or she dies as a result of the blow, he will surely be punished.
2099	2	21	21	However, if the injured servant survives one or two days, the owner will not be punished, for he has suffered the loss.
2100	2	21	22	¶<b> “</b>If men fight and hit a pregnant woman and her child is born prematurely, but there is no serious injury, he will surely be punished in accordance with what the woman’s husband demands of him, and he will pay what the court decides.
2101	2	21	23	But if there is serious injury, then you will give a life for a life,
2102	2	21	24	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
2103	2	21	25	burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
2104	2	21	26	¶“If a man strikes the eye of his male servant or his female servant so that he destroys it, he will let the servant go free as compensation for the eye.
2105	2	21	27	If he knocks out the tooth of his male servant or his female servant, he will let the servant go free as compensation for the tooth.
2106	2	21	28	¶“If an ox gores a man or a woman so that either dies, then the ox must surely be stoned and its flesh must not be eaten, but the owner of the ox will be acquitted.
2107	2	21	29	But if the ox had the habit of goring, and its owner was warned, and he did not take the necessary precautions, and then it killed a man or a woman, the ox must be stoned and the man must be put to death.
2108	2	21	30	If a ransom is set for him, then he must pay the redemption for his life according to whatever amount was set for him.
2109	2	21	31	If the ox gores a son or a daughter, the owner will be dealt with according to this rule.
2110	2	21	32	If the ox gores a male servant or a female servant, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver, and the ox must be stoned.
2111	2	21	33	¶“If a man opens a pit or if a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
2112	2	21	34	the owner of the pit must repay the loss. He must give money to its owner, and the dead animal will become his.
2113	2	21	35	If the ox of one man injures the ox of his neighbor so that it dies, then they will sell the live ox and divide its proceeds, and they will also divide the dead ox.
2114	2	21	36	Or if it is known that the ox had the habit of goring, and its owner did not take the necessary precautions, he must surely pay ox for ox, and the dead animal will become his.
2115	2	22	1	¶(21:37) “If a man steals an ox or a sheep and kills it or sells it, he must pay back five head of cattle for the ox, and four sheep for the one sheep.
2116	2	22	2	¶“If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there will be no blood guilt for him.
2117	2	22	3	If the sun has risen on him, then there is blood guilt for him. A thief must surely make full restitution; if he has nothing, then he will be sold for his theft.
2118	2	22	4	If the stolen item should in fact be found alive in his possession, whether it be an ox or a donkey or a sheep, he must pay back double.
2119	2	22	5	¶“If a man grazes his livestock in a field or a vineyard, and he lets the livestock loose and they graze in the field of another man, he must make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard.
2120	2	22	6	¶“If a fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes, so that stacked grain or standing grain or the whole field is consumed, the one who started the fire must surely make restitution.
2121	2	22	7	¶“If a man gives his neighbor money or articles for safekeeping, and it is stolen from the man’s house, if the thief is caught, he must repay double.
2122	2	22	8	If the thief is not caught, then the owner of the house will be brought before the judges to see whether he has laid his hand on his neighbor’s goods.
2123	2	22	9	In all cases of illegal possessions, whether for an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or any kind of lost item, about which someone says ‘This belongs to me,’ the matter of the two of them will come before the judges, and the one whom the judges declare guilty must repay double to his neighbor.
2124	2	22	10	If a man gives his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep, and it dies or is injured or is carried away without anyone seeing it,
2125	2	22	11	then there will be an oath to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> between the two of them, that he has not laid his hand on his neighbor’s goods, and its owner will accept this, and he will not have to pay.
2126	2	22	12	But if it was stolen from him, he will pay its owner.
2127	2	22	13	If it is torn in pieces, then he will bring it for evidence, and he will not have to pay for what was torn.
2128	2	22	14	¶“If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor, and it is hurt or dies when its owner was not with it, the man who borrowed it will surely pay.
2129	2	22	15	If its owner was with it, he will not have to pay; if it was hired, what was paid for the hire covers it.
2130	2	22	16	¶“If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged and goes to bed with her, he must surely pay the marriage price for her to be his wife.
2131	2	22	17	If her father refuses to give her to him, he must pay money for the bride price of virgins.
2132	2	22	18	¶“You must not allow a sorceress to live.
2133	2	22	19	¶“Whoever has sexual relations with a beast must surely be put to death.
2134	2	22	20	¶“Whoever sacrifices to a god other than the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> alone must be utterly destroyed.
2135	2	22	21	¶“You must not wrong a resident foreigner nor oppress him, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
2136	2	22	22	¶“You must not afflict any widow or orphan.
2137	2	22	23	If you afflict them in any way and they cry to me, I will surely hear their cry,
2138	2	22	24	and my anger will burn and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives will be widows and your children will be fatherless.
2139	2	22	25	¶“If you lend money to any of my people who are needy among you, do not be like a moneylender to him; do not charge him interest.
2140	2	22	26	If you do take the garment of your neighbor in pledge, you must return it to him by the time the sun goes down,
2141	2	22	27	for it is his only covering – it is his garment for his body. What else can he sleep in? And when he cries out to me, I will hear, for I am gracious.
2142	2	22	28	¶“You must not blaspheme God or curse the ruler of your people.
2143	2	22	29	¶“Do not hold back offerings from your granaries or your vats. You must give me the firstborn of your sons.
2144	2	22	30	You must also do this for your oxen and for your sheep; seven days they may remain with their mothers, but give them to me on the eighth day.
2145	2	22	31	¶“You will be holy people to me; you must not eat any meat torn by animals in the field. You must throw it to the dogs.
2146	2	23	1	¶“You must not give a false report. Do not make common cause with the wicked to be a malicious witness.
2147	2	23	2	¶“You must not follow a crowd in doing evil things; in a lawsuit you must not offer testimony that agrees with a crowd so as to pervert justice,
2148	2	23	3	and you must not show partiality to a poor man in his lawsuit.
2149	2	23	4	¶“If you encounter your enemy’s ox or donkey wandering off, you must by all means return it to him.
2150	2	23	5	If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen under its load, you must not ignore him, but be sure to help him with it.
2151	2	23	6	¶“You must not turn away justice for your poor people in their lawsuits.
2152	2	23	7	Keep your distance from a false charge – do not kill the innocent and the righteous, for I will not justify the wicked.
2153	2	23	8	¶“You must not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and subverts the words of the righteous.
2154	2	23	9	¶“You must not oppress a resident foreigner, since you know the life of a foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
2155	2	23	10	¶“For six years you are to sow your land and gather in its produce.
2156	2	23	11	But in the seventh year you must let it lie fallow and leave it alone so that the poor of your people may eat, and what they leave any animal in the field may eat; you must do likewise with your vineyard and your olive grove.
2157	2	23	12	For six days you are to do your work, but on the seventh day you must cease, in order that your ox and your donkey may rest and that your female servant’s son and the resident foreigner may refresh themselves.
2158	2	23	13	¶“Pay attention to do everything I have told you, and do not even mention the names of other gods – do not let them be heard on your lips.
2159	2	23	14	¶“Three times in the year you must make a pilgrim feast to me.
2160	2	23	15	You are to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread; seven days you must eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib, for at that time you came out of Egypt. No one may appear before me empty-handed.
2161	2	23	16	¶“You are also to observe the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labors that you have sown in the field, and the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year when you have gathered in your harvest out of the field.
2162	2	23	17	At three times in the year all your males will appear before the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2163	2	23	18	¶“You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice with bread containing yeast; the fat of my festal sacrifice must not remain until morning.
2164	2	23	19	The first of the firstfruits of your soil you must bring to the house of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. ¶“You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
2165	2	23	20	¶“I am going to send an angel before you to protect you as you journey and to bring you into the place that I have prepared.
2166	2	23	21	Take heed because of him, and obey his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him.
2167	2	23	22	But if you diligently obey him and do all that I command, then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and I will be an adversary to your adversaries.
2168	2	23	23	For my angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I will destroy them completely.
2169	2	23	24	¶“You must not bow down to their gods; you must not serve them or do according to their practices. Instead you must completely overthrow them and smash their standing stones to pieces.
2170	2	23	25	You must serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, and he will bless your bread and your water, and I will remove sickness from your midst.
2171	2	23	26	No woman will miscarry her young or be barren in your land. I will fulfill the number of your days.
2172	2	23	27	¶“I will send my terror before you, and I will alarm all the people whom you encounter; I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.
2173	2	23	28	I will send hornets before you that will drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite before you.
2174	2	23	29	I will not drive them out before you in one year, lest the land become desolate and the wild animals multiply against you.
2175	2	23	30	Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you become fruitful and inherit the land.
2176	2	23	31	I will set your boundaries from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the River, for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you will drive them out before you.
2177	2	23	32	¶“You must make no covenant with them or with their gods.
2178	2	23	33	They must not live in your land, lest they make you sin against me, for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.”
2179	2	24	1	¶But to Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Come up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from a distance.
2180	2	24	2	Moses alone may come near the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, but the others must not come near, nor may the people go up with him.”
2181	2	24	3	¶Moses came and told the people all the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s words and all the decisions. All the people answered together, “We are willing to do all the words that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said,”
2182	2	24	4	and Moses wrote down all the words of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Early in the morning he built an altar at the foot of the mountain and arranged twelve standing stones – according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
2183	2	24	5	He sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls for peace offerings to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2184	2	24	6	Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and half of the blood he splashed on the altar.
2185	2	24	7	He took the Book of the Covenant and read it aloud to the people, and they said, “We are willing to do and obey all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken.”
2186	2	24	8	So Moses took the blood and splashed it on the people and said, “This is the blood of the covenant that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has made with you in accordance with all these words.”
2187	2	24	9	¶Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel went up,
2188	2	24	10	and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there was something like a pavement made of sapphire, clear like the sky itself.
2189	2	24	11	But he did not lay a hand on the leaders of the Israelites, so they saw God, and they ate and they drank.
2190	2	24	12	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and remain there, and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandments that I have written, so that you may teach them.”
2191	2	24	13	So Moses set out with Joshua his attendant, and Moses went up the mountain of God.
2192	2	24	14	He told the elders, “Wait for us in this place until we return to you. Here are Aaron and Hur with you. Whoever has any matters of dispute can approach them.”
2193	2	24	15	¶Moses went up the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.
2194	2	24	16	The glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> resided on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day he called to Moses from within the cloud.
2195	2	24	17	Now the appearance of the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in plain view of the people.
2196	2	24	18	Moses went into the cloud when he went up the mountain, and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
2197	2	25	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
2198	2	25	2	“Tell the Israelites to take an offering for me; from every person motivated by a willing heart you are to receive my offering.
2199	2	25	3	This is the offering you are to accept from them: gold, silver, bronze,
2200	2	25	4	blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goat’s hair,
2201	2	25	5	ram skins dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood,
2202	2	25	6	oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for fragrant incense,
2203	2	25	7	onyx stones, and other gems to be set in the ephod and in the breastpiece.
2204	2	25	8	Let them make for me a sanctuary, so that I may live among them.
2205	2	25	9	According to all that I am showing you – the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings – you must make it exactly so.
2206	2	25	10	¶“They are to make an ark of acacia wood – its length is to be three feet nine inches, its width two feet three inches, and its height two feet three inches.
2207	2	25	11	You are to overlay it with pure gold – both inside and outside you must overlay it, and you are to make a surrounding border of gold over it.
2208	2	25	12	You are to cast four gold rings for it and put them on its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other side.
2209	2	25	13	You are to make poles of acacia wood, overlay them with gold,
2210	2	25	14	and put the poles into the rings at the sides of the ark in order to carry the ark with them.
2211	2	25	15	The poles must remain in the rings of the ark; they must not be removed from it.
2212	2	25	16	You are to put into the ark the testimony that I will give to you.
2213	2	25	17	¶<b> “</b>You are to make an atonement lid of pure gold; its length is to be three feet nine inches, and its width is to be two feet three inches.
2214	2	25	18	You are to make two cherubim of gold; you are to make them of hammered metal on the two ends of the atonement lid.
2215	2	25	19	Make one cherub on one end and one cherub on the other end; from the atonement lid you are to make the cherubim on the two ends.
2216	2	25	20	The cherubim are to be spreading their wings upward, overshadowing the atonement lid with their wings, and the cherubim are to face each other, looking toward the atonement lid.
2217	2	25	21	You are to put the atonement lid on top of the ark, and in the ark you are to put the testimony I am giving you.
2218	2	25	22	I will meet with you there, and from above the atonement lid, from between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the testimony, I will speak with you about all that I will command you for the Israelites.
2219	2	25	23	¶“You are to make a table of acacia wood; its length is to be three feet, its width one foot six inches, and its height two feet three inches.
2220	2	25	24	You are to overlay it with pure gold, and you are to make a surrounding border of gold for it.
2221	2	25	25	You are to make a surrounding frame for it about three inches broad, and you are to make a surrounding border of gold for its frame.
2222	2	25	26	You are to make four rings of gold for it and attach the rings at the four corners where its four legs are.
2223	2	25	27	The rings are to be close to the frame to provide places for the poles to carry the table.
2224	2	25	28	You are to make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, so that the table may be carried with them.
2225	2	25	29	You are to make its plates, its ladles, its pitchers, and its bowls, to be used in pouring out offerings; you are to make them of pure gold.
2226	2	25	30	You are to set the Bread of the Presence on the table before me continually.
2227	2	25	31	¶“You are to make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand is to be made of hammered metal; its base and its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its blossoms are to be from the same piece.
2228	2	25	32	Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand, three branches of the lampstand from one side of it and three branches of the lampstand from the other side of it.
2229	2	25	33	Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on one branch, and three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on the next branch, and the same for the six branches extending from the lampstand.
2230	2	25	34	On the lampstand there are to be four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms,
2231	2	25	35	with a bud under the first two branches from it, and a bud under the next two branches from it, and a bud under the third two branches from it, according to the six branches that extend from the lampstand.
2232	2	25	36	Their buds and their branches will be one piece, all of it one hammered piece of pure gold.
2233	2	25	37	¶“You are to make its seven lamps, and then set its lamps up on it, so that it will give light to the area in front of it.
2234	2	25	38	Its trimmers and its trays are to be of pure gold.
2235	2	25	39	About seventy-five pounds of pure gold is to be used for it and for all these utensils.
2236	2	25	40	Now be sure to make them according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain.

2365	2	29	28	It is to belong to Aaron and to his sons from the Israelites, by a perpetual ordinance, for it is a contribution. It is to be a contribution from the Israelites from their peace offerings, their contribution to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2366	2	29	29	¶“The holy garments that belong to Aaron are to belong to his sons after him, so that they may be anointed in them and consecrated in them.
2367	2	29	30	The priest who succeeds him from his sons, when he first comes to the tent of meeting to minister in the Holy Place, is to wear them for seven days.

2370	2	29	33	They are to eat those things by which atonement was made to consecrate and to set them apart, but no one else may eat them, for they are holy.
2371	2	29	34	If any of the meat from the consecration offerings or any of the bread is left over until morning, then you are to burn up what is left over. It must not be eaten, because it is holy.
2372	2	29	35	¶“Thus you are to do for Aaron and for his sons, according to all that I have commanded you; you are to consecrate them for seven days.
2373	2	29	36	Every day you are to prepare a bull for a purification offering for atonement. You are to purify the altar by making atonement for it, and you are to anoint it to set it apart as holy.
2374	2	29	37	For seven days you are to make atonement for the altar and set it apart as holy. Then the altar will be most holy. Anything that touches the altar will be holy.

2376	2	29	39	The first lamb you are to prepare in the morning, and the second lamb you are to prepare around sundown.
2377	2	29	40	With the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil from pressed olives, and a fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering.

2382	2	29	45	I will reside among the Israelites, and I will be their God,
2383	2	29	46	and they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God, who brought them out from the land of Egypt, so that I may reside among them. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God.

2402	2	30	19	and Aaron and his sons must wash their hands and their feet from it.
2403	2	30	20	When they enter the tent of meeting, they must wash with water so that they do not die. Also, when they approach the altar to minister by burning incense as an offering made by fire to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
2404	2	30	21	they must wash their hands and their feet so that they do not die. And this will be a perpetual ordinance for them and for their descendants throughout their generations.”
2405	2	30	22	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
2406	2	30	23	“Take choice spices: twelve and a half pounds of free-flowing myrrh, half that – about six and a quarter pounds – of sweet-smelling cinnamon, six and a quarter pounds of sweet-smelling cane,
2407	2	30	24	and twelve and a half pounds of cassia, all weighed according to the sanctuary shekel, and four quarts of olive oil.
2408	2	30	25	You are to make this into a sacred anointing oil, a perfumed compound, the work of a perfumer. It will be sacred anointing oil.
2409	2	30	26	¶“With it you are to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony,
2410	2	30	27	the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense,
2411	2	30	28	the altar for the burnt offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its base.
2412	2	30	29	So you are to sanctify them, and they will be most holy; anything that touches them will be holy.
2413	2	30	30	¶“You are to anoint Aaron and his sons and sanctify them, so that they may minister as my priests.
2414	2	30	31	And you are to tell the Israelites: ‘This is to be my sacred anointing oil throughout your generations.
2415	2	30	32	It must not be applied to people’s bodies, and you must not make any like it with the same recipe. It is holy, and it must be holy to you.
2416	2	30	33	Whoever makes perfume like it and whoever puts any of it on someone not a priest will be cut off from his people.’”
2417	2	30	34	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses: “Take spices, gum resin, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense of equal amounts
2418	2	30	35	and make it into an incense, a perfume, the work of a perfumer. It is to be finely ground, and pure and sacred.
2419	2	30	36	You are to beat some of it very fine and put some of it before the ark of the testimony in the tent of meeting where I will meet with you; it is to be most holy to you.
2420	2	30	37	And the incense that you are to make, you must not make for yourselves using the same recipe; it is to be most holy to you, belonging to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2421	2	30	38	Whoever makes anything like it, to use as perfume, will be cut off from his people.”
2422	2	31	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
2423	2	31	2	“See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
2424	2	31	3	and I have filled him with the Spirit of God in skill, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship,
2425	2	31	4	to make artistic designs for work with gold, with silver, and with bronze,
2426	2	31	5	and with cutting and setting stone, and with cutting wood, to work in all kinds of craftsmanship.
2427	2	31	6	Moreover, I have also given him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and I have given ability to all the specially skilled, that they may make everything I have commanded you:
2428	2	31	7	the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, the atonement lid that is on it, all the furnishings of the tent,
2429	2	31	8	the table with its utensils, the pure lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense,
2430	2	31	9	the altar for the burnt offering with all its utensils, the large basin with its base,
2431	2	31	10	the woven garments, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons, to minister as priests,
2432	2	31	11	the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the Holy Place. They will make all these things just as I have commanded you.”
2433	2	31	12	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses,
2434	2	31	13	“Tell the Israelites, ‘Surely you must keep my Sabbaths, for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who sanctifies you.
2435	2	31	14	So you must keep the Sabbath, for it is holy for you. Everyone who defiles it must surely be put to death; indeed, if anyone does any work on it, then that person will be cut off from among his people.
2436	2	31	15	Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; anyone who does work on the Sabbath day must surely be put to death.
2437	2	31	16	The Israelites must keep the Sabbath by observing the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.
2438	2	31	17	It is a sign between me and the Israelites forever; for in six days the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’”
2439	2	31	18	¶He gave Moses two tablets of testimony when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, tablets of stone written by the finger of God.
2440	2	32	1	¶When the people saw that Moses delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said to him, “Get up, make us gods that will go before us. As for this fellow Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him!”
2441	2	32	2	¶So Aaron said to them, “Break off the gold earrings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.”
2442	2	32	3	So all the people broke off the gold earrings that were on their ears and brought them to Aaron.
2443	2	32	4	He accepted the gold from them, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made a molten calf. Then they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.”
2444	2	32	5	¶When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it, and Aaron made a proclamation and said, “Tomorrow will be a feast to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
2445	2	32	6	So they got up early on the next day and offered up burnt offerings and brought peace offerings, and the people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.
2446	2	32	7	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses: “Go quickly, descend, because your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have acted corruptly.
2447	2	32	8	They have quickly turned aside from the way that I commanded them – they have made for themselves a molten calf and have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up from the land of Egypt.’”
2448	2	32	9	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses: “I have seen this people. Look what a stiff-necked people they are!
2449	2	32	10	So now, leave me alone so that my anger can burn against them and I can destroy them, and I will make from you a great nation.”
2450	2	32	11	¶But Moses sought the favor of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God and said, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, why does your anger burn against your people, whom you have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
2451	2	32	12	Why should the Egyptians say, ‘For evil he led them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your burning anger, and relent of this evil against your people.
2452	2	32	13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel your servants, to whom you swore by yourself and told them, ‘I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken about I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.’”
2453	2	32	14	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> relented over the evil that he had said he would do to his people.
2454	2	32	15	¶Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands. The tablets were written on both sides – they were written on the front and on the back.
2455	2	32	16	Now the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
2456	2	32	17	When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “It is the sound of war in the camp!”
2457	2	32	18	Moses said, “It is not the sound of those who shout for victory, nor is it the sound of those who cry because they are overcome, but the sound of singing I hear.”
2458	2	32	19	¶When he approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses became extremely angry. He threw the tablets from his hands and broke them to pieces at the bottom of the mountain.
2459	2	32	20	He took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire, ground it to powder, poured it out on the water, and made the Israelites drink it.
2460	2	32	21	¶Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you, that you have brought on them so great a sin?”
2461	2	32	22	Aaron said, “Do not let your anger burn hot, my lord; you know these people, that they tend to evil.
2462	2	32	23	They said to me, ‘Make us gods that will go before us, for as for this fellow Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’
2463	2	32	24	So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, break it off.’ So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out.”
2464	2	32	25	¶Moses saw that the people were running wild, for Aaron had let them get completely out of control, causing derision from their enemies.
2465	2	32	26	So Moses stood at the entrance of the camp and said, “Whoever is for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, come to me.” All the Levites gathered around him,
2466	2	32	27	and he said to them, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> the God of Israel, has said ‘Each man fasten his sword on his side, and go back and forth from entrance to entrance throughout the camp, and each one kill his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.’”
2467	2	32	28	¶The Levites did what Moses ordered, and that day about three thousand men of the people died.
2468	2	32	29	Moses said, “You have been consecrated today for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for each of you was against his son or against his brother, so he has given a blessing to you today.”
2469	2	32	30	¶The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a very serious sin, but now I will go up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – perhaps I can make atonement on behalf of your sin.”
2470	2	32	31	¶So Moses returned to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and said, “Alas, this people has committed a very serious sin, and they have made for themselves gods of gold.
2471	2	32	32	But now, if you will forgive their sin…, but if not, wipe me out from your book that you have written.”
2472	2	32	33	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me – that person I will wipe out of my book.
2473	2	32	34	So now go, lead the people to the place I have spoken to you about. See, my angel will go before you. But on the day that I punish, I will indeed punish them for their sin.”
2474	2	32	35	¶And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent a plague on the people because they had made the calf – the one Aaron made.
2475	2	33	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go up from here, you and the people whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’
2476	2	33	2	I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
2477	2	33	3	Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, and I might destroy you on the way.”
2478	2	33	4	¶When the people heard this troubling word they mourned; no one put on his ornaments.
2479	2	33	5	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I went up among you for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments, that I may know what I should do to you.’”
2480	2	33	6	So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments by Mount Horeb.
2481	2	33	7	¶Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp, at a good distance from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. Anyone seeking the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> would go out to the tent of meeting that was outside the camp.
2482	2	33	8	¶And when Moses went out to the tent, all the people would get up and stand at the entrance to their tents and watch Moses until he entered the tent.
2483	2	33	9	And whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> would speak with Moses.
2484	2	33	10	When all the people would see the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people, each one at the entrance of his own tent, would rise and worship.
2485	2	33	11	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> would speak to Moses face to face, the way a person speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his servant, Joshua son of Nun, a young man, did not leave the tent.
2486	2	33	12	¶Moses said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “See, you have been saying to me, ‘Bring this people up,’ but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. But you said, ‘I know you by name, and also you have found favor in my sight.’
2487	2	33	13	Now if I have found favor in your sight, show me your way, that I may know you, that I may continue to find favor in your sight. And see that this nation is your people.”
2488	2	33	14	¶And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
2489	2	33	15	¶And Moses said to him, “If your presence does not go with us, do not take us up from here.
2490	2	33	16	For how will it be known then that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Is it not by your going with us, so that we will be distinguished, I and your people, from all the people who are on the face of the earth?”
2491	2	33	17	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I will do this thing also that you have requested, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.”
2492	2	33	18	¶And Moses said, “Show me your glory.”
2493	2	33	19	¶And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “I will make all my goodness pass before your face, and I will proclaim the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by name before you; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy.”
2494	2	33	20	But he added, “You cannot see my face, for no one can see me and live.”
2495	2	33	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Here is a place by me; you will station yourself on a rock.
2496	2	33	22	When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and will cover you with my hand while I pass by.
2497	2	33	23	Then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back, but my face must not be seen.”
2498	2	34	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Cut out two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you smashed.
2499	2	34	2	Be prepared in the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and station yourself for me there on the top of the mountain.
2500	2	34	3	No one is to come up with you; do not let anyone be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks or the herds may graze in front of that mountain.”
2501	2	34	4	So Moses cut out two tablets of stone like the first; early in the morning he went up to Mount Sinai, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded him, and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.
2502	2	34	5	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by name.
2503	2	34	6	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> passed by before him and proclaimed: “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, and abounding in loyal love and faithfulness,
2504	2	34	7	keeping loyal love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin. But he by no means leaves the guilty unpunished, responding to the transgression of fathers by dealing with children and children’s children, to the third and fourth generation.”
2505	2	34	8	¶Moses quickly bowed to the ground and worshiped
2506	2	34	9	and said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, let my Lord go among us, for we are a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.”
2507	2	34	10	¶He said, “See, I am going to make a covenant before all your people. I will do wonders such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation. All the people among whom you live will see the work of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for it is a fearful thing that I am doing with you.
2508	2	34	11	¶“Obey what I am commanding you this day. I am going to drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
2509	2	34	12	Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it become a snare among you.
2510	2	34	13	Rather you must destroy their altars, smash their images, and cut down their Asherah poles.
2511	2	34	14	For you must not worship any other god, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
2512	2	34	15	Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone invites you, you will eat from his sacrifice;
2513	2	34	16	and you then take his daughters for your sons, and when his daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will make your sons prostitute themselves to their gods as well.
2514	2	34	17	You must not make yourselves molten gods.
2515	2	34	18	¶“You must keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you; do this at the appointed time of the month Abib, for in the month Abib you came out of Egypt.
2516	2	34	19	¶“Every firstborn of the womb belongs to me, even every firstborn of your cattle that is a male, whether ox or sheep.
2517	2	34	20	Now the firstling of a donkey you may redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then break its neck. You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons.¶“No one will appear before me empty-handed.
2518	2	34	21	¶“On six days you may labor, but on the seventh day you must rest; even at the time of plowing and of harvest you are to rest.
2519	2	34	22	¶“You must observe the Feast of Weeks – the firstfruits of the harvest of wheat – and the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year.
2520	2	34	23	At three times in the year all your men must appear before the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.
2521	2	34	24	For I will drive out the nations before you and enlarge your borders; no one will covet your land when you go up to appear before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God three times in the year.
2522	2	34	25	¶“You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice with yeast; the sacrifice from the Feast of Passover must not remain until the following morning.
2523	2	34	26	¶“The first of the firstfruits of your soil you must bring to the house of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.¶You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
2524	2	34	27	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
2525	2	34	28	So he was there with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
2526	2	34	29	¶Now when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand – when he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.
2527	2	34	30	When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to approach him.
2528	2	34	31	But Moses called to them, so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and Moses spoke to them.
2529	2	34	32	After this all the Israelites approached, and he commanded them all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had spoken to him on Mount Sinai.
2530	2	34	33	When Moses finished speaking with them, he would put a veil on his face.
2531	2	34	34	But when Moses went in before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to speak with him, he would remove the veil until he came out. Then he would come out and tell the Israelites what he had been commanded.
2532	2	34	35	When the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone, Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2533	2	35	1	¶Moses assembled the whole community of the Israelites and said to them, “These are the things that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded you to do.
2534	2	35	2	In six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there must be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of complete rest to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Anyone who does work on it will be put to death.
2535	2	35	3	You must not kindle a fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath day.”
2536	2	35	4	¶Moses spoke to the whole community of the Israelites, “This is the word that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded:
2537	2	35	5	‘Take an offering for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Let everyone who has a willing heart bring an offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: gold, silver, bronze,
2538	2	35	6	blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, fine linen, goat’s hair,
2539	2	35	7	ram skins dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood,
2540	2	35	8	olive oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,
2541	2	35	9	onyx stones, and other gems for mounting on the ephod and the breastpiece.
2542	2	35	10	Every skilled person among you is to come and make all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded:
2543	2	35	11	the tabernacle with its tent, its covering, its clasps, its frames, its crossbars, its posts, and its bases;
2544	2	35	12	the ark, with its poles, the atonement lid, and the special curtain that conceals it;
2545	2	35	13	the table with its poles and all its vessels, and the Bread of the Presence;
2546	2	35	14	the lampstand for the light and its accessories, its lamps, and oil for the light;
2547	2	35	15	and the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense; the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle;
2548	2	35	16	the altar for the burnt offering with its bronze grating that is on it, its poles, and all its utensils; the large basin and its pedestal;
2549	2	35	17	the hangings of the courtyard, its posts and its bases, and the curtain for the gateway to the courtyard;
2550	2	35	18	tent pegs for the tabernacle and tent pegs for the courtyard and their ropes;
2551	2	35	19	the woven garments for serving in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to minister as priests.”
2552	2	35	20	¶So the whole community of the Israelites went out from the presence of Moses.
2553	2	35	21	Everyone whose heart stirred him to action and everyone whose spirit was willing came and brought the offering for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for the work of the tent of meeting, for all its service, and for the holy garments.
2554	2	35	22	They came, men and women alike, all who had willing hearts. They brought brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments, all kinds of gold jewelry, and everyone came who waved a wave offering of gold to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2555	2	35	23	¶Everyone who had blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, fine linen, goats’ hair, ram skins dyed red, or fine leather brought them.
2556	2	35	24	Everyone making an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and everyone who had acacia wood for any work of the service brought it.
2557	2	35	25	Every woman who was skilled spun with her hands and brought what she had spun, blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen,
2558	2	35	26	and all the women whose heart stirred them to action and who were skilled spun goats’ hair.
2559	2	35	27	¶The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted for the ephod and the breastpiece,
2560	2	35	28	and spices and olive oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
2561	2	35	29	¶The Israelites brought a freewill offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, every man and woman whose heart was willing to bring materials for all the work that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> through Moses had commanded them to do.
2562	2	35	30	¶Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
2563	2	35	31	He has filled him with the Spirit of God – with skill, with understanding, with knowledge, and in all kinds of work,
2564	2	35	32	to design artistic designs, to work in gold, in silver, and in bronze,
2565	2	35	33	and in cutting stones for their setting, and in cutting wood, to do work in every artistic craft.
2566	2	35	34	And he has put it in his heart to teach, he and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
2567	2	35	35	He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as craftsmen, as designers, as embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and in fine linen, and as weavers. They are craftsmen in all the work and artistic designers.
2568	2	36	1	So Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person in whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has put skill and ability to know how to do all the work for the service of the sanctuary are to do the work according to all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded.”
2569	2	36	2	¶Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person in whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had put skill – everyone whose heart stirred him to volunteer to do the work,
2570	2	36	3	and they received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to do the work for the service of the sanctuary, and they still continued to bring him a freewill offering each morning.
2571	2	36	4	So all the skilled people who were doing all the work on the sanctuary came from the work they were doing
2572	2	36	5	and told Moses, “The people are bringing much more than is needed for the completion of the work which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded us to do!”
2573	2	36	6	¶Moses instructed them to take his message throughout the camp, saying, “Let no man or woman do any more work for the offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing any more.
2574	2	36	7	Now the materials were more than enough for them to do all the work.
2575	2	36	8	¶All the skilled among those who were doing the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet; they were made with cherubim that were the work of an artistic designer.
2576	2	36	9	The length of one curtain was forty-two feet, and the width of one curtain was six feet – the same size for each of the curtains.
2577	2	36	10	He joined five of the curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he joined to one another.
2578	2	36	11	He made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in the first set; he did the same along the edge of the end curtain in the second set.
2579	2	36	12	He made fifty loops on the first curtain, and he made fifty loops on the end curtain that was in the second set, with the loops opposite one another.
2580	2	36	13	He made fifty gold clasps and joined the curtains together to one another with the clasps, so that the tabernacle was a unit.
2581	2	36	14	¶He made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains.
2582	2	36	15	The length of one curtain was forty-five feet, and the width of one curtain was six feet – one size for all eleven curtains.
2583	2	36	16	He joined five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves.
2584	2	36	17	He made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set and fifty loops along the edge of the curtain that joined the second set.
2585	2	36	18	He made fifty bronze clasps to join the tent together so that it might be a unit.
2586	2	36	19	He made a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red and over that a covering of fine leather.
2587	2	36	20	¶He made the frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood as uprights.
2588	2	36	21	The length of each frame was fifteen feet, the width of each frame was two and a quarter feet,
2589	2	36	22	with two projections per frame parallel one to another. He made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
2590	2	36	23	So he made frames for the tabernacle: twenty frames for the south side.
2591	2	36	24	He made forty silver bases under the twenty frames – two bases under the first frame for its two projections, and likewise two bases under the next frame for its two projections,
2592	2	36	25	and for the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty frames
2593	2	36	26	and their forty silver bases, two bases under the first frame and two bases under the next frame.
2594	2	36	27	And for the back of the tabernacle on the west he made six frames.
2595	2	36	28	He made two frames for the corners of the tabernacle on the back.
2596	2	36	29	At the two corners they were doubled at the lower end and finished together at the top in one ring. So he did for both.
2597	2	36	30	So there were eight frames and their silver bases, sixteen bases, two bases under each frame.
2598	2	36	31	¶He made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle
2599	2	36	32	and five bars for the frames on the second side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle for the back side on the west.
2600	2	36	33	He made the middle bar to reach from end to end in the center of the frames.
2601	2	36	34	He overlaid the frames with gold and made their rings of gold to provide places for the bars, and he overlaid the bars with gold.
2602	2	36	35	¶He made the special curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine twisted linen; he made it with cherubim, the work of an artistic designer.
2603	2	36	36	He made for it four posts of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, with gold hooks, and he cast for them four silver bases.
2604	2	36	37	¶He made a hanging for the entrance of the tent of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer,
2605	2	36	38	and its five posts and their hooks. He overlaid their tops and their bands with gold, but their five bases were bronze.
2606	2	37	1	¶Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; its length was three feet nine inches, its width two feet three inches, and its height two feet three inches.
2607	2	37	2	He overlaid it with pure gold, inside and out, and he made a surrounding border of gold for it.
2608	2	37	3	He cast four gold rings for it that he put on its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other side.
2609	2	37	4	He made poles of acacia wood, overlaid them with gold,
2610	2	37	5	and put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark in order to carry the ark.
2611	2	37	6	¶He made an atonement lid of pure gold; its length was three feet nine inches, and its width was two feet three inches.
2612	2	37	7	He made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered metal on the two ends of the atonement lid,
2613	2	37	8	one cherub on one end and one cherub on the other end. He made the cherubim from the atonement lid on its two ends.
2614	2	37	9	The cherubim were spreading their wings upward, overshadowing the atonement lid with their wings. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the atonement lid.
2615	2	37	10	¶He made the table of acacia wood; its length was three feet, its width one foot six inches, and its height two feet three inches.
2616	2	37	11	He overlaid it with pure gold, and he made a surrounding border of gold for it.
2617	2	37	12	He made a surrounding frame for it about three inches wide, and he made a surrounding border of gold for its frame.
2618	2	37	13	He cast four gold rings for it and attached the rings at the four corners where its four legs were.
2619	2	37	14	The rings were close to the frame to provide places for the poles to carry the table.
2620	2	37	15	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table.
2621	2	37	16	He made the vessels which were on the table out of pure gold, its plates, its ladles, its pitchers, and its bowls, to be used in pouring out offerings.
2622	2	37	17	¶He made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered metal; its base and its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its blossoms were from the same piece.
2623	2	37	18	Six branches were extending from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from one side of it, and three branches of the lampstand from the other side of it.
2624	2	37	19	Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on the first branch, and three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on the next branch, and the same for the six branches that were extending from the lampstand.
2625	2	37	20	On the lampstand there were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms,
2626	2	37	21	with a bud under the first two branches from it, and a bud under the next two branches from it, and a bud under the third two branches from it; according to the six branches that extended from it.
2627	2	37	22	Their buds and their branches were of one piece; all of it was one hammered piece of pure gold.
2628	2	37	23	He made its seven lamps, its trimmers, and its trays of pure gold.
2629	2	37	24	He made the lampstand and all its accessories with seventy-five pounds of pure gold.
2630	2	37	25	¶He made the incense altar of acacia wood. Its length was a foot and a half and its width a foot and a half – a square – and its height was three feet. Its horns were of one piece with it.
2631	2	37	26	He overlaid it with pure gold – its top, its four walls, and its horns – and he made a surrounding border of gold for it.
2632	2	37	27	He also made two gold rings for it under its border, on its two sides, on opposite sides, as places for poles to carry it with.
2633	2	37	28	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
2634	2	37	29	¶He made the sacred anointing oil and the pure fragrant incense, the work of a perfumer.
2635	2	38	1	¶He made the altar for the burnt offering of acacia wood seven feet six inches long and seven feet six inches wide – it was square – and its height was four feet six inches.
2636	2	38	2	He made its horns on its four corners; its horns were part of it, and he overlaid it with bronze.
2637	2	38	3	He made all the utensils of the altar – the pots, the shovels, the tossing bowls, the meat hooks, and the fire pans – he made all its utensils of bronze.
2638	2	38	4	He made a grating for the altar, a network of bronze under its ledge, halfway up from the bottom.
2639	2	38	5	He cast four rings for the four corners of the bronze grating, to provide places for the poles.
2640	2	38	6	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
2641	2	38	7	He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made the altar hollow, out of boards.
2642	2	38	8	¶He made the large basin of bronze and its pedestal of bronze from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
2643	2	38	9	¶He made the courtyard. For the south side the hangings of the courtyard were of fine twisted linen, one hundred fifty feet long,
2644	2	38	10	with their twenty posts and their twenty bronze bases, with the hooks of the posts and their bands of silver.
2645	2	38	11	For the north side the hangings were one hundred fifty feet, with their twenty posts and their twenty bronze bases, with the hooks of the posts and their bands of silver.
2646	2	38	12	For the west side there were hangings seventy-five feet long, with their ten posts and their ten bases, with the hooks of the posts and their bands of silver.
2647	2	38	13	For the east side, toward the sunrise, it was seventy-five feet wide,
2648	2	38	14	with hangings on one side of the gate that were twenty-two and a half feet long, with their three posts and their three bases,
2649	2	38	15	and for the second side of the gate of the courtyard, just like the other, the hangings were twenty-two and a half feet long, with their three posts and their three bases.
2650	2	38	16	All the hangings around the courtyard were of fine twisted linen.
2651	2	38	17	The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks of the posts and their bands were silver, their tops were overlaid with silver, and all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands.
2652	2	38	18	The curtain for the gate of the courtyard was of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer. It was thirty feet long, and like the hangings in the courtyard, it was seven and a half feet high,
2653	2	38	19	with four posts and their four bronze bases. Their hooks and their bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver.
2654	2	38	20	All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the courtyard all around were bronze.
2655	2	38	21	¶This is the inventory of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, which was counted by the order of Moses, being the work of the Levites under the direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.
2656	2	38	22	Now Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses;
2657	2	38	23	and with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an artisan, a designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen.
2658	2	38	24	¶All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the sanctuary (namely, the gold of the wave offering) was twenty-nine talents and 730 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
2659	2	38	25	¶The silver of those who were numbered of the community was one hundred talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel,
2660	2	38	26	one beka per person, that is, a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, for everyone who crossed over to those numbered, from twenty years old or older, 603,550 in all.
2661	2	38	27	The one hundred talents of silver were used for casting the bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the special curtain – one hundred bases for one hundred talents, one talent per base.
2662	2	38	28	From the remaining 1,775 shekels he made hooks for the posts, overlaid their tops, and made bands for them.
2663	2	38	29	¶The bronze of the wave offering was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels.
2664	2	38	30	With it he made the bases for the door of the tent of meeting, the bronze altar, the bronze grating for it, and all the utensils of the altar,
2665	2	38	31	the bases for the courtyard all around, the bases for the gate of the courtyard, all the tent pegs of the tabernacle, and all the tent pegs of the courtyard all around.
2666	2	39	1	¶From the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for serving in the sanctuary; they made holy garments that were for Aaron, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2667	2	39	2	¶He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen.
2668	2	39	3	They hammered the gold into thin sheets and cut it into narrow strips to weave them into the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and into the fine linen, the work of an artistic designer.
2669	2	39	4	They made shoulder pieces for it, attached to two of its corners, so it could be joined together.
2670	2	39	5	The artistically woven waistband of the ephod that was on it was like it, of one piece with it, of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine twisted linen, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2671	2	39	6	¶They set the onyx stones in gold filigree settings, engraved as with the engravings of a seal with the names of the sons of Israel.
2672	2	39	7	He put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as stones of memorial for the Israelites, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2673	2	39	8	¶He made the breastpiece, the work of an artistic designer, in the same fashion as the ephod, of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine twisted linen.
2674	2	39	9	It was square – they made the breastpiece doubled, nine inches long and nine inches wide when doubled.
2675	2	39	10	They set on it four rows of stones: a row with a ruby, a topaz, and a beryl – the first row;
2676	2	39	11	and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and an emerald;
2677	2	39	12	and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
2678	2	39	13	and the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in gold filigree settings.
2679	2	39	14	The stones were for the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, corresponding to the number of their names. Each name corresponding to one of the twelve tribes was like the engravings of a seal.
2680	2	39	15	¶They made for the breastpiece braided chains like cords of pure gold,
2681	2	39	16	and they made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and they attached the two rings to the upper two ends of the breastpiece.
2682	2	39	17	They attached the two gold chains to the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece;
2683	2	39	18	the other two ends of the two chains they attached to the two settings, and they attached them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it.
2684	2	39	19	They made two rings of gold and put them on the other two ends of the breastpiece on its edge, which is on the inner side of the ephod.
2685	2	39	20	They made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the juncture above the waistband of the ephod.
2686	2	39	21	They tied the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod by blue cord, so that it was above the waistband of the ephod, so that the breastpiece would not be loose from the ephod, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2687	2	39	22	¶He made the robe of the ephod completely blue, the work of a weaver.
2688	2	39	23	There was an opening in the center of the robe, like the opening of a collar, with an edge all around the opening so that it could not be torn.
2689	2	39	24	They made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and twisted linen around the hem of the robe.
2690	2	39	25	They made bells of pure gold and attached the bells between the pomegranates around the hem of the robe between the pomegranates.
2691	2	39	26	There was a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the robe, to be used in ministering, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2692	2	39	27	¶They made tunics of fine linen – the work of a weaver, for Aaron and for his sons –
2693	2	39	28	and the turban of fine linen, the headbands of fine linen, and the undergarments of fine twisted linen.
2694	2	39	29	The sash was of fine twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, the work of an embroiderer, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2695	2	39	30	They made a plate, the holy diadem, of pure gold and wrote on it an inscription, as on the engravings of a seal, “Holiness to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
2696	2	39	31	They attached to it a blue cord, to attach it to the turban above, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2697	2	39	32	¶So all the work of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed, and the Israelites did according to all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses – they did it exactly so.
2698	2	39	33	They brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings, clasps, frames, bars, posts, and bases;
2699	2	39	34	and the coverings of ram skins dyed red, the covering of fine leather, and the protecting curtain;
2700	2	39	35	the ark of the testimony and its poles, and the atonement lid;
2701	2	39	36	the table, all its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence;
2702	2	39	37	the pure lampstand, its lamps, with the lamps set in order, and all its accessories, and oil for the light;
2703	2	39	38	and the gold altar, and the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense; and the curtain for the entrance to the tent;
2704	2	39	39	the bronze altar and its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils; the large basin with its pedestal;
2705	2	39	40	the hangings of the courtyard, its posts and its bases, and the curtain for the gateway of the courtyard, its ropes and its tent pegs, and all the furnishings for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
2706	2	39	41	the woven garments for serving in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to minister as priests.
2707	2	39	42	¶The Israelites did all the work according to all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2708	2	39	43	Moses inspected all the work – and they had done it just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded – they had done it exactly – and Moses blessed them.
2709	2	40	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
2710	2	40	2	“On the first day of the first month you are to set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.
2711	2	40	3	You are to place the ark of the testimony in it and shield the ark with the special curtain.
2712	2	40	4	You are to bring in the table and set out the things that belong on it; then you are to bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.
2713	2	40	5	You are to put the gold altar for incense in front of the ark of the testimony and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
2714	2	40	6	You are to put the altar for the burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.
2715	2	40	7	You are to put the large basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it.
2716	2	40	8	You are to set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the gate of the courtyard.
2717	2	40	9	And take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and sanctify it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy.
2718	2	40	10	Then you are to anoint the altar for the burnt offering with all its utensils; you are to sanctify the altar, and it will be the most holy altar.
2719	2	40	11	You must also anoint the large basin and its pedestal, and you are to sanctify it.
2720	2	40	12	¶“You are to bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
2721	2	40	13	Then you are to clothe Aaron with the holy garments and anoint him and sanctify him so that he may minister as my priest.
2722	2	40	14	You are to bring his sons and clothe them with tunics
2723	2	40	15	and anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they may minister as my priests; their anointing will make them a priesthood that will continue throughout their generations.”
2724	2	40	16	This is what Moses did, according to all the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded him – so he did.
2725	2	40	17	¶So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month, in the second year.
2726	2	40	18	When Moses set up the tabernacle and put its bases in place, he set up its frames, attached its bars, and set up its posts.
2727	2	40	19	Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent over it, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2728	2	40	20	He took the testimony and put it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark, and then put the atonement lid on the ark.
2729	2	40	21	And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, hung the protecting curtain, and shielded the ark of the testimony from view, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2730	2	40	22	¶And he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain.
2731	2	40	23	And he set the bread in order on it before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2732	2	40	24	¶And he put the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle.
2733	2	40	25	Then he set up the lamps before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2734	2	40	26	¶And he put the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain,
2735	2	40	27	and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2736	2	40	28	¶Then he put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
2737	2	40	29	He also put the altar for the burnt offering by the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2738	2	40	30	¶Then he put the large basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.
2739	2	40	31	Moses and Aaron and his sons would wash their hands and their feet from it.
2740	2	40	32	Whenever they entered the tent of meeting, and whenever they approached the altar, they would wash, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2741	2	40	33	¶And he set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar, and put the curtain at the gate of the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.
2742	2	40	34	¶Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> filled the tabernacle.
2743	2	40	35	Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it and the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> filled the tabernacle.
2744	2	40	36	But when the cloud was lifted up from the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out on all their journeys;
2745	2	40	37	but if the cloud was not lifted up, then they would not journey further until the day it was lifted up.
2746	2	40	38	For the cloud of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was on the tabernacle by day, but fire would be on it at night, in plain view of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
2747	3	1	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> called to Moses and spoke to him from the Meeting Tent:
2748	3	1	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When someone among you presents an offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you must present your offering from the domesticated animals, either from the herd or from the flock.
2749	3	1	3	¶“‘If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd he must present it as a flawless male; he must present it at the entrance of the Meeting Tent for its acceptance before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
2750	3	1	4	He must lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted for him to make atonement on his behalf.
2751	3	1	5	Then the one presenting the offering must slaughter the bull before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> and the sons of Aaron, the priests, must present the blood and splash the blood against the sides of the altar which is at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.
2752	3	1	6	Next, the one presenting the offering must skin the burnt offering and cut it into parts,
2753	3	1	7	and the sons of Aaron, the priest, must put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
2754	3	1	8	Then the sons of Aaron, the priests, must arrange the parts with the head and the suet on the wood that is in the fire on the altar.
2755	3	1	9	Finally, the one presenting the offering must wash its entrails and its legs in water and the priest must offer all of it up in smoke on the altar – it is a burnt offering, a gift of a soothing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
2756	3	1	10	¶“‘If his offering is from the flock for a burnt offering – from the sheep or the goats – he must present a flawless male,
2757	3	1	11	and must slaughter it on the north side of the altar before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the sons of Aaron, the priests, will splash its blood against the altar’s sides.
2758	3	1	12	Next, the one presenting the offering must cut it into parts, with its head and its suet, and the priest must arrange them on the wood which is in the fire, on the altar.
2759	3	1	13	Then the one presenting the offering must wash the entrails and the legs in water, and the priest must present all of it and offer it up in smoke on the altar – it is a burnt offering, a gift of a soothing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
2760	3	1	14	¶“‘If his offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is a burnt offering from the birds, he must present his offering from the turtledoves or from the young pigeons.
2761	3	1	15	The priest must present it at the altar, pinch off its head and offer the head up in smoke on the altar, and its blood must be drained out against the side of the altar.
2762	3	1	16	Then the priest must remove its entrails by cutting off its tail feathers, and throw them to the east side of the altar into the place of fatty ashes,
2763	3	1	17	and tear it open by its wings without dividing it into two parts. Finally, the priest must offer it up in smoke on the altar on the wood which is in the fire – it is a burnt offering, a gift of a soothing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2764	3	2	1	¶“‘When a person presents a grain offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, his offering must consist of choice wheat flour, and he must pour olive oil on it and put frankincense on it.
2765	3	2	2	Then he must bring it to the sons of Aaron, the priests, and the priest must scoop out from there a handful of its choice wheat flour and some of its olive oil in addition to all of its frankincense, and the priest must offer its memorial portion up in smoke on the altar – it is a gift of a soothing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2766	3	2	3	The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and to his sons – it is most holy from the gifts of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2767	3	2	4	¶“‘When you present an offering of grain baked in an oven, it must be made of choice wheat flour baked into unleavened loaves mixed with olive oil or unleavened wafers smeared with olive oil.
2768	3	2	5	If your offering is a grain offering made on the griddle, it must be choice wheat flour mixed with olive oil, unleavened.
2769	3	2	6	Crumble it in pieces and pour olive oil on it – it is a grain offering.
2770	3	2	7	If your offering is a grain offering made in a pan, it must be made of choice wheat flour deep fried in olive oil.
2771	3	2	8	¶“‘You must bring the grain offering that must be made from these to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Present it to the priest, and he will bring it to the altar.
2772	3	2	9	Then the priest must take up from the grain offering its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar – it is a gift of a soothing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2773	3	2	10	The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and to his sons – it is most holy from the gifts of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2774	3	2	11	¶“‘No grain offering which you present to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> can be made with yeast, for you must not offer up in smoke any yeast or honey as a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2775	3	2	12	You can present them to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as an offering of first fruit, but they must not go up to the altar for a soothing aroma.
2776	3	2	13	Moreover, you must season every one of your grain offerings with salt; you must not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing from your grain offering – on every one of your grain offerings you must present salt.
2777	3	2	14	¶“‘If you present a grain offering of first ripe grain to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you must present your grain offering of first ripe grain as soft kernels roasted in fire – crushed bits of fresh grain.
2778	3	2	15	And you must put olive oil on it and set frankincense on it – it is a grain offering.
2779	3	2	16	Then the priest must offer its memorial portion up in smoke – some of its crushed bits, some of its olive oil, in addition to all of its frankincense – it is a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2780	3	3	1	¶“‘Now if his offering is a peace offering sacrifice, if he presents an offering from the herd, he must present before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> a flawless male or a female.
2781	3	3	2	He must lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it at the entrance of the Meeting Tent, and the sons of Aaron, the priests, must splash the blood against the altar’s sides.
2782	3	3	3	Then the one presenting the offering must present a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from the peace offering sacrifice: He must remove the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that surrounds the entrails,
2783	3	3	4	the two kidneys with the fat on their sinews, and the protruding lobe on the liver (which he is to remove along with the kidneys).
2784	3	3	5	Then the sons of Aaron must offer it up in smoke on the altar atop the burnt offering that is on the wood in the fire as a gift of a soothing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2785	3	3	6	¶“‘If his offering for a peace offering sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is from the flock, he must present a flawless male or female.

2787	3	3	8	He must lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it before the Meeting Tent, and the sons of Aaron must splash its blood against the altar’s sides.
2788	3	3	9	Then he must present a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from the peace offering sacrifice: He must remove all the fatty tail up to the end of the spine, the fat covering the entrails, and all the fat on the entrails,
2789	3	3	10	the two kidneys with the fat on their sinews, and the protruding lobe on the liver (which he is to remove along with the kidneys).
2790	3	3	11	Then the priest must offer it up in smoke on the altar as a food gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2791	3	3	12	¶“‘If his offering is a goat he must present it before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
2792	3	3	13	lay his hand on its head, and slaughter it before the Meeting Tent, and the sons of Aaron must splash its blood against the altar’s sides.
2793	3	3	14	Then he must present from it his offering as a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: the fat which covers the entrails and all the fat on the entrails,
2794	3	3	15	the two kidneys with the fat on their sinews, and the protruding lobe on the liver (which he is to remove along with the kidneys).
2795	3	3	16	Then the priest must offer them up in smoke on the altar as a food gift for a soothing aroma – all the fat belongs to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2796	3	3	17	This is a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all the places where you live: You must never eat any fat or any blood.’”
2797	3	4	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
2798	3	4	2	“Tell the Israelites, ‘When a person sins by straying unintentionally from any of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commandments which must not be violated, and violates any one of them –
2799	3	4	3	¶“‘If the high priest sins so that the people are guilty, on account of the sin he has committed he must present a flawless young bull to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for a sin offering.
2800	3	4	4	He must bring the bull to the entrance of the Meeting Tent before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, lay his hand on the head of the bull, and slaughter the bull before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2801	3	4	5	Then that high priest must take some of the blood of the bull and bring it to the Meeting Tent.
2802	3	4	6	The priest must dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> toward the front of the special curtain of the sanctuary.
2803	3	4	7	The priest must put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the Meeting Tent, and all the rest of the bull’s blood he must pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.
2804	3	4	8	¶“‘Then he must take up all the fat from the sin offering bull: the fat covering the entrails and all the fat surrounding the entrails,
2805	3	4	9	the two kidneys with the fat on their sinews, and the protruding lobe on the liver (which he is to remove along with the kidneys)
2806	3	4	10	– just as it is taken from the ox of the peace offering sacrifice – and the priest must offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering.
2807	3	4	11	But the hide of the bull, all its flesh along with its head and its legs, its entrails, and its dung –
2808	3	4	12	all the rest of the bull – he must bring outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place, to the fatty ash pile, and he must burn it on a wood fire; it must be burned on the fatty ash pile.
2809	3	4	13	¶“‘If the whole congregation of Israel strays unintentionally and the matter is not noticed by the assembly, and they violate one of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commandments, which must not be violated, so they become guilty,
2810	3	4	14	the assembly must present a young bull for a sin offering when the sin they have committed becomes known. They must bring it before the Meeting Tent,
2811	3	4	15	the elders of the congregation must lay their hands on the head of the bull before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and someone must slaughter the bull before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.

2815	3	4	19	¶“‘Then the priest must take all its fat and offer the fat up in smoke on the altar.
2816	3	4	20	He must do with the rest of the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering; this is what he must do with it. So the priest will make atonement on their behalf and they will be forgiven.
2817	3	4	21	He must bring the rest of the bull outside the camp and burn it just as he burned the first bull – it is the sin offering of the assembly.
2818	3	4	22	¶“‘Whenever a leader, by straying unintentionally, sins and violates one of the commandments of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God which must not be violated, and he pleads guilty,

2834	3	5	3	or when he touches human uncleanness with regard to anything by which he can become unclean, even if he did not realize it, but he himself has later come to know it and is guilty;
2835	3	5	4	or when a person swears an oath, speaking thoughtlessly with his lips, whether to do evil or to do good, with regard to anything which the individual might speak thoughtlessly in an oath, even if he did not realize it, but he himself has later come to know it and is guilty with regard to one of these oaths –
2836	3	5	5	when an individual becomes guilty with regard to one of these things he must confess how he has sinned,
2837	3	5	6	and he must bring his penalty for guilt to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for his sin that he has committed, a female from the flock, whether a female sheep or a female goat, for a sin offering. So the priest will make atonement on his behalf for his sin.
2838	3	5	7	¶“‘If he cannot afford an animal from the flock, he must bring his penalty for guilt for his sin that he has committed, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering.

2840	3	5	9	Then he must sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the wall of the altar, and the remainder of the blood must be squeezed out at the base of the altar – it is a sin offering.
2841	3	5	10	The second bird he must make a burnt offering according to the standard regulation. So the priest will make atonement on behalf of this person for his sin which he has committed, and he will be forgiven.
2842	3	5	11	¶“‘If he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he must bring as his offering for his sin which he has committed a tenth of an ephah of choice wheat flour for a sin offering.

2850	3	5	19	It is a guilt offering; he was surely guilty before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
2851	3	6	1	¶(5:20) Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:

2854	3	6	4	when it happens that he sins and he is found guilty, then he must return whatever he had stolen, or whatever he had extorted, or the thing that he had held in trust, or the lost thing that he had found,
2855	3	6	5	or anything about which he swears falsely. He must restore it in full and add one fifth to it; he must give it to its owner when he is found guilty.
2856	3	6	6	Then he must bring his guilt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, a flawless ram from the flock, convertible into silver shekels, for a guilt offering to the priest.
2857	3	6	7	So the priest will make atonement on his behalf before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and he will be forgiven for whatever he has done to become guilty.”
2858	3	6	8	¶(6:1) Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:

2861	3	6	11	Then he must take off his clothes and put on other clothes, and he must bring the fatty ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place,
2862	3	6	12	but the fire which is on the altar must be kept burning on it. It must not be extinguished. So the priest must kindle wood on it morning by morning, and he must arrange the burnt offering on it and offer the fat of the peace offering up in smoke on it.

2897	3	7	17	but the leftovers from the meat of the sacrifice must be burned up in the fire on the third day.
2898	3	7	18	If some of the meat of his peace offering sacrifice is ever eaten on the third day it will not be accepted; it will not be accounted to the one who presented it, since it is spoiled, and the person who eats from it will bear his punishment for iniquity.
2899	3	7	19	The meat which touches anything ceremonially unclean must not be eaten; it must be burned up in the fire. As for ceremonially clean meat, everyone who is ceremonially clean may eat the meat.
2900	3	7	20	The person who eats meat from the peace offering sacrifice which belongs to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> while his uncleanness persists will be cut off from his people.
2901	3	7	21	When a person touches anything unclean (whether human uncleanness, or an unclean animal, or an unclean detestable creature) and eats some of the meat of the peace offering sacrifice which belongs to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, that person will be cut off from his people.’”
2902	3	7	22	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
2903	3	7	23	“Tell the Israelites, ‘You must not eat any fat of an ox, sheep, or goat.
2904	3	7	24	Moreover, the fat of an animal that has died of natural causes and the fat of an animal torn by beasts may be used for any other purpose, but you must certainly never eat it.
2905	3	7	25	If anyone eats fat from the animal from which he presents a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, that person will be cut off from his people.
2906	3	7	26	And you must not eat any blood of the birds or the domesticated land animals in any of the places where you live.
2907	3	7	27	Any person who eats any blood – that person will be cut off from his people.’”
2908	3	7	28	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
2909	3	7	29	“Tell the Israelites, ‘The one who presents his peace offering sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> must bring his offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from his peace offering sacrifice.
2910	3	7	30	With his own hands he must bring the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s gifts. He must bring the fat with the breast to wave the breast as a wave offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
2911	3	7	31	and the priest must offer the fat up in smoke on the altar, but the breast will belong to Aaron and his sons.
2912	3	7	32	The right thigh you must give as a contribution offering to the priest from your peace offering sacrifices.
2913	3	7	33	The one from Aaron’s sons who presents the blood of the peace offering and fat will have the right thigh as his share,
2914	3	7	34	for the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution offering I have taken from the Israelites out of their peace offering sacrifices and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons from the people of Israel as a perpetual allotted portion.’”
2915	3	7	35	¶This is the allotment of Aaron and the allotment of his sons from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s gifts on the day Moses presented them to serve as priests to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2916	3	7	36	This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded to give to them from the Israelites on the day Moses anointed them – a perpetual allotted portion throughout their generations.
2917	3	7	37	¶This is the law for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering, and the peace offering sacrifice,
2918	3	7	38	which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day he commanded the Israelites to present their offerings to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the desert of Sinai.
2919	3	8	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
2920	3	8	2	“Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, the anointing oil, the sin offering bull, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,
2921	3	8	3	and assemble the whole congregation at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.”
2922	3	8	4	So Moses did just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded him, and the congregation assembled at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.
2923	3	8	5	Then Moses said to the congregation: “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded to be done.”
2924	3	8	6	¶So Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.
2925	3	8	7	Then he put the tunic on Aaron, wrapped the sash around him, and clothed him with the robe. Next he put the ephod on him and placed on him the decorated band of the ephod, and fastened the ephod closely to him with the band.
2926	3	8	8	He then set the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim into the breastpiece.
2927	3	8	9	Finally, he set the turban on his head and attached the gold plate, the holy diadem, to the front of the turban just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2928	3	8	10	¶Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them.
2929	3	8	11	Next he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and so anointed the altar, all its vessels, and the washbasin and its stand to consecrate them.
2930	3	8	12	He then poured some of the anointing oil on the head of Aaron and anointed him to consecrate him.
2931	3	8	13	Moses also brought forward Aaron’s sons, clothed them with tunics, wrapped sashes around them, and wrapped headbands on them just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2932	3	8	14	¶Then he brought near the sin offering bull and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the sin offering bull,
2933	3	8	15	and he slaughtered it. Moses then took the blood and put it all around on the horns of the altar with his finger and purified the altar, and he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and so consecrated it to make atonement on it.
2934	3	8	16	Then he took all the fat on the entrails, the protruding lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses offered it all up in smoke on the altar,
2935	3	8	17	but the rest of the bull – its hide, its flesh, and its dung – he completely burned up outside the camp just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2936	3	8	18	¶Then he presented the burnt offering ram and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,
2937	3	8	19	and he slaughtered it. Moses then splashed the blood against the altar’s sides.
2938	3	8	20	Then he cut the ram into parts, and Moses offered the head, the parts, and the suet up in smoke,
2939	3	8	21	but the entrails and the legs he washed with water, and Moses offered the whole ram up in smoke on the altar – it was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma, a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2940	3	8	22	¶Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram
2941	3	8	23	and he slaughtered it. Moses then took some of its blood and put it on Aaron’s right earlobe, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
2942	3	8	24	Next he brought Aaron’s sons forward, and Moses put some of the blood on their right earlobes, on their right thumbs, and on the big toes of their right feet, and Moses splashed the rest of the blood against the altar’s sides.
2943	3	8	25	¶Then he took the fat (the fatty tail, all the fat on the entrails, the protruding lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat) and the right thigh,
2944	3	8	26	and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> he took one unleavened loaf, one loaf of bread mixed with olive oil, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat parts and on the right thigh.
2945	3	8	27	He then put all of them on the palms of Aaron and his sons, who waved them as a wave offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2946	3	8	28	Moses then took them from their palms and offered them up in smoke on the altar on top of the burnt offering – they were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma; it was a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2947	3	8	29	Finally, Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from the ram of ordination. It was Moses’ share just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
2948	3	8	30	¶Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and his sons’ garments with him. So he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.
2949	3	8	31	Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance of the Meeting Tent, and there you are to eat it and the bread which is in the ordination offering basket, just as I have commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it,’
2950	3	8	32	but the remainder of the meat and the bread you must burn with fire.
2951	3	8	33	And you must not go out from the entrance of the Meeting Tent for seven days, until the day when your days of ordination are completed, because you must be ordained over a seven-day period.
2952	3	8	34	What has been done on this day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded to be done to make atonement for you.
2953	3	8	35	You must reside at the entrance of the Meeting Tent day and night for seven days and keep the charge of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> so that you will not die, for this is what I have been commanded.”
2954	3	8	36	So Aaron and his sons did all the things the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded through Moses.
2955	3	9	1	¶On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel,
2956	3	9	2	and said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both flawless, and present them before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2957	3	9	3	Then tell the Israelites: ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and lamb, both a year old and flawless, for a burnt offering,
2958	3	9	4	and an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and a grain offering mixed with olive oil, for today the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is going to appear to you.’”
2959	3	9	5	So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the Meeting Tent and the whole congregation presented them and stood before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2960	3	9	6	Then Moses said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded you to do so that the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> may appear to you.”
2961	3	9	7	Moses then said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and make your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement on behalf of yourself and on behalf of the people; and also make the people’s offering and make atonement on behalf of them just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded.”
2962	3	9	8	¶So Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the sin offering calf which was for himself.
2963	3	9	9	Then Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar, and the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.
2964	3	9	10	The fat and the kidneys and the protruding lobe of the liver from the sin offering he offered up in smoke on the altar just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses,
2965	3	9	11	but the flesh and the hide he completely burned up outside the camp.
2966	3	9	12	¶He then slaughtered the burnt offering, and his sons handed the blood to him and he splashed it against the altar’s sides.
2967	3	9	13	The burnt offering itself they handed to him by its parts, including the head, and he offered them up in smoke on the altar,
2968	3	9	14	and he washed the entrails and the legs and offered them up in smoke on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
2969	3	9	15	¶Then he presented the people’s offering. He took the sin offering male goat which was for the people, slaughtered it, and performed a purification rite with it like the first one.
2970	3	9	16	He then presented the burnt offering, and did it according to the standard regulation.
2971	3	9	17	Next he presented the grain offering, filled his hand with some of it, and offered it up in smoke on the altar in addition to the morning burnt offering.
2972	3	9	18	Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram – the peace offering sacrifices which were for the people – and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he splashed it against the altar’s sides.
2973	3	9	19	As for the fat parts from the ox and from the ram (the fatty tail, the fat covering the entrails, the kidneys, and the protruding lobe of the liver),
2974	3	9	20	they set those on the breasts and he offered the fat parts up in smoke on the altar.
2975	3	9	21	Finally Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> just as Moses had commanded.
2976	3	9	22	¶Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them and descended from making the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering.
2977	3	9	23	Moses and Aaron then entered into the Meeting Tent. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to all the people.
2978	3	9	24	Then fire went out from the presence of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and consumed the burnt offering and the fat parts on the altar, and all the people saw it, so they shouted loudly and fell down with their faces to the ground.
2979	3	10	1	¶Then Aaron’s sons, Nadab and Abihu, each took his fire pan and put fire in it, set incense on it, and presented strange fire before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, which he had not commanded them to do.
2980	3	10	2	So fire went out from the presence of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and consumed them so that they died before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2981	3	10	3	Moses then said to Aaron, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke: ‘Among the ones close to me I will show myself holy, and in the presence of all the people I will be honored.’” So Aaron kept silent.
2982	3	10	4	Moses then called to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron’s uncle, and said to them, “Come near, carry your brothers from the front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp.”
2983	3	10	5	So they came near and carried them away in their tunics to a place outside the camp just as Moses had spoken.
2984	3	10	6	Then Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his other two sons, “Do not dishevel the hair of your heads and do not tear your garments, so that you do not die and so that wrath does not come on the whole congregation. Your brothers, all the house of Israel, are to mourn the burning which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has caused,
2985	3	10	7	but you must not go out from the entrance of the Meeting Tent lest you die, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anointing oil is on you.” So they acted according to the word of Moses.
2986	3	10	8	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Aaron,
2987	3	10	9	“Do not drink wine or strong drink, you and your sons with you, when you enter into the Meeting Tent, so that you do not die, which is a perpetual statute throughout your generations,
2988	3	10	10	as well as to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,
2989	3	10	11	and to teach the Israelites all the statutes that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken to them through Moses.”
2990	3	10	12	¶Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his remaining sons, “Take the grain offering which remains from the gifts of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.
2991	3	10	13	You must eat it in a holy place because it is your allotted portion and the allotted portion of your sons from the gifts of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for this is what I have been commanded.
2992	3	10	14	Also, the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution offering you must eat in a ceremonially clean place, you and your sons and daughters with you, for they have been given as your allotted portion and the allotted portion of your sons from the peace offering sacrifices of the Israelites.
2993	3	10	15	The thigh of the contribution offering and the breast of the wave offering they must bring in addition to the gifts of the fat parts to wave them as a wave offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and it will belong to you and your sons with you for a perpetual statute just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded.”
2994	3	10	16	¶Later Moses sought diligently for the sin offering male goat, but it had actually been burnt. So he became angry at Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, saying,
2995	3	10	17	“Why did you not eat the sin offering in the sanctuary? For it is most holy and he gave it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement on their behalf before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
2996	3	10	18	See here! Its blood was not brought into the holy place within! You should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary just as I commanded!”
2997	3	10	19	But Aaron spoke to Moses, “See here! Just today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and such things as these have happened to me! If I had eaten a sin offering today would the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> have been pleased?”
2998	3	10	20	When Moses heard this explanation, he was satisfied.
2999	3	11	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them,
3000	3	11	2	“Tell the Israelites: ‘This is the kind of creature you may eat from among all the animals that are on the land.
3001	3	11	3	You may eat any among the animals that has a divided hoof (the hooves are completely split in two) and that also chews the cud.
3002	3	11	4	However, you must not eat these from among those that chew the cud and have divided hooves: The camel is unclean to you because it chews the cud even though its hoof is not divided.
3003	3	11	5	The rock badger is unclean to you because it chews the cud even though its hoof is not divided.
3004	3	11	6	The hare is unclean to you because it chews the cud even though its hoof is not divided.
3005	3	11	7	The pig is unclean to you because its hoof is divided (the hoof is completely split in two), even though it does not chew the cud.
3006	3	11	8	You must not eat from their meat and you must not touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.
3007	3	11	9	¶“‘These you can eat from all creatures that are in the water: Any creatures in the water that have both fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the streams, you may eat.
3008	3	11	10	But any creatures that do not have both fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the streams, from all the swarming things of the water and from all the living creatures that are in the water, are detestable to you.
3009	3	11	11	Since they are detestable to you, you must not eat their meat and their carcass you must detest.
3010	3	11	12	Any creature in the water that does not have both fins and scales is detestable to you.
3011	3	11	13	¶“‘These you are to detest from among the birds – they must not be eaten, because they are detestable: the griffon vulture, the bearded vulture, the black vulture,
3012	3	11	14	the kite, the buzzard of any kind,
3013	3	11	15	every kind of crow,
3014	3	11	16	the eagle owl, the short-eared owl, the long-eared owl, the hawk of any kind,
3015	3	11	17	the little owl, the cormorant, the screech owl,
3016	3	11	18	the white owl, the scops owl, the osprey,
3017	3	11	19	the stork, the heron of any kind, the hoopoe, and the bat.
3018	3	11	20	¶“‘Every winged swarming thing that walks on all fours is detestable to you.
3019	3	11	21	However, this you may eat from all the winged swarming things that walk on all fours, which have jointed legs to hop with on the land.
3020	3	11	22	These you may eat from them: the locust of any kind, the bald locust of any kind, the cricket of any kind, the grasshopper of any kind.
3021	3	11	23	But any other winged swarming thing that has four legs is detestable to you.
3022	3	11	24	¶“‘By these you defile yourselves; anyone who touches their carcass will be unclean until the evening,
3023	3	11	25	and anyone who carries their carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until the evening.
3024	3	11	26	¶“‘All animals that divide the hoof but it is not completely split in two and do not chew the cud are unclean to you; anyone who touches them becomes unclean.
3025	3	11	27	All that walk on their paws among all the creatures that walk on all fours are unclean to you. Anyone who touches their carcass will be unclean until the evening,
3026	3	11	28	and the one who carries their carcass must wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.
3027	3	11	29	¶“‘Now this is what is unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the land: the rat, the mouse, the large lizard of any kind,
3028	3	11	30	the Mediterranean gecko, the spotted lizard, the wall gecko, the skink, and the chameleon.
3029	3	11	31	These are the ones that are unclean to you among all the swarming things. Anyone who touches them when they die will be unclean until evening.
3030	3	11	32	Also, anything they fall on when they die will become unclean – any wood vessel or garment or article of leather or sackcloth. Any such vessel with which work is done must be immersed in water and will be unclean until the evening. Then it will become clean.
3031	3	11	33	As for any clay vessel they fall into, everything in it will become unclean and you must break it.
3032	3	11	34	Any food that may be eaten which becomes soaked with water will become unclean. Anything drinkable in any such vessel will become unclean.
3033	3	11	35	Anything their carcass may fall on will become unclean. An oven or small stove must be smashed to pieces; they are unclean, and they will stay unclean to you.
3034	3	11	36	However, a spring or a cistern which collects water will be clean, but one who touches their carcass will be unclean.
3035	3	11	37	Now, if such a carcass falls on any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean,
3036	3	11	38	but if water is put on the seed and such a carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.
3037	3	11	39	¶“‘Now if an animal that you may eat dies, whoever touches its carcass will be unclean until the evening.
3038	3	11	40	One who eats from its carcass must wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening, and whoever carries its carcass must wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
3039	3	11	41	Every swarming thing that swarms on the land is detestable; it must not be eaten.
3040	3	11	42	You must not eat anything that crawls on its belly or anything that walks on all fours or on any number of legs of all the swarming things that swarm on the land, because they are detestable.
3041	3	11	43	Do not make yourselves detestable by any of the swarming things. You must not defile yourselves by them and become unclean by them,
3042	3	11	44	for I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and you are to sanctify yourselves and be holy because I am holy. You must not defile yourselves by any of the swarming things that creep on the ground,
3043	3	11	45	for I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God, and you are to be holy because I am holy.
3044	3	11	46	This is the law of the land animals, the birds, all the living creatures that move in the water, and all the creatures that swarm on the land,
3045	3	11	47	to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between the living creatures that may be eaten and the living creatures that must not be eaten.’”
3046	3	12	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3047	3	12	2	“Tell the Israelites, ‘When a woman produces offspring and bears a male child, she will be unclean seven days, as she is unclean during the days of her menstruation.
3048	3	12	3	On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin must be circumcised.
3049	3	12	4	Then she will remain thirty-three days in blood purity. She must not touch anything holy and she must not enter the sanctuary until the days of her purification are fulfilled.
3050	3	12	5	If she bears a female child, she will be impure fourteen days as during her menstrual flow, and she will remain sixty-six days in blood purity.
3051	3	12	6	¶“‘When the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter, she must bring a one-year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a sin offering to the entrance of the Meeting Tent, to the priest.
3052	3	12	7	The priest is to present it before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and make atonement on her behalf, and she will be clean from her flow of blood. This is the law of the one who bears a child, for the male or the female child.
3053	3	12	8	If she cannot afford a sheep, then she must take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and one for a sin offering, and the priest is to make atonement on her behalf, and she will be clean.’”
3054	3	13	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron:
3055	3	13	2	“When someone has a swelling or a scab or a bright spot on the skin of his body that may become a diseased infection, he must be brought to Aaron the priest or one of his sons, the priests.
3056	3	13	3	The priest must then examine the infection on the skin of the body, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of the body, then it is a diseased infection, so when the priest examines it he must pronounce the person unclean.
3057	3	13	4	¶“If it is a white bright spot on the skin of his body, but it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair has not turned white, then the priest is to quarantine the person with the infection for seven days.
3058	3	13	5	The priest must then examine it on the seventh day, and if, as far as he can see, the infection has stayed the same and has not spread on the skin, then the priest is to quarantine the person for another seven days.
3059	3	13	6	The priest must then examine it again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and has not spread on the skin, then the priest is to pronounce the person clean. It is a scab, so he must wash his clothes and be clean.
3060	3	13	7	If, however, the scab is spreading further on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his purification, then he must show himself to the priest a second time.
3061	3	13	8	The priest must then examine it, and if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest is to pronounce the person unclean. It is a disease.
3062	3	13	9	¶“When someone has a diseased infection, he must be brought to the priest.
3063	3	13	10	The priest will then examine it, and if a white swelling is on the skin, it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,
3064	3	13	11	it is a chronic disease on the skin of his body, so the priest is to pronounce him unclean. The priest must not merely quarantine him, for he is unclean.
3065	3	13	12	If, however, the disease breaks out on the skin so that the disease covers all the skin of the person with the infection from his head to his feet, as far as the priest can see,
3066	3	13	13	the priest must then examine it, and if the disease covers his whole body, he is to pronounce the person with the infection clean. He has turned all white, so he is clean.
3067	3	13	14	But whenever raw flesh appears in it he will be unclean,
3068	3	13	15	so the priest is to examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean – it is diseased.
3069	3	13	16	If, however, the raw flesh once again turns white, then he must come to the priest.
3070	3	13	17	The priest will then examine it, and if the infection has turned white, the priest is to pronounce the person with the infection clean – he is clean.
3071	3	13	18	¶“When someone’s body has a boil on its skin and it heals,
3072	3	13	19	and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish white bright spot, he must show himself to the priest.
3073	3	13	20	The priest will then examine it, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, then the priest is to pronounce the person unclean. It is a diseased infection that has broken out in the boil.
3074	3	13	21	If, however, the priest examines it, and there is no white hair in it, it is not deeper than the skin, and it has faded, then the priest is to quarantine him for seven days.
3075	3	13	22	If it is spreading further on the skin, then the priest is to pronounce him unclean. It is an infection.
3076	3	13	23	But if the bright spot stays in its place and has not spread, it is the scar of the boil, so the priest is to pronounce him clean.
3077	3	13	24	¶“When a body has a burn on its skin and the raw area of the burn becomes a reddish white or white bright spot,
3078	3	13	25	the priest must examine it, and if the hair has turned white in the bright spot and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is a disease that has broken out in the burn. The priest is to pronounce the person unclean. It is a diseased infection.
3079	3	13	26	If, however, the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the bright spot, it is not deeper than the skin, and it has faded, then the priest is to quarantine him for seven days.
3080	3	13	27	The priest must then examine it on the seventh day, and if it is spreading further on the skin, then the priest is to pronounce him unclean. It is a diseased infection.
3081	3	13	28	But if the bright spot stays in its place, has not spread on the skin, and it has faded, then it is the swelling of the burn, so the priest is to pronounce him clean, because it is the scar of the burn.
3082	3	13	29	¶“When a man or a woman has an infection on the head or in the beard,
3083	3	13	30	the priest is to examine the infection, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair in it is reddish yellow and thin, then the priest is to pronounce the person unclean. It is scall, a disease of the head or the beard.
3084	3	13	31	But if the priest examines the scall infection and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest is to quarantine the person with the scall infection for seven days.
3085	3	13	32	The priest must then examine the infection on the seventh day, and if the scall has not spread, there is no reddish yellow hair in it, and the scall does not appear to be deeper than the skin,
3086	3	13	33	then the individual is to shave himself, but he must not shave the area affected by the scall, and the priest is to quarantine the person with the scall for another seven days.
3087	3	13	34	The priest must then examine the scall on the seventh day, and if the scall has not spread on the skin and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, then the priest is to pronounce him clean. So he is to wash his clothes and be clean.
3088	3	13	35	If, however, the scall spreads further on the skin after his purification,
3089	3	13	36	then the priest is to examine it, and if the scall has spread on the skin the priest is not to search further for reddish yellow hair. The person is unclean.
3090	3	13	37	If, as far as the priest can see, the scall has stayed the same and black hair has sprouted in it, the scall has been healed; the person is clean. So the priest is to pronounce him clean.
3091	3	13	38	¶“When a man or a woman has bright spots – white bright spots – on the skin of their body,
3092	3	13	39	the priest is to examine them, and if the bright spots on the skin of their body are faded white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin. The person is clean.
3093	3	13	40	¶“When a man’s head is bare so that he is balding in back, he is clean.
3094	3	13	41	If his head is bare on the forehead so that he is balding in front, he is clean.
3095	3	13	42	But if there is a reddish white infection in the back or front bald area, it is a disease breaking out in his back or front bald area.
3096	3	13	43	The priest is to examine it, and if the swelling of the infection is reddish white in the back or front bald area like the appearance of a disease on the skin of the body,
3097	3	13	44	he is a diseased man. He is unclean. The priest must surely pronounce him unclean because of his infection on his head.
3098	3	13	45	¶“As for the diseased person who has the infection, his clothes must be torn, the hair of his head must be unbound, he must cover his mustache, and he must call out ‘Unclean! Unclean!’
3099	3	13	46	The whole time he has the infection he will be continually unclean. He must live in isolation, and his place of residence must be outside the camp.
3100	3	13	47	¶“When a garment has a diseased infection in it, whether a wool or linen garment,
3101	3	13	48	or in the warp or woof of the linen or the wool, or in leather or anything made of leather,
3102	3	13	49	if the infection in the garment or leather or warp or woof or any article of leather is yellowish green or reddish, it is a diseased infection and it must be shown to the priest.
3103	3	13	50	The priest is to examine and then quarantine the article with the infection for seven days.
3104	3	13	51	He must then examine the infection on the seventh day. If the infection has spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the leather – whatever the article into which the leather was made – the infection is a malignant disease. It is unclean.
3105	3	13	52	He must burn the garment or the warp or the woof, whether wool or linen, or any article of leather which has the infection in it. Because it is a malignant disease it must be burned up in the fire.
3106	3	13	53	But if the priest examines it and the infection has not spread in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of leather,
3107	3	13	54	the priest is to command that they wash whatever has the infection and quarantine it for another seven days.
3108	3	13	55	The priest must then examine it after the infection has been washed out, and if the infection has not changed its appearance even though the infection has not spread, it is unclean. You must burn it up in the fire. It is a fungus, whether on the back side or front side of the article.
3109	3	13	56	But if the priest has examined it and the infection has faded after it has been washed, he is to tear it out of the garment or the leather or the warp or the woof.
3110	3	13	57	Then if it still appears again in the garment or the warp or the woof, or in any article of leather, it is an outbreak. Whatever has the infection in it you must burn up in the fire.
3111	3	13	58	But the garment or the warp or the woof or any article of leather which you wash and infection disappears from it is to be washed a second time and it will be clean.”
3112	3	13	59	¶This is the law of the diseased infection in the garment of wool or linen, or the warp or woof, or any article of leather, for pronouncing it clean or unclean.
3113	3	14	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3114	3	14	2	“This is the law of the diseased person on the day of his purification, when he is brought to the priest.
3115	3	14	3	The priest is to go outside the camp and examine the infection. If the infection of the diseased person has been healed,
3116	3	14	4	then the priest will command that two live clean birds, a piece of cedar wood, a scrap of crimson fabric, and some twigs of hyssop be taken up for the one being cleansed.
3117	3	14	5	The priest will then command that one bird be slaughtered into a clay vessel over fresh water.
3118	3	14	6	Then he is to take the live bird along with the piece of cedar wood, the scrap of crimson fabric, and the twigs of hyssop, and he is to dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird slaughtered over the fresh water,
3119	3	14	7	and sprinkle it seven times on the one being cleansed from the disease, pronounce him clean, and send the live bird away over the open countryside.
3120	3	14	8	¶“The one being cleansed must then wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, and bathe in water, and so be clean. Then afterward he may enter the camp, but he must live outside his tent seven days.
3121	3	14	9	When the seventh day comes he must shave all his hair – his head, his beard, his eyebrows, all his hair – and he must wash his clothes, bathe his body in water, and so be clean.
3122	3	14	10	¶“On the eighth day he must take two flawless male lambs, one flawless yearling female lamb, three-tenths of an ephah of choice wheat flour as a grain offering mixed with olive oil, and one log of olive oil,
3123	3	14	11	and the priest who pronounces him clean will have the man who is being cleansed stand along with these offerings before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.
3124	3	14	12	¶“The priest is to take one male lamb and present it for a guilt offering along with the log of olive oil and present them as a wave offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3125	3	14	13	He must then slaughter the male lamb in the place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are slaughtered, in the sanctuary, because, like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
3126	3	14	14	Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one being cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
3127	3	14	15	The priest will then take some of the log of olive oil and pour it into his own left hand.
3128	3	14	16	Then the priest is to dip his right forefinger into the olive oil that is in his left hand, and sprinkle some of the olive oil with his finger seven times before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3129	3	14	17	The priest will then put some of the rest of the olive oil that is in his hand on the right earlobe of the one being cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt offering,
3130	3	14	18	and the remainder of the olive oil that is in his hand the priest is to put on the head of the one being cleansed. So the priest is to make atonement for him before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3131	3	14	19	¶“The priest must then perform the sin offering and make atonement for the one being cleansed from his impurity. After that he is to slaughter the burnt offering,
3132	3	14	20	and the priest is to offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. So the priest is to make atonement for him and he will be clean.
3133	3	14	21	¶“If the person is poor and does not have sufficient means, he must take one male lamb as a guilt offering for a wave offering to make atonement for himself, one-tenth of an ephah of choice wheat flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, a log of olive oil,
3134	3	14	22	and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, which are within his means. One will be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
3135	3	14	23	¶“On the eighth day he must bring them for his purification to the priest at the entrance of the Meeting Tent before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
3136	3	14	24	and the priest is to take the male lamb of the guilt offering and the log of olive oil and wave them as a wave offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3137	3	14	25	Then he is to slaughter the male lamb of the guilt offering, and the priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one being cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
3138	3	14	26	The priest will then pour some of the olive oil into his own left hand,
3139	3	14	27	and sprinkle some of the olive oil that is in his left hand with his right forefinger seven times before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3140	3	14	28	Then the priest is to put some of the olive oil that is in his hand on the right earlobe of the one being cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt offering,
3141	3	14	29	and the remainder of the olive oil that is in the hand of the priest he is to put on the head of the one being cleansed to make atonement for him before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3142	3	14	30	¶“He will then make one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, which are within his means,
3143	3	14	31	a sin offering and the other a burnt offering along with the grain offering. So the priest is to make atonement for the one being cleansed before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3144	3	14	32	This is the law of the one in whom there is a diseased infection, who does not have sufficient means for his purification.”
3145	3	14	33	¶The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron:
3146	3	14	34	“When you enter the land of Canaan which I am about to give to you for a possession, and I put a diseased infection in a house in the land you are to possess,
3147	3	14	35	then whoever owns the house must come and declare to the priest, ‘Something like an infection is visible to me in the house.’
3148	3	14	36	Then the priest will command that the house be cleared before the priest enters to examine the infection so that everything in the house does not become unclean, and afterward the priest will enter to examine the house.
3149	3	14	37	He is to examine the infection, and if the infection in the walls of the house consists of yellowish green or reddish eruptions, and it appears to be deeper than the surface of the wall,
3150	3	14	38	then the priest is to go out of the house to the doorway of the house and quarantine the house for seven days.
3151	3	14	39	The priest must return on the seventh day and examine it, and if the infection has spread in the walls of the house,
3152	3	14	40	then the priest is to command that the stones that had the infection in them be pulled and thrown outside the city into an unclean place.
3153	3	14	41	Then they shall scrape the house all around on the inside, and the plaster which they have scraped off must be dumped outside the city into an unclean place.
3154	3	14	42	They are then to take other stones and replace those stones, and he is to take other plaster and replaster the house.
3155	3	14	43	¶“If the infection returns and breaks out in the house after he has pulled out the stones, scraped the house, and it is replastered,
3156	3	14	44	the priest is to come and examine it, and if the infection has spread in the house, it is a malignant disease in the house. It is unclean.
3157	3	14	45	He must tear down the house, its stones, its wood, and all the plaster of the house, and bring all of it outside the city to an unclean place.
3158	3	14	46	Anyone who enters the house all the days the priest has quarantined it will be unclean until evening.
3159	3	14	47	Anyone who lies down in the house must wash his clothes. Anyone who eats in the house must wash his clothes.
3160	3	14	48	¶“If, however, the priest enters and examines it, and the infection has not spread in the house after the house has been replastered, then the priest is to pronounce the house clean because the infection has been healed.
3161	3	14	49	Then he is to take two birds, a piece of cedar wood, a scrap of crimson fabric, and some twigs of hyssop to purify the house,
3162	3	14	50	and he is to slaughter one bird into a clay vessel over fresh water.
3163	3	14	51	He must then take the piece of cedar wood, the twigs of hyssop, the scrap of crimson fabric, and the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and in the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
3164	3	14	52	So he is to purify the house with the blood of the bird, the fresh water, the live bird, the piece of cedar wood, the twigs of hyssop, and the scrap of crimson fabric,
3165	3	14	53	and he is to send the live bird away outside the city into the open countryside. So he is to make atonement for the house and it will be clean.
3166	3	14	54	¶“This is the law for all diseased infections, for scall,
3167	3	14	55	for the diseased garment, for the house,
3168	3	14	56	for the swelling, for the scab, and for the bright spot,
3169	3	14	57	to teach when something is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law for dealing with infectious disease.”
3170	3	15	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron:
3171	3	15	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean.
3172	3	15	3	Now this is his uncleanness in regard to his discharge – whether his body secretes his discharge or blocks his discharge, he is unclean. All the days that his body has a discharge or his body blocks his discharge, this is his uncleanness.
3173	3	15	4	¶“‘Any bed the man with a discharge lies on will be unclean, and any furniture he sits on will be unclean.
3174	3	15	5	Anyone who touches his bed must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
3175	3	15	6	The one who sits on the furniture the man with a discharge sits on must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
3176	3	15	7	The one who touches the body of the man with a discharge must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
3177	3	15	8	If the man with a discharge spits on a person who is ceremonially clean, that person must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
3178	3	15	9	Any means of riding the man with a discharge rides on will be unclean.
3179	3	15	10	Anyone who touches anything that was under him will be unclean until evening, and the one who carries those items must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
3180	3	15	11	Anyone whom the man with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
3181	3	15	12	A clay vessel which the man with the discharge touches must be broken, and any wooden utensil must be rinsed in water.
3182	3	15	13	¶“‘When the man with the discharge becomes clean from his discharge he is to count off for himself seven days for his purification, and he must wash his clothes, bathe in fresh water, and be clean.
3183	3	15	14	Then on the eighth day he is to take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and he is to present himself before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at the entrance of the Meeting Tent and give them to the priest,
3184	3	15	15	and the priest is to make one of them a sin offering and the other a burnt offering. So the priest is to make atonement for him before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for his discharge.
3185	3	15	16	¶“‘When a man has a seminal emission, he must bathe his whole body in water and be unclean until evening,
3186	3	15	17	and he must wash in water any clothing or leather that has semen on it, and it will be unclean until evening.
3187	3	15	18	As for a woman whom a man goes to bed with, then has a seminal emission, they must bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
3188	3	15	19	¶“‘When a woman has a discharge and her discharge is blood from her body, she is to be in her menstruation seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening.
3189	3	15	20	Anything she lies on during her menstruation will be unclean, and anything she sits on will be unclean.
3190	3	15	21	Anyone who touches her bed must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
3191	3	15	22	Anyone who touches any furniture she sits on must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
3192	3	15	23	If there is something on the bed or on the furniture she sits on, when he touches it he will be unclean until evening,
3193	3	15	24	and if a man actually goes to bed with her so that her menstrual impurity touches him, then he will be unclean seven days and any bed he lies on will be unclean.
3194	3	15	25	¶“‘When a woman’s discharge of blood flows many days not at the time of her menstruation, or if it flows beyond the time of her menstruation, all the days of her discharge of impurity will be like the days of her menstruation – she is unclean.
3195	3	15	26	Any bed she lies on all the days of her discharge will be to her like the bed of her menstruation, any furniture she sits on will be unclean like the impurity of her menstruation,
3196	3	15	27	and anyone who touches them will be unclean, and he must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
3197	3	15	28	¶“‘If she becomes clean from her discharge, then she is to count off for herself seven days, and afterward she will be clean.

3201	3	15	32	This is the law for the one with a discharge: for the one who has a seminal emission and becomes unclean by it,
3202	3	15	33	for the one who is sick in her menstruation, for the one with a discharge, whether male or female, and for a man who goes to bed with an unclean woman.’”
3203	3	16	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses after the death of Aaron’s two sons when they approached the presence of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and died,
3204	3	16	2	and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses: “Tell Aaron your brother that he must not enter at any time into the holy place inside the special curtain in front of the atonement lid that is on the ark so that he may not die, for I will appear in the cloud over the atonement lid.
3205	3	16	3	¶“In this way Aaron is to enter into the sanctuary – with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
3206	3	16	4	He must put on a holy linen tunic, linen leggings are to cover his body, and he is to wrap himself with a linen sash and wrap his head with a linen turban. They are holy garments, so he must bathe his body in water and put them on.
3207	3	16	5	He must also take two male goats from the congregation of the Israelites for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
3208	3	16	6	Then Aaron is to present the sin offering bull which is for himself and is to make atonement on behalf of himself and his household.
3209	3	16	7	He must then take the two goats and stand them before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at the entrance of the Meeting Tent,
3210	3	16	8	and Aaron is to cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and one lot for Azazel.
3211	3	16	9	Aaron must then present the goat which has been designated by lot for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and he is to make it a sin offering,
3212	3	16	10	but the goat which has been designated by lot for Azazel is to be stood alive before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to make atonement on it by sending it away to Azazel into the desert.
3213	3	16	11	¶“Aaron is to present the sin offering bull which is for himself, and he is to make atonement on behalf of himself and his household. He is to slaughter the sin offering bull which is for himself,
3214	3	16	12	and take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and a full double handful of finely ground fragrant incense, and bring them inside the curtain.
3215	3	16	13	He must then put the incense on the fire before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the cloud of incense will cover the atonement lid which is above the ark of the testimony, so that he will not die.
3216	3	16	14	Then he is to take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the eastern face of the atonement lid, and in front of the atonement lid he is to sprinkle some of the blood seven times with his finger.
3217	3	16	15	¶“He must then slaughter the sin offering goat which is for the people. He is to bring its blood inside the curtain, and he is to do with its blood just as he did to the blood of the bull: He is to sprinkle it on the atonement lid and in front of the atonement lid.
3218	3	16	16	So he is to make atonement for the holy place from the impurities of the Israelites and from their transgressions with regard to all their sins, and thus he is to do for the Meeting Tent which resides with them in the midst of their impurities.
3219	3	16	17	Nobody is to be in the Meeting Tent when he enters to make atonement in the holy place until he goes out, and he has made atonement on his behalf, on behalf of his household, and on behalf of the whole assembly of Israel.
3220	3	16	18	¶“Then he is to go out to the altar which is before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and make atonement for it. He is to take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it all around on the horns of the altar.
3221	3	16	19	Then he is to sprinkle on it some of the blood with his finger seven times, and cleanse and consecrate it from the impurities of the Israelites.
3222	3	16	20	¶“When he has finished purifying the holy place, the Meeting Tent, and the altar, he is to present the live goat.
3223	3	16	21	Aaron is to lay his two hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the Israelites and all their transgressions in regard to all their sins, and thus he is to put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the desert by the hand of a man standing ready.
3224	3	16	22	The goat is to bear on itself all their iniquities into an inaccessible land, so he is to send the goat away in the desert.
3225	3	16	23	¶“Aaron must then enter the Meeting Tent and take off the linen garments which he had put on when he entered the sanctuary, and leave them there.
3226	3	16	24	Then he must bathe his body in water in a holy place, put on his clothes, and go out and make his burnt offering and the people’s burnt offering. So he is to make atonement on behalf of himself and the people.
3227	3	16	25	¶“Then he is to offer up the fat of the sin offering in smoke on the altar,
3228	3	16	26	and the one who sent the goat away to Azazel must wash his clothes, bathe his body in water, and afterward he may reenter the camp.
3229	3	16	27	The bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought to make atonement in the holy place, must be brought outside the camp and their hide, their flesh, and their dung must be burned up,
3230	3	16	28	and the one who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may reenter the camp.
3231	3	16	29	¶“This is to be a perpetual statute for you. In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you must humble yourselves and do no work of any kind, both the native citizen and the resident foreigner who lives in your midst,
3232	3	16	30	for on this day atonement is to be made for you to cleanse you from all your sins; you must be clean before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3233	3	16	31	It is to be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you must humble yourselves. It is a perpetual statute.
3234	3	16	32	¶“The priest who is anointed and ordained to act as high priest in place of his father is to make atonement. He is to put on the linen garments, the holy garments,
3235	3	16	33	and he is to purify the Most Holy Place, he is to purify the Meeting Tent and the altar, and he is to make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
3236	3	16	34	This is to be a perpetual statute for you to make atonement for the Israelites for all their sins once a year.” So he did just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
3237	3	17	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3238	3	17	2	“Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites, and tell them: ‘This is the word that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded:
3239	3	17	3	“Blood guilt will be accounted to any man from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox or a lamb or a goat inside the camp or outside the camp,
3240	3	17	4	but has not brought it to the entrance of the Meeting Tent to present it as an offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> before the tabernacle of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He has shed blood, so that man will be cut off from the midst of his people.
3241	3	17	5	This is so that the Israelites will bring their sacrifices that they are sacrificing in the open field to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at the entrance of the Meeting Tent to the priest and sacrifice them there as peace offering sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3242	3	17	6	The priest is to splash the blood on the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at the entrance of the Meeting Tent, and offer the fat up in smoke for a soothing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3243	3	17	7	So they must no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat demons, acting like prostitutes by going after them. This is to be a perpetual statute for them throughout their generations.
3244	3	17	8	¶“You are to say to them: ‘Any man from the house of Israel or from the resident foreigners who live in their midst, who offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice
3245	3	17	9	but does not bring it to the entrance of the Meeting Tent to offer it to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – that person will be cut off from his people.
3246	3	17	10	¶“‘Any man from the house of Israel or from the resident foreigners who live in their midst who eats any blood, I will set my face against that person who eats the blood, and I will cut him off from the midst of his people,
3247	3	17	11	for the life of every living thing is in the blood. So I myself have assigned it to you on the altar to make atonement for your lives, for the blood makes atonement by means of the life.
3248	3	17	12	Therefore, I have said to the Israelites: No person among you is to eat blood, and no resident foreigner who lives among you is to eat blood.
3249	3	17	13	¶“‘Any man from the Israelites or from the resident foreigners who live in their midst who hunts a wild animal or a bird that may be eaten must pour out its blood and cover it with soil,
3250	3	17	14	for the life of all flesh is its blood. So I have said to the Israelites: You must not eat the blood of any living thing because the life of every living thing is its blood – all who eat it will be cut off.
3251	3	17	15	¶“‘Any person who eats an animal that has died of natural causes or an animal torn by beasts, whether a native citizen or a resident foreigner, must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening; then he becomes clean.
3252	3	17	16	But if he does not wash his clothes and does not bathe his body, he will bear his punishment for iniquity.’”
3253	3	18	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3254	3	18	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God!
3255	3	18	3	You must not do as they do in the land of Egypt where you have been living, and you must not do as they do in the land of Canaan into which I am about to bring you; you must not walk in their statutes.
3256	3	18	4	You must observe my regulations and you must be sure to walk in my statutes. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
3257	3	18	5	So you must keep my statutes and my regulations; anyone who does so will live by keeping them. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3258	3	18	6	¶“‘No man is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations with her. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3259	3	18	7	You must not expose your father’s nakedness by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; you must not have sexual relations with her.
3260	3	18	8	You must not have sexual relations with your father’s wife; she is your father’s nakedness.
3261	3	18	9	You must not have sexual relations with your sister, whether she is your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she is born in the same household or born outside it; you must not have sexual relations with either of them.
3262	3	18	10	You must not expose the nakedness of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter by having sexual relations with them, because they are your own nakedness.
3263	3	18	11	You must not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife born of your father; she is your sister. You must not have sexual relations with her.
3264	3	18	12	You must not have sexual relations with your father’s sister; she is your father’s flesh.
3265	3	18	13	You must not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister, because she is your mother’s flesh.
3266	3	18	14	You must not expose the nakedness of your father’s brother; you must not approach his wife to have marital relations with her. She is your aunt.
3267	3	18	15	You must not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife. You must not have sexual relations with her.
3268	3	18	16	You must not have sexual relations with your brother’s wife; she is your brother’s nakedness.
3269	3	18	17	You must not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter; you must not take as wife either her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter to have sexual relations with them. They are closely related to her – it is lewdness.
3270	3	18	18	You must not take a woman in marriage and then marry her sister as a rival wife while she is still alive, to have sexual relations with her.
3271	3	18	19	¶“‘You must not approach a woman in her menstrual impurity to have sexual relations with her.
3272	3	18	20	You must not have sexual relations with the wife of your fellow citizen to become unclean with her.
3273	3	18	21	You must not give any of your children as an offering to Molech, so that you do not profane the name of your God. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!
3274	3	18	22	You must not have sexual relations with a male as one has sexual relations with a woman; it is a detestable act.
3275	3	18	23	You must not have sexual relations with any animal to become defiled with it, and a woman must not stand before an animal to have sexual relations with it; it is a perversion.
3276	3	18	24	¶“‘Do not defile yourselves with any of these things, for the nations which I am about to drive out before you have been defiled with all these things.
3277	3	18	25	Therefore the land has become unclean and I have brought the punishment for its iniquity upon it, so that the land has vomited out its inhabitants.
3278	3	18	26	You yourselves must obey my statutes and my regulations and must not do any of these abominations, both the native citizen and the resident foreigner in your midst,
3279	3	18	27	for the people who were in the land before you have done all these abominations, and the land has become unclean.
3280	3	18	28	So do not make the land vomit you out because you defile it just as it has vomited out the nations that were before you.
3281	3	18	29	For if anyone does any of these abominations, the persons who do them will be cut off from the midst of their people.
3282	3	18	30	You must obey my charge not to practice any of the abominable statutes that have been done before you, so that you do not defile yourselves by them. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.’”
3283	3	19	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3284	3	19	2	“Speak to the whole congregation of the Israelites and tell them, ‘You must be holy because I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, am holy.
3285	3	19	3	Each of you must respect his mother and his father, and you must keep my Sabbaths. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
3286	3	19	4	Do not turn to idols, and you must not make for yourselves gods of cast metal. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
3287	3	19	5	¶“‘When you sacrifice a peace offering sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you must sacrifice it so that it is accepted for you.
3288	3	19	6	It must be eaten on the day of your sacrifice and on the following day, but what is left over until the third day must be burned up.
3289	3	19	7	If, however, it is eaten on the third day, it is spoiled, it will not be accepted,
3290	3	19	8	and the one who eats it will bear his punishment for iniquity because he has profaned what is holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. That person will be cut off from his people.
3291	3	19	9	¶“‘When you gather in the harvest of your land, you must not completely harvest the corner of your field, and you must not gather up the gleanings of your harvest.
3292	3	19	10	You must not pick your vineyard bare, and you must not gather up the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You must leave them for the poor and the resident foreigner. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
3293	3	19	11	¶“‘You must not steal, you must not tell lies, and you must not deal falsely with your fellow citizen.
3294	3	19	12	You must not swear falsely in my name, so that you do not profane the name of your God. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3295	3	19	13	You must not oppress your neighbor or commit robbery against him. You must not withhold the wages of the hired laborer overnight until morning.
3296	3	19	14	You must not curse a deaf person or put a stumbling block in front of a blind person. You must fear your God; I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3297	3	19	15	¶“‘You must not deal unjustly in judgment: you must neither show partiality to the poor nor honor the rich. You must judge your fellow citizen fairly.
3298	3	19	16	You must not go about as a slanderer among your people. You must not stand idly by when your neighbor’s life is at stake. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3299	3	19	17	You must not hate your brother in your heart. You must surely reprove your fellow citizen so that you do not incur sin on account of him.
3300	3	19	18	You must not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the children of your people, but you must love your neighbor as yourself. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3301	3	19	19	You must keep my statutes. You must not allow two different kinds of your animals to breed, you must not sow your field with two different kinds of seed, and you must not wear a garment made of two different kinds of fabric.
3302	3	19	20	¶“‘When a man goes to bed with a woman for intercourse, although she is a slave woman designated for another man and she has not yet been ransomed, or freedom has not been granted to her, there will be an obligation to pay compensation. They must not be put to death, because she was not free.
3303	3	19	21	He must bring his guilt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at the entrance of the Meeting Tent, a guilt offering ram,
3304	3	19	22	and the priest is to make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for his sin that he has committed, and he will be forgiven of his sin that he has committed.
3305	3	19	23	¶“‘When you enter the land and plant any fruit tree, you must consider its fruit to be forbidden. Three years it will be forbidden to you; it must not be eaten.
3306	3	19	24	In the fourth year all its fruit will be holy, praise offerings to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3307	3	19	25	Then in the fifth year you may eat its fruit to add its produce to your harvest. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.

3309	3	19	27	You must not round off the corners of the hair on your head or ruin the corners of your beard.
3310	3	19	28	You must not slash your body for a dead person or incise a tattoo on yourself. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3311	3	19	29	Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, so that the land does not practice prostitution and become full of lewdness.
3312	3	19	30	¶“‘You must keep my Sabbaths and fear my sanctuary. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.

3316	3	19	34	The resident foreigner who lives with you must be to you like a native citizen among you; so you must love him as yourself, because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
3317	3	19	35	You must not do injustice in the regulation of measures, whether of length, weight, or volume.
3318	3	19	36	You must have honest balances, honest weights, an honest ephah, and an honest hin. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt.
3319	3	19	37	You must be sure to obey all my statutes and regulations. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.

3321	3	20	2	“You are to say to the Israelites, ‘Any man from the Israelites or from the resident foreigners who live in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech must be put to death; the people of the land must pelt him with stones.
3322	3	20	3	I myself will set my face against that man and cut him off from the midst of his people, because he has given some of his children to Molech and thereby defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name.
3323	3	20	4	If, however, the people of the land shut their eyes to that man when he gives some of his children to Molech so that they do not put him to death,
3324	3	20	5	I myself will set my face against that man and his clan. I will cut off from the midst of their people both him and all who follow after him in spiritual prostitution, to commit prostitution by worshiping Molech.
3325	3	20	6	¶“‘The person who turns to the spirits of the dead and familiar spirits to commit prostitution by going after them, I will set my face against that person and cut him off from the midst of his people.
3326	3	20	7	¶“‘You must sanctify yourselves and be holy, because I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
3327	3	20	8	You must be sure to obey my statutes. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who sanctifies you.
3328	3	20	9	¶“‘If anyone curses his father and mother he must be put to death. He has cursed his father and mother; his blood guilt is on himself.
3329	3	20	10	If a man commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.
3330	3	20	11	If a man goes to bed with his father’s wife, he has exposed his father’s nakedness. Both of them must be put to death; their blood guilt is on themselves.
3331	3	20	12	If a man goes to bed with his daughter-in-law, both of them must be put to death. They have committed perversion; their blood guilt is on themselves.
3332	3	20	13	If a man goes to bed with a male as one goes to bed with a woman, the two of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood guilt is on themselves.
3333	3	20	14	If a man has marital relations with both a woman and her mother, it is lewdness. Both he and they must be burned to death, so there is no lewdness in your midst.
3334	3	20	15	If a man has sexual relations with any animal, he must be put to death, and you must kill the animal.
3335	3	20	16	If a woman approaches any animal to copulate with it, you must kill the woman, and the animal must be put to death; their blood guilt is on themselves.
3336	3	20	17	¶“‘If a man has marital relations with his sister, whether the daughter of his father or his mother, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace. They must be cut off in the sight of the children of their people. He has exposed his sister’s nakedness; he will bear his punishment for iniquity.
3337	3	20	18	If a man goes to bed with a menstruating woman and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her fountain of blood and she has exposed the fountain of her blood, so both of them must be cut off from the midst of their people.
3338	3	20	19	You must not expose the nakedness of your mother’s sister and your father’s sister, for such a person has laid bare his own close relative. They must bear their punishment for iniquity.
3339	3	20	20	If a man goes to bed with his aunt, he has exposed his uncle’s nakedness; they must bear responsibility for their sin, they will die childless.
3340	3	20	21	If a man has marital relations with his brother’s wife, it is indecency. He has exposed his brother’s nakedness; they will be childless.

3347	3	21	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses: “Say to the priests, the sons of Aaron – say to them, ‘For a dead person no priest is to defile himself among his people,
3348	3	21	2	except for his close relative who is near to him: his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, his brother,
3349	3	21	3	and his virgin sister who is near to him, who has no husband; he may defile himself for her.
3350	3	21	4	He must not defile himself as a husband among his people so as to profane himself.
3351	3	21	5	Priests must not have a bald spot shaved on their head, they must not shave the corner of their beard, and they must not cut slashes in their body.
3352	3	21	6	¶“‘They must be holy to their God, and they must not profane the name of their God, because they are the ones who present the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s gifts, the food of their God. Therefore they must be holy.
3353	3	21	7	They must not take a wife defiled by prostitution, nor are they to take a wife divorced from her husband, for the priest is holy to his God.
3354	3	21	8	You must sanctify him because he presents the food of your God. He must be holy to you because I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who sanctifies you all, am holy.
3355	3	21	9	If a daughter of a priest profanes herself by engaging in prostitution, she is profaning her father. She must be burned to death.
3356	3	21	10	¶“‘The high priest – who is greater than his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil is poured, who has been ordained to wear the priestly garments – must neither dishevel the hair of his head nor tear his garments.
3357	3	21	11	He must not go where there is any dead person; he must not defile himself even for his father and his mother.
3358	3	21	12	He must not go out from the sanctuary and must not profane the sanctuary of his God, because the dedication of the anointing oil of his God is on him. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3359	3	21	13	He must take a wife who is a virgin.
3360	3	21	14	He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or one profaned by prostitution; he may only take a virgin from his people as a wife.
3361	3	21	15	He must not profane his children among his people, for I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who sanctifies him.’”
3362	3	21	16	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3363	3	21	17	“Tell Aaron, ‘No man from your descendants throughout their generations who has a physical flaw is to approach to present the food of his God.
3364	3	21	18	Certainly no man who has a physical flaw is to approach: a blind man, or one who is lame, or one with a slit nose, or a limb too long,
3365	3	21	19	or a man who has had a broken leg or arm,
3366	3	21	20	or a hunchback, or a dwarf, or one with a spot in his eye, or a festering eruption, or a feverish rash, or a crushed testicle.
3367	3	21	21	No man from the descendants of Aaron the priest who has a physical flaw may step forward to present the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s gifts; he has a physical flaw, so he must not step forward to present the food of his God.
3368	3	21	22	He may eat both the most holy and the holy food of his God,
3369	3	21	23	but he must not go near the special curtain or step forward to the altar because he has a physical flaw. Thus he must not profane my holy places, for I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who sanctifies them.’”
3370	3	21	24	¶So Moses spoke these things to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites.
3371	3	22	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3372	3	22	2	“Tell Aaron and his sons that they must deal respectfully with the holy offerings of the Israelites, which they consecrate to me, so that they do not profane my holy name. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3373	3	22	3	Say to them, ‘Throughout your generations, if any man from all your descendants approaches the holy offerings which the Israelites consecrate to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> while he is impure, that person must be cut off from before me. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3374	3	22	4	No man from the descendants of Aaron who is diseased or has a discharge may eat the holy offerings until he becomes clean. The one who touches anything made unclean by contact with a dead person, or a man who has a seminal emission,
3375	3	22	5	or a man who touches a swarming thing by which he becomes unclean, or touches a person by which he becomes unclean, whatever that person’s impurity –
3376	3	22	6	the person who touches any of these will be unclean until evening and must not eat from the holy offerings unless he has bathed his body in water.
3377	3	22	7	When the sun goes down he will be clean, and afterward he may eat from the holy offerings, because they are his food.
3378	3	22	8	He must not eat an animal that has died of natural causes or an animal torn by beasts and thus become unclean by it. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3379	3	22	9	They must keep my charge so that they do not incur sin on account of it and therefore die because they profane it. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who sanctifies them.
3380	3	22	10	¶“‘No lay person may eat anything holy. Neither a priest’s lodger nor a hired laborer may eat anything holy,
3381	3	22	11	but if a priest buys a person with his own money, that person may eat the holy offerings, and those born in the priest’s own house may eat his food.
3382	3	22	12	If a priest’s daughter marries a lay person, she may not eat the holy contribution offerings,
3383	3	22	13	but if a priest’s daughter is a widow or divorced, and she has no children so that she returns to live in her father’s house as in her youth, she may eat from her father’s food, but no lay person may eat it.
3384	3	22	14	¶“‘If a man eats a holy offering by mistake, he must add one fifth to it and give the holy offering to the priest.
3385	3	22	15	They must not profane the holy offerings which the Israelites contribute to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
3386	3	22	16	and so cause them to incur a penalty for guilt when they eat their holy offerings, for I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who sanctifies them.’”
3387	3	22	17	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3388	3	22	18	“Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites and tell them, ‘When any man from the house of Israel or from the resident foreigners in Israel presents his offering for any of the votive or freewill offerings which they present to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as a burnt offering,
3389	3	22	19	if it is to be acceptable for your benefit it must be a flawless male from the cattle, sheep, or goats.
3390	3	22	20	You must not present anything that has a flaw, because it will not be acceptable for your benefit.
3391	3	22	21	If a man presents a peace offering sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for a special votive offering or for a freewill offering from the herd or the flock, it must be flawless to be acceptable; it must have no flaw.
3392	3	22	22	¶“‘You must not present to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> something blind, or with a broken bone, or mutilated, or with a running sore, or with a festering eruption, or with a feverish rash. You must not give any of these as a gift on the altar to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3393	3	22	23	As for an ox or a sheep with a limb too long or stunted, you may present it as a freewill offering, but it will not be acceptable for a votive offering.
3394	3	22	24	You must not present to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> something with testicles that are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut off; you must not do this in your land.
3395	3	22	25	Even from a foreigner you must not present the food of your God from such animals as these, for they are ruined and flawed; they will not be acceptable for your benefit.’”
3396	3	22	26	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3397	3	22	27	“When an ox, lamb, or goat is born, it must be under the care of its mother seven days, but from the eighth day onward it will be acceptable as an offering gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3398	3	22	28	You must not slaughter an ox or a sheep and its young on the same day.
3399	3	22	29	When you sacrifice a thanksgiving offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you must sacrifice it so that it is acceptable for your benefit.
3400	3	22	30	On that very day it must be eaten; you must not leave any part of it over until morning. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3401	3	22	31	¶“You must be sure to do my commandments. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3402	3	22	32	You must not profane my holy name, and I will be sanctified in the midst of the Israelites. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who sanctifies you,
3403	3	22	33	the one who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3404	3	23	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3405	3	23	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘These are the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s appointed times which you must proclaim as holy assemblies – my appointed times:
3406	3	23	3	¶“‘Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there must be a Sabbath of complete rest, a holy assembly. You must not do any work; it is a Sabbath to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in all the places where you live.
3407	3	23	4	¶“‘These are the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s appointed times, holy assemblies, which you must proclaim at their appointed time.
3408	3	23	5	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, is a Passover offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3409	3	23	6	Then on the fifteenth day of the same month will be the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; seven days you must eat unleavened bread.
3410	3	23	7	On the first day there will be a holy assembly for you; you must not do any regular work.
3411	3	23	8	You must present a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for seven days, and the seventh day is a holy assembly; you must not do any regular work.’”
3412	3	23	9	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3413	3	23	10	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you enter the land that I am about to give to you and you gather in its harvest, then you must bring the sheaf of the first portion of your harvest to the priest,
3414	3	23	11	and he must wave the sheaf before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to be accepted for your benefit – on the day after the Sabbath the priest is to wave it.
3415	3	23	12	On the day you wave the sheaf you must also offer a flawless yearling lamb for a burnt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
3416	3	23	13	along with its grain offering, two tenths of an ephah of choice wheat flour mixed with olive oil, as a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, a soothing aroma, and its drink offering, one fourth of a hin of wine.
3417	3	23	14	You must not eat bread, roasted grain, or fresh grain until this very day, until you bring the offering of your God. This is a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all the places where you live.
3418	3	23	15	¶“‘You must count for yourselves seven weeks from the day after the Sabbath, from the day you bring the wave offering sheaf; they must be complete weeks.
3419	3	23	16	You must count fifty days – until the day after the seventh Sabbath – and then you must present a new grain offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3420	3	23	17	From the places where you live you must bring two loaves of bread for a wave offering; they must be made from two tenths of an ephah of fine wheat flour, baked with yeast, as first fruits to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3421	3	23	18	Along with the loaves of bread, you must also present seven flawless yearling lambs, one young bull, and two rams. They are to be a burnt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> along with their grain offering and drink offerings, a gift of a soothing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3422	3	23	19	You must also offer one male goat for a sin offering and two yearling lambs for a peace offering sacrifice,
3423	3	23	20	and the priest is to wave them – the two lambs – along with the bread of the first fruits, as a wave offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; they will be holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for the priest.
3424	3	23	21	¶“‘On this very day you must proclaim an assembly; it is to be a holy assembly for you. You must not do any regular work. This is a perpetual statute in all the places where you live throughout your generations.
3425	3	23	22	When you gather in the harvest of your land, you must not completely harvest the corner of your field, and you must not gather up the gleanings of your harvest. You must leave them for the poor and the resident foreigner. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.’”
3426	3	23	23	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3427	3	23	24	“Tell the Israelites, ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you must have a complete rest, a memorial announced by loud horn blasts, a holy assembly.
3428	3	23	25	You must not do any regular work, but you must present a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3429	3	23	26	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3430	3	23	27	“The tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It is to be a holy assembly for you, and you must humble yourselves and present a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3431	3	23	28	You must not do any work on this particular day, because it is a day of atonement to make atonement for yourselves before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
3432	3	23	29	Indeed, any person who does not behave with humility on this particular day will be cut off from his people.
3433	3	23	30	As for any person who does any work on this particular day, I will exterminate that person from the midst of his people!
3434	3	23	31	You must not do any work. This is a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all the places where you live.
3435	3	23	32	It is a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you must humble yourselves on the ninth day of the month in the evening, from evening until evening you must observe your Sabbath.”
3436	3	23	33	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3437	3	23	34	“Tell the Israelites, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Feast of Shelters for seven days to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3438	3	23	35	On the first day is a holy assembly; you must do no regular work.
3439	3	23	36	For seven days you must present a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. On the eighth day there is to be a holy assembly for you, and you must present a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. It is a solemn assembly day; you must not do any regular work.
3440	3	23	37	¶“‘These are the appointed times of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that you must proclaim as holy assemblies to present a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – burnt offering, grain offering, sacrifice, and drink offerings, each day according to its regulation,
3441	3	23	38	besides the Sabbaths of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and all your gifts, votive offerings, and freewill offerings which you must give to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3442	3	23	39	¶“‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you gather in the produce of the land, you must celebrate a pilgrim festival of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for seven days. On the first day is a complete rest and on the eighth day is complete rest.
3443	3	23	40	On the first day you must take for yourselves branches from majestic trees – palm branches, branches of leafy trees, and willows of the brook – and you must rejoice before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God for seven days.
3444	3	23	41	You must celebrate it as a pilgrim festival to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for seven days in the year. This is a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you must celebrate it in the seventh month.
3445	3	23	42	You must live in temporary shelters for seven days; every native citizen in Israel must live in shelters,
3446	3	23	43	so that your future generations may know that I made the Israelites live in shelters when I brought them out from the land of Egypt. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.’”
3447	3	23	44	¶So Moses spoke to the Israelites about the appointed times of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3448	3	24	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3449	3	24	2	“Command the Israelites to bring to you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, to make a lamp burn continually.
3450	3	24	3	Outside the special curtain of the congregation in the Meeting Tent Aaron must arrange it from evening until morning before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> continually. This is a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
3451	3	24	4	On the ceremonially pure lampstand he must arrange the lamps before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> continually.
3452	3	24	5	¶“You must take choice wheat flour and bake twelve loaves; there must be two tenths of an ephah of flour in each loaf,
3453	3	24	6	and you must set them in two rows, six in a row, on the ceremonially pure table before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3454	3	24	7	You must put pure frankincense on each row, and it will become a memorial portion for the bread, a gift to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3455	3	24	8	Each Sabbath day Aaron must arrange it before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> continually; this portion is from the Israelites as a perpetual covenant.
3456	3	24	9	It will belong to Aaron and his sons, and they must eat it in a holy place because it is most holy to him, a perpetual allotted portion from the gifts of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3457	3	24	10	¶Now an Israelite woman’s son whose father was an Egyptian went out among the Israelites, and the Israelite woman’s son and an Israelite man had a fight in the camp.
3458	3	24	11	The Israelite woman’s son misused the Name and cursed, so they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)
3459	3	24	12	So they placed him in custody until they were able to make a clear legal decision for themselves based on words from the mouth of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3460	3	24	13	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3461	3	24	14	“Bring the one who cursed outside the camp, and all who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the whole congregation is to stone him to death.
3462	3	24	15	Moreover, you are to tell the Israelites, ‘If any man curses his God he will bear responsibility for his sin,
3463	3	24	16	and one who misuses the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> must surely be put to death. The whole congregation must surely stone him, whether he is a resident foreigner or a native citizen; when he misuses the Name he must be put to death.
3464	3	24	17	¶“‘If a man beats any person to death, he must be put to death.
3465	3	24	18	One who beats an animal to death must make restitution for it, life for life.
3466	3	24	19	If a man inflicts an injury on his fellow citizen, just as he has done it must be done to him –
3467	3	24	20	fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth – just as he inflicts an injury on another person that same injury must be inflicted on him.
3468	3	24	21	One who beats an animal to death must make restitution for it, but one who beats a person to death must be put to death.
3469	3	24	22	There will be one regulation for you, whether a resident foreigner or a native citizen, for I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.’”
3470	3	24	23	¶Then Moses spoke to the Israelites and they brought the one who cursed outside the camp and stoned him with stones. So the Israelites did just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
3471	3	25	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai:
3472	3	25	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land must observe a Sabbath to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3473	3	25	3	Six years you may sow your field, and six years you may prune your vineyard and gather the produce,
3474	3	25	4	but in the seventh year the land must have a Sabbath of complete rest – a Sabbath to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. You must not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
3475	3	25	5	You must not gather in the aftergrowth of your harvest and you must not pick the grapes of your unpruned vines; the land must have a year of complete rest.
3476	3	25	6	You may have the Sabbath produce of the land to eat – you, your male servant, your female servant, your hired worker, the resident foreigner who stays with you,
3477	3	25	7	your cattle, and the wild animals that are in your land – all its produce will be for you to eat.
3478	3	25	8	¶“‘You must count off seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, and the days of the seven weeks of years will amount to forty-nine years.
3479	3	25	9	You must sound loud horn blasts – in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, on the Day of Atonement – you must sound the horn in your entire land.
3480	3	25	10	So you must consecrate the fiftieth year, and you must proclaim a release in the land for all its inhabitants. That year will be your jubilee; each one of you must return to his property and each one of you must return to his clan.
3481	3	25	11	That fiftieth year will be your jubilee; you must not sow the land, harvest its aftergrowth, or pick the grapes of its unpruned vines.
3482	3	25	12	Because that year is a jubilee, it will be holy to you – you may eat its produce from the field.
3483	3	25	13	¶“‘In this year of jubilee you must each return to your property.
3484	3	25	14	If you make a sale to your fellow citizen or buy from your fellow citizen, no one is to wrong his brother.
3485	3	25	15	You may buy it from your fellow citizen according to the number of years since the last jubilee; he may sell it to you according to the years of produce that are left.
3486	3	25	16	The more years there are, the more you may make its purchase price, and the fewer years there are, the less you must make its purchase price, because he is only selling to you a number of years of produce.
3487	3	25	17	No one is to oppress his fellow citizen, but you must fear your God, because I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
3488	3	25	18	You must obey my statutes and my regulations; you must be sure to keep them so that you may live securely in the land.
3489	3	25	19	¶“‘The land will give its fruit and you may eat until you are satisfied, and you may live securely in the land.
3490	3	25	20	If you say, ‘What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow and gather our produce?’
3491	3	25	21	I will command my blessing for you in the sixth year so that it may yield the produce for three years,
3492	3	25	22	and you may sow the eighth year and eat from that sixth year’s produce – old produce. Until you bring in the ninth year’s produce, you may eat old produce.
3493	3	25	23	The land must not be sold without reclaim because the land belongs to me, for you are foreign residents, temporary settlers, with me.
3494	3	25	24	In all your landed property you must provide for the right of redemption of the land.
3495	3	25	25	¶“‘If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his property, his near redeemer is to come to you and redeem what his brother sold.
3496	3	25	26	If a man has no redeemer, but he prospers and gains enough for its redemption,
3497	3	25	27	he is to calculate the value of the years it was sold, refund the balance to the man to whom he had sold it, and return to his property.
3498	3	25	28	If he has not prospered enough to refund a balance to him, then what he sold will belong to the one who bought it until the jubilee year, but it must revert in the jubilee and the original owner may return to his property.
3499	3	25	29	¶“‘If a man sells a residential house in a walled city, its right of redemption must extend until one full year from its sale; its right of redemption must extend to a full calendar year.
3500	3	25	30	If it is not redeemed before the full calendar year is ended, the house in the walled city will belong without reclaim to the one who bought it throughout his generations; it will not revert in the jubilee.
3501	3	25	31	The houses of villages, however, which have no wall surrounding them must be considered as the field of the land; they will have the right of redemption and must revert in the jubilee.
3502	3	25	32	As for the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities which they possess, the Levites must have a perpetual right of redemption.
3503	3	25	33	Whatever someone among the Levites might redeem – the sale of a house which is his property in a city – must revert in the jubilee, because the houses of the cities of the Levites are their property in the midst of the Israelites.
3504	3	25	34	Moreover, the open field areas of their cities must not be sold, because that is their perpetual possession.
3505	3	25	35	¶“‘If your brother becomes impoverished and is indebted to you, you must support him; he must live with you like a foreign resident.
3506	3	25	36	Do not take interest or profit from him, but you must fear your God and your brother must live with you.
3507	3	25	37	You must not lend him your money at interest and you must not sell him food for profit.
3508	3	25	38	I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan – to be your God.
3509	3	25	39	¶“‘If your brother becomes impoverished with regard to you so that he sells himself to you, you must not subject him to slave service.
3510	3	25	40	He must be with you as a hired worker, as a resident foreigner; he must serve with you until the year of jubilee,
3511	3	25	41	but then he may go free, he and his children with him, and may return to his family and to the property of his ancestors.
3512	3	25	42	Since they are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt, they must not be sold in a slave sale.
3513	3	25	43	You must not rule over him harshly, but you must fear your God.
3514	3	25	44	¶“‘As for your male and female slaves who may belong to you – you may buy male and female slaves from the nations all around you.
3515	3	25	45	Also you may buy slaves from the children of the foreigners who reside with you, and from their families that are with you, whom they have fathered in your land, they may become your property.
3516	3	25	46	You may give them as inheritance to your children after you to possess as property. You may enslave them perpetually. However, as for your brothers the Israelites, no man may rule over his brother harshly.
3517	3	25	47	¶“‘If a resident foreigner who is with you prospers and your brother becomes impoverished with regard to him so that he sells himself to a resident foreigner who is with you or to a member of a foreigner’s family,
3518	3	25	48	after he has sold himself he retains a right of redemption. One of his brothers may redeem him,
3519	3	25	49	or his uncle or his cousin may redeem him, or anyone of the rest of his blood relatives – his family – may redeem him, or if he prospers he may redeem himself.
3520	3	25	50	He must calculate with the one who bought him the number of years from the year he sold himself to him until the jubilee year, and the cost of his sale must correspond to the number of years, according to the rate of wages a hired worker would have earned while with him.
3521	3	25	51	If there are still many years, in keeping with them he must refund most of the cost of his purchase for his redemption,
3522	3	25	52	but if only a few years remain until the jubilee, he must calculate for himself in keeping with the remaining years and refund it for his redemption.
3523	3	25	53	He must be with the one who bought him like a yearly hired worker. The one who bought him must not rule over him harshly in your sight.
3524	3	25	54	If, however, he is not redeemed in these ways, he must go free in the jubilee year, he and his children with him,
3525	3	25	55	because the Israelites are my own servants; they are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
3526	3	26	1	¶“‘You must not make for yourselves idols, so you must not set up for yourselves a carved image or a pillar, and you must not place a sculpted stone in your land to bow down before it, for I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
3527	3	26	2	You must keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3528	3	26	3	¶“‘If you walk in my statutes and are sure to obey my commandments,
3529	3	26	4	I will give you your rains in their time so that the land will give its yield and the trees of the field will produce their fruit.
3530	3	26	5	Threshing season will extend for you until the season for harvesting grapes, and the season for harvesting grapes will extend until sowing season, so you will eat your bread until you are satisfied, and you will live securely in your land.
3531	3	26	6	I will grant peace in the land so that you will lie down to sleep without anyone terrifying you. I will remove harmful animals from the land, and no sword of war will pass through your land.
3532	3	26	7	You will pursue your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword.
3533	3	26	8	Five of you will pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you will pursue ten thousand, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword.
3534	3	26	9	I will turn to you, make you fruitful, multiply you, and maintain my covenant with you.
3535	3	26	10	You will still be eating stored produce from the previous year and will have to clean out what is stored from the previous year to make room for new.
3536	3	26	11	¶“‘I will put my tabernacle in your midst and I will not abhor you.
3537	3	26	12	I will walk among you, and I will be your God and you will be my people.
3538	3	26	13	I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from being their slaves, and I broke the bars of your yoke and caused you to walk upright.
3539	3	26	14	¶“‘If, however, you do not obey me and keep all these commandments –
3540	3	26	15	if you reject my statutes and abhor my regulations so that you do not keep all my commandments and you break my covenant –
3541	3	26	16	I for my part will do this to you: I will inflict horror on you, consumption and fever, which diminish eyesight and drain away the vitality of life. You will sow your seed in vain because your enemies will eat it.
3542	3	26	17	I will set my face against you. You will be struck down before your enemies, those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when there is no one pursuing you.
3543	3	26	18	¶“‘If, in spite of all these things, you do not obey me, I will discipline you seven times more on account of your sins.
3544	3	26	19	I will break your strong pride and make your sky like iron and your land like bronze.
3545	3	26	20	Your strength will be used up in vain, your land will not give its yield, and the trees of the land will not produce their fruit.
3546	3	26	21	¶“‘If you walk in hostility against me and are not willing to obey me, I will increase your affliction seven times according to your sins.
3547	3	26	22	I will send the wild animals against you and they will bereave you of your children, annihilate your cattle, and diminish your population so that your roads will become deserted.
3548	3	26	23	¶“‘If in spite of these things you do not allow yourselves to be disciplined and you walk in hostility against me,
3549	3	26	24	I myself will also walk in hostility against you and strike you seven times on account of your sins.
3550	3	26	25	I will bring on you an avenging sword, a covenant vengeance. Although you will gather together into your cities, I will send pestilence among you and you will be given into enemy hands.
3551	3	26	26	When I break off your supply of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven; they will ration your bread by weight, and you will eat and not be satisfied.

3556	3	26	31	I will lay your cities waste and make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will refuse to smell your soothing aromas.
3557	3	26	32	I myself will make the land desolate and your enemies who live in it will be appalled.
3558	3	26	33	I will scatter you among the nations and unsheathe the sword after you, so your land will become desolate and your cities will become a waste.
3559	3	26	34	¶“‘Then the land will make up for its Sabbaths all the days it lies desolate while you are in the land of your enemies; then the land will rest and make up its Sabbaths.
3560	3	26	35	All the days of the desolation it will have the rest it did not have on your Sabbaths when you lived on it.
3561	3	26	36	¶“‘As for the ones who remain among you, I will bring despair into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a blowing leaf will pursue them, and they will flee as one who flees the sword and fall down even though there is no pursuer.
3562	3	26	37	They will stumble over each other as those who flee before a sword, though there is no pursuer, and there will be no one to take a stand for you before your enemies.
3563	3	26	38	You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will consume you.
3564	3	26	39	¶“‘As for the ones who remain among you, they will rot away because of their iniquity in the lands of your enemies, and they will also rot away because of their ancestors’ iniquities which are with them.
3565	3	26	40	However, when they confess their iniquity and their ancestors’ iniquity which they committed by trespassing against me, by which they also walked in hostility against me
3566	3	26	41	(and I myself will walk in hostility against them and bring them into the land of their enemies), and then their uncircumcised hearts become humbled and they make up for their iniquity,
3567	3	26	42	I will remember my covenant with Jacob and also my covenant with Isaac and also my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
3568	3	26	43	The land will be abandoned by them in order that it may make up for its Sabbaths while it is made desolate without them, and they will make up for their iniquity because they have rejected my regulations and have abhorred my statutes.
3569	3	26	44	In spite of this, however, when they are in the land of their enemies I will not reject them and abhor them to make a complete end of them, to break my covenant with them, for I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God.
3570	3	26	45	I will remember for them the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out from the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3571	3	26	46	¶These are the statutes, regulations, and instructions which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> established between himself and the Israelites at Mount Sinai through Moses.
3572	3	27	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3573	3	27	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When a man makes a special votive offering based on the conversion value of persons to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
3574	3	27	3	the conversion value of the male from twenty years old up to sixty years old is fifty shekels by the standard of the sanctuary shekel.
3575	3	27	4	If the person is a female, the conversion value is thirty shekels.
3576	3	27	5	If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the conversion value of the male is twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
3577	3	27	6	If the person is one month old up to five years old, the conversion value of the male is five shekels of silver, and for the female the conversion value is three shekels of silver.
3578	3	27	7	If the person is from sixty years old and older, if he is a male the conversion value is fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
3579	3	27	8	If he is too poor to pay the conversion value, he must stand the person before the priest and the priest will establish his conversion value; according to what the man who made the vow can afford, the priest will establish his conversion value.
3580	3	27	9	¶“‘If what is vowed is a kind of animal from which an offering may be presented to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, anything which he gives to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from this kind of animal will be holy.
3581	3	27	10	He must not replace or exchange it, good for bad or bad for good, and if he does indeed exchange one animal for another animal, then both the original animal and its substitute will be holy.
3582	3	27	11	If what is vowed is an unclean animal from which an offering must not be presented to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, then he must stand the animal before the priest,
3583	3	27	12	and the priest will establish its conversion value, whether good or bad. According to the assessed conversion value of the priest, thus it will be.
3584	3	27	13	If, however, the person who made the vow redeems the animal, he must add one fifth to its conversion value.
3585	3	27	14	¶“‘If a man consecrates his house as holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the priest will establish its conversion value, whether good or bad. Just as the priest establishes its conversion value, thus it will stand.
3586	3	27	15	If the one who consecrates it redeems his house, he must add to it one fifth of its conversion value in silver, and it will belong to him.
3587	3	27	16	¶“‘If a man consecrates to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> some of his own landed property, the conversion value must be calculated in accordance with the amount of seed needed to sow it, a homer of barley seed being priced at fifty shekels of silver.
3588	3	27	17	If he consecrates his field in the jubilee year, the conversion value will stand,
3589	3	27	18	but if he consecrates his field after the jubilee, the priest will calculate the price for him according to the years that are left until the next jubilee year, and it will be deducted from the conversion value.
3590	3	27	19	If, however, the one who consecrated the field redeems it, he must add to it one fifth of the conversion price and it will belong to him.
3591	3	27	20	If he does not redeem the field, but sells the field to someone else, he may never redeem it.
3592	3	27	21	When it reverts in the jubilee, the field will be holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> like a permanently dedicated field; it will become the priest’s property.
3593	3	27	22	¶“‘If he consecrates to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> a field he has purchased, which is not part of his own landed property,
3594	3	27	23	the priest will calculate for him the amount of its conversion value until the jubilee year, and he must pay the conversion value on that jubilee day as something that is holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3595	3	27	24	In the jubilee year the field will return to the one from whom he bought it, the one to whom it belongs as landed property.
3596	3	27	25	Every conversion value must be calculated by the standard of the sanctuary shekel; twenty gerahs to the shekel.
3597	3	27	26	¶“‘Surely no man may consecrate a firstborn that already belongs to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as a firstborn among the animals; whether it is an ox or a sheep, it belongs to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3598	3	27	27	If, however, it is among the unclean animals, he may ransom it according to its conversion value and must add one fifth to it, but if it is not redeemed it must be sold according to its conversion value.
3599	3	27	28	¶“‘Surely anything which a man permanently dedicates to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from all that belongs to him, whether from people, animals, or his landed property, must be neither sold nor redeemed; anything permanently dedicated is most holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3600	3	27	29	Any human being who is permanently dedicated must not be ransomed; such a person must be put to death.
3601	3	27	30	¶“‘Any tithe of the land, from the grain of the land or from the fruit of the trees, belongs to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; it is holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3602	3	27	31	If a man redeems part of his tithe, however, he must add one fifth to it.
3603	3	27	32	All the tithe of herd or flock, everything which passes under the rod, the tenth one will be holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3604	3	27	33	The owner must not examine the animals to distinguish between good and bad, and he must not exchange it. If, however, he does exchange it, both the original animal and its substitute will be holy. It must not be redeemed.’”
3605	3	27	34	¶These are the commandments which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses to tell the Israelites at Mount Sinai.
3606	4	1	1	¶Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting in the desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites departed from the land of Egypt. He said:
3607	4	1	2	“Take a census of the entire Israelite community by their clans and families, counting the name of every individual male.
3608	4	1	3	You and Aaron are to number all in Israel who can serve in the army, those who are twenty years old or older, by their divisions.
3609	4	1	4	And to help you there is to be a man from each tribe, each man the head of his family.
3610	4	1	5	Now these are the names of the men who are to help you:‡from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;
3611	4	1	6	‡from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;
3612	4	1	7	‡from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab;
3613	4	1	8	‡from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;
3614	4	1	9	‡from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon;
3615	4	1	10	‡from the sons of Joseph:‡from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud;‡from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur;
3616	4	1	11	‡from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni;
3617	4	1	12	‡from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai;
3618	4	1	13	‡from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran;
3619	4	1	14	‡from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel;
3620	4	1	15	‡from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.”
3621	4	1	16	¶These were the ones chosen from the community, leaders of their ancestral tribes. They were the heads of the thousands of Israel.
3622	4	1	17	¶So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been mentioned specifically by name,
3623	4	1	18	and they assembled the entire community together on the first day of the second month. Then the people recorded their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men who were twenty years old or older were listed by name individually,
3624	4	1	19	just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses. And so he numbered them in the desert of Sinai.
3625	4	1	20	¶And they were as follows:¶The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name individually.
3626	4	1	21	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Reuben were 46,500.
3627	4	1	22	¶From the descendants of Simeon: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males numbered of them twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name individually.
3628	4	1	23	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Simeon were 59,300.
3629	4	1	24	¶From the descendants of Gad: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name.
3630	4	1	25	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Gad were 45,650.
3631	4	1	26	¶From the descendants of Judah: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name.
3632	4	1	27	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Judah were 74,600.
3633	4	1	28	¶From the descendants of Issachar: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name.
3634	4	1	29	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Issachar were 54,400.
3635	4	1	30	¶From the descendants of Zebulun: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name.
3636	4	1	31	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Zebulun were 57,400.
3637	4	1	32	¶From the sons of Joseph: ¶From the descendants of Ephraim: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name.
3638	4	1	33	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Ephraim were 40,500.
3639	4	1	34	From the descendants of Manasseh: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name.
3640	4	1	35	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Manasseh were 32,200.
3641	4	1	36	¶From the descendants of Benjamin: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name.
3642	4	1	37	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Benjamin were 35,400.
3643	4	1	38	¶From the descendants of Dan: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name.
3644	4	1	39	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Dan were 62,700.
3645	4	1	40	¶From the descendants of Asher: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name.
3646	4	1	41	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Asher were 41,500.
3647	4	1	42	¶From the descendants of Naphtali: According to the records of their clans and families, all the males twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were listed by name.
3648	4	1	43	Those of them who were numbered from the tribe of Naphtali were 53,400.
3649	4	1	44	¶These were the men whom Moses and Aaron numbered along with the twelve leaders of Israel, each of whom was from his own family.
3650	4	1	45	All the Israelites who were twenty years old or older, who could serve in Israel’s army, were numbered according to their families.
3651	4	1	46	And all those numbered totaled 603,550.
3652	4	1	47	¶But the Levites, according to the tribe of their fathers, were not numbered among them.
3653	4	1	48	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had said to Moses,
3654	4	1	49	“Only the tribe of Levi you must not number or count with the other Israelites.
3655	4	1	50	But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, over all its furnishings and over everything in it. They must carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; and they must attend to it and camp around it.
3656	4	1	51	Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites must take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be reassembled, the Levites must set it up. Any unauthorized person who approaches it must be killed.
3657	4	1	52	¶“The Israelites will camp according to their divisions, each man in his camp, and each man by his standard.
3658	4	1	53	But the Levites must camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s anger will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the testimony.”
3659	4	1	54	¶The Israelites did according to all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses – that is what they did.
3660	4	2	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and to Aaron:
3661	4	2	2	“Every one of the Israelites must camp under his standard with the emblems of his family; they must camp at some distance around the tent of meeting.
3662	4	2	3	¶“Now those who will be camping on the east, toward the sunrise, are the divisions of the camp of Judah under their standard. The leader of the people of Judah is Nahshon son of Amminadab.
3663	4	2	4	Those numbered in his division are 74,600.
3664	4	2	5	Those who will be camping next to them are the tribe of Issachar. The leader of the people of Issachar is Nethanel son of Zuar.
3665	4	2	6	Those numbered in his division are 54,400.
3666	4	2	7	Next will be the tribe of Zebulun. The leader of the people of Zebulun is Eliab son of Helon.
3667	4	2	8	Those numbered in his division are 57,400.
3668	4	2	9	All those numbered of the camp of Judah, according to their divisions, are 186,400. They will travel at the front.
3669	4	2	10	¶“On the south will be the divisions of the camp of Reuben under their standard. The leader of the people of Reuben is Elizur son of Shedeur.
3670	4	2	11	Those numbered in his division are 46,500.
3671	4	2	12	Those who will be camping next to them are the tribe of Simeon. The leader of the people of Simeon is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
3672	4	2	13	Those numbered in his division are 59,300.
3673	4	2	14	Next will be the tribe of Gad. The leader of the people of Gad is Eliasaph son of Deuel.
3674	4	2	15	Those numbered in his division are 45,650.
3675	4	2	16	All those numbered of the camp of Reuben, according to their divisions, are 151,450. They will travel second.
3676	4	2	17	¶“Then the tent of meeting with the camp of the Levites will travel in the middle of the camps. They will travel in the same order as they camped, each in his own place under his standard.
3677	4	2	18	¶“On the west will be the divisions of the camp of Ephraim under their standard. The leader of the people of Ephraim is Elishama son of Ammihud.
3678	4	2	19	Those numbered in his division are 40,500.
3679	4	2	20	Next to them will be the tribe of Manasseh. The leader of the people of Manasseh is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
3680	4	2	21	Those numbered in his division are 32,200.
3681	4	2	22	Next will be the tribe of Benjamin. The leader of the people of Benjamin is Abidan son of Gideoni.
3682	4	2	23	Those numbered in his division are 35,400.
3683	4	2	24	All those numbered of the camp of Ephraim, according to their divisions, are 108,100. They will travel third.
3684	4	2	25	¶“On the north will be the divisions of the camp of Dan, under their standards. The leader of the people of Dan is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
3685	4	2	26	Those numbered in his division are 62,700.
3686	4	2	27	Those who will be camping next to them are the tribe of Asher. The leader of the people of Asher is Pagiel son of Ocran.
3687	4	2	28	Those numbered in his division are 41,500.
3688	4	2	29	Next will be the tribe of Naphtali. The leader of the people of Naphtali is Ahira son of Enan.
3689	4	2	30	Those numbered in his division are 53,400.
3690	4	2	31	All those numbered of the camp of Dan are 157,600. They will travel last, under their standards.”
3691	4	2	32	¶These are the Israelites, numbered according to their families. All those numbered in the camps, by their divisions, are 603,550.
3692	4	2	33	But the Levites were not numbered among the other Israelites, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses.
3693	4	2	34	¶So the Israelites did according to all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses; that is the way they camped under their standards, and that is the way they traveled, each with his clan and family.
3694	4	3	1	¶Now these are the records of Aaron and Moses when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
3695	4	3	2	These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab, the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
3696	4	3	3	These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he consecrated to minister as priests.
3697	4	3	4	¶Nadab and Abihu died before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> when they offered strange fire before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the desert of Sinai, and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar ministered as priests in the presence of Aaron their father.
3698	4	3	5	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3699	4	3	6	“Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him.
3700	4	3	7	They are responsible for his needs and the needs of the whole community before the tent of meeting, by attending to the service of the tabernacle.
3701	4	3	8	And they are responsible for all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, and for the needs of the Israelites, as they serve in the tabernacle.
3702	4	3	9	You are to assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they will be assigned exclusively to him out of all the Israelites.
3703	4	3	10	So you are to appoint Aaron and his sons, and they will be responsible for their priesthood, but the unauthorized person who comes near must be put to death.”
3704	4	3	11	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3705	4	3	12	“Look, I myself have taken the Levites from among the Israelites instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the Israelites. So the Levites belong to me,
3706	4	3	13	because all the firstborn are mine. When I destroyed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I set apart for myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They belong to me. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
3707	4	3	14	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai:
3708	4	3	15	“Number the Levites by their clans and their families; every male from a month old and upward you are to number.”
3709	4	3	16	So Moses numbered them according to the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, just as he had been commanded.
3710	4	3	17	¶These were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
3711	4	3	18	¶These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.
3712	4	3	19	The sons of Kohath by their families were: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
3713	4	3	20	The sons of Merari by their families were Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites by their clans.
3714	4	3	21	¶From Gershon came the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites; these were the families of the Gershonites.
3715	4	3	22	Those of them who were numbered, counting every male from a month old and upward, were 7,500.
3716	4	3	23	The families of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle toward the west.
3717	4	3	24	Now the leader of the clan of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.
3718	4	3	25	¶And the responsibilities of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting included the tabernacle, the tent with its covering, the curtain at the entrance of the tent of meeting,
3719	4	3	26	the hangings of the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard that surrounded the tabernacle and the altar, and their ropes, plus all the service connected with these things.
3720	4	3	27	¶From Kohath came the family of the Amramites, the family of the Izharites, the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites.
3721	4	3	28	Counting every male from a month old and upward, there were 8,600. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
3722	4	3	29	The families of the Kohathites were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.
3723	4	3	30	Now the leader of the clan of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
3724	4	3	31	¶Their responsibilities included the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, and the utensils of the sanctuary with which they ministered, the curtain, and all their service.
3725	4	3	32	Now the head of all the Levitical leaders was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the sanctuary.
3726	4	3	33	¶From Merari came the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites; these were the families of Merari.
3727	4	3	34	Those of them who were numbered, counting every male from a month old and upward, were 6,200.
3728	4	3	35	Now the leader of the clan of the families of Merari was Zuriel son of Abihail. These were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
3729	4	3	36	¶The appointed responsibilities of the Merarites included the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, its posts, its sockets, its utensils, plus all the service connected with these things,
3730	4	3	37	and the pillars of the courtyard all around, with their sockets, their pegs, and their ropes.
3731	4	3	38	¶But those who were to camp in front of the tabernacle on the east, in front of the tent of meeting, were Moses, Aaron, and his sons. They were responsible for the needs of the sanctuary and for the needs of the Israelites, but the unauthorized person who approached was to be put to death.
3732	4	3	39	All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered by the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, according to their families, every male from a month old and upward, were 22,000.
3733	4	3	40	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Number all the firstborn males of the Israelites from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.
3734	4	3	41	And take the Levites for me – I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – instead of all the firstborn males among the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites.”
3735	4	3	42	So Moses numbered all the firstborn males among the Israelites, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded him.
3736	4	3	43	And all the firstborn males, by the number of the names from a month old and upward, totaled 22,273.
3737	4	3	44	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3738	4	3	45	“Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn males among the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock. And the Levites will be mine. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3739	4	3	46	And for the redemption of the 273 firstborn males of the Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,
3740	4	3	47	collect five shekels for each one individually; you are to collect this amount in the currency of the sanctuary shekel (this shekel is twenty gerahs).
3741	4	3	48	And give the money for the redemption of the excess number of them to Aaron and his sons.”
3742	4	3	49	¶So Moses took the redemption money from those who were in excess of those redeemed by the Levites.
3743	4	3	50	From the firstborn males of the Israelites he collected the money, 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
3744	4	3	51	Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, according to the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
3745	4	4	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron:
3746	4	4	2	“Take a census of the Kohathites from among the Levites, by their families and by their clans,
3747	4	4	3	from thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, all who enter the company to do the work in the tent of meeting.
3748	4	4	4	This is the service of the Kohathites in the tent of meeting, relating to the most holy things.
3749	4	4	5	When it is time for the camp to journey, Aaron and his sons must come and take down the screening curtain and cover the ark of the testimony with it.
3750	4	4	6	Then they must put over it a covering of fine leather and spread over that a cloth entirely of blue, and then they must insert its poles.
3751	4	4	7	¶“On the table of the presence they must spread a blue cloth, and put on it the dishes, the pans, the bowls, and the pitchers for pouring, and the Bread of the Presence must be on it continually.
3752	4	4	8	They must spread over them a scarlet cloth, and cover the same with a covering of fine leather; and they must insert its poles.
3753	4	4	9	¶“They must take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand of the light, with its lamps, its wick-trimmers, its trays, and all its oil vessels, with which they service it.
3754	4	4	10	Then they must put it with all its utensils in a covering of fine leather, and put it on a carrying beam.
3755	4	4	11	¶“They must spread a blue cloth on the gold altar, and cover it with a covering of fine leather; and they must insert its poles.
3756	4	4	12	Then they must take all the utensils of the service, with which they serve in the sanctuary, put them in a blue cloth, cover them with a covering of fine leather, and put them on a carrying beam.
3757	4	4	13	Also, they must take away the ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
3758	4	4	14	Then they must place on it all its implements with which they serve there – the trays, the meat forks, the shovels, the basins, and all the utensils of the altar – and they must spread on it a covering of fine leather, and then insert its poles.
3759	4	4	15	¶“When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is ready to journey, then the Kohathites will come to carry them; but they must not touch any holy thing, or they will die. These are the responsibilities of the Kohathites with the tent of meeting.
3760	4	4	16	¶“The appointed responsibility of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest is for the oil for the light, and the spiced incense, and the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil; he also has the appointed responsibility over all the tabernacle with all that is in it, over the sanctuary and over all its furnishings.”
3761	4	4	17	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron:
3762	4	4	18	“Do not allow the tribe of the families of the Kohathites to be cut off from among the Levites;
3763	4	4	19	but in order that they will live and not die when they approach the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and his sons will go in and appoint each man to his service and his responsibility.
3764	4	4	20	But the Kohathites are not to go in to watch while the holy things are being covered, or they will die.”
3765	4	4	21	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3766	4	4	22	“Also take a census of the Gershonites, by their clans and by their families.
3767	4	4	23	You must number them from thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, all who enter the company to do the work of the tent of meeting.
3768	4	4	24	This is the service of the families of Gershonites, as they serve and carry it.
3769	4	4	25	They must carry the curtains for the tabernacle and the tent of meeting with its covering, the covering of fine leather that is over it, the curtains for the entrance of the tent of meeting,
3770	4	4	26	the hangings for the courtyard, the curtain for the entrance of the gate of the court, which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their ropes, along with all the furnishings for their service and everything that is made for them. So they are to serve.
3771	4	4	27	¶“All the service of the Gershonites, whether carrying loads or for any of their work, will be at the direction of Aaron and his sons. You will assign them all their tasks as their responsibility.
3772	4	4	28	This is the service of the families of the Gershonites concerning the tent of meeting. Their responsibilities will be under the authority of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
3773	4	4	29	¶“As for the sons of Merari, you are to number them by their families and by their clans.
3774	4	4	30	You must number them from thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, all who enter the company to do the work of the tent of meeting.
3775	4	4	31	This is what they are responsible to carry as their entire service in the tent of meeting: the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, its posts, its sockets,
3776	4	4	32	and the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their sockets, tent pegs, and ropes, along with all their furnishings and everything for their service. You are to assign by names the items that each man is responsible to carry.
3777	4	4	33	This is the service of the families of the Merarites, their entire service concerning the tent of meeting, under the authority of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.”
3778	4	4	34	¶So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the community numbered the Kohathites by their families and by clans,
3779	4	4	35	from thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, everyone who entered the company for the work in the tent of meeting;
3780	4	4	36	and those of them numbered by their families were 2,750.
3781	4	4	37	These were those numbered from the families of the Kohathites, everyone who served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by the authority of Moses.
3782	4	4	38	¶Those numbered from the Gershonites, by their families and by their clans,
3783	4	4	39	from thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, everyone who entered the company for the work in the tent of meeting –
3784	4	4	40	those of them numbered by their families, by their clans, were 2,630.
3785	4	4	41	These were those numbered from the families of the Gershonites, everyone who served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3786	4	4	42	¶Those numbered from the families of the Merarites, by their families, by their clans,
3787	4	4	43	from thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, everyone who entered the company for the work in the tent of meeting –
3788	4	4	44	those of them numbered by their families were 3,200.
3789	4	4	45	These are those numbered from the families of the Merarites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by the authority of Moses.
3790	4	4	46	¶All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel numbered by their families and by their clans,
3791	4	4	47	from thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, everyone who entered to do the work of service and the work of carrying relating to the tent of meeting –
3792	4	4	48	those of them numbered were 8,580.
3793	4	4	49	According to the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> they were numbered, by the authority of Moses, each according to his service and according to what he was to carry. Thus were they numbered by him, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
3794	4	5	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3795	4	5	2	“Command the Israelites to expel from the camp every leper, everyone who has a discharge, and whoever becomes defiled by a corpse.
3796	4	5	3	You must expel both men and women; you must put them outside the camp, so that they will not defile their camps, among which I live.”
3797	4	5	4	So the Israelites did so, and expelled them outside the camp. As the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had spoken to Moses, so the Israelites did.
3798	4	5	5	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3799	4	5	6	“Tell the Israelites, ‘When a man or a woman commits any sin that people commit, thereby breaking faith with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and that person is found guilty,
3800	4	5	7	then he must confess his sin that he has committed and must make full reparation, add one fifth to it, and give it to whomever he wronged.
3801	4	5	8	But if the individual has no close relative to whom reparation can be made for the wrong, the reparation for the wrong must be paid to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement by which atonement is made for him.
3802	4	5	9	Every offering of all the Israelites’ holy things that they bring to the priest will be his.
3803	4	5	10	Every man’s holy things will be his; whatever any man gives the priest will be his.’”
3804	4	5	11	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3805	4	5	12	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘If any man’s wife goes astray and behaves unfaithfully toward him,
3806	4	5	13	and a man goes to bed with her, for sexual relations, without her husband knowing it, and it is hidden that she has defiled herself, since there was no witness against her, nor was she caught –
3807	4	5	14	and if jealous feelings come over him and he becomes suspicious of his wife, when she is defiled; or if jealous feelings come over him and he becomes suspicious of his wife, when she is not defiled –
3808	4	5	15	then the man must bring his wife to the priest, and he must bring the offering required for her, one tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he must not pour olive oil on it or put frankincense on it, because it is a grain offering of suspicion, a grain offering for remembering, for bringing iniquity to remembrance.
3809	4	5	16	¶“‘Then the priest will bring her near and have her stand before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3810	4	5	17	The priest will then take holy water in a pottery jar, and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle, and put it into the water.
3811	4	5	18	Then the priest will have the woman stand before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, uncover the woman’s head, and put the grain offering for remembering in her hands, which is the grain offering of suspicion. The priest will hold in his hand the bitter water that brings a curse.
3812	4	5	19	Then the priest will put the woman under oath and say to her, “If no other man has gone to bed with you, and if you have not gone astray and become defiled while under your husband’s authority, may you be free from this bitter water that brings a curse.
3813	4	5	20	But if you have gone astray while under your husband’s authority, and if you have defiled yourself and some man other than your husband has had sexual relations with you….”
3814	4	5	21	Then the priest will put the woman under the oath of the curse and will say to her, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> make you an attested curse among your people, if the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> makes your thigh fall away and your abdomen swell;
3815	4	5	22	and this water that causes the curse will go into your stomach, and make your abdomen swell and your thigh rot.” Then the woman must say, “Amen, amen.”
3816	4	5	23	¶“‘Then the priest will write these curses on a scroll and then scrape them off into the bitter water.
3817	4	5	24	He will make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and the water that brings a curse will enter her to produce bitterness.
3818	4	5	25	The priest will take the grain offering of suspicion from the woman’s hand, wave the grain offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and bring it to the altar.
3819	4	5	26	Then the priest will take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial portion, burn it on the altar, and afterward make the woman drink the water.
3820	4	5	27	When he has made her drink the water, then, if she has defiled herself and behaved unfaithfully toward her husband, the water that brings a curse will enter her to produce bitterness – her abdomen will swell, her thigh will fall away, and the woman will become a curse among her people.
3821	4	5	28	But if the woman has not defiled herself, and is clean, then she will be free of ill effects and will be able to bear children.
3822	4	5	29	¶“‘This is the law for cases of jealousy, when a wife, while under her husband’s authority, goes astray and defiles herself,
3823	4	5	30	or when jealous feelings come over a man and he becomes suspicious of his wife; then he must have the woman stand before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the priest will carry out all this law upon her.
3824	4	5	31	Then the man will be free from iniquity, but that woman will bear the consequences of her iniquity.’”
3825	4	6	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3826	4	6	2	“Speak to the Israelites, and tell them, ‘When either a man or a woman takes a special vow, to take a vow as a Nazirite, to separate himself to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
3827	4	6	3	he must separate himself from wine and strong drink, he must drink neither vinegar made from wine nor vinegar made from strong drink, nor may he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or raisins.
3828	4	6	4	All the days of his separation he must not eat anything that is produced by the grapevine, from seed to skin.
3829	4	6	5	¶“‘All the days of the vow of his separation no razor may be used on his head until the time is fulfilled for which he separated himself to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He will be holy, and he must let the locks of hair on his head grow long.
3830	4	6	6	¶“‘All the days that he separates himself to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> he must not contact a dead body.
3831	4	6	7	He must not defile himself even for his father or his mother or his brother or his sister if they die, because the separation for his God is on his head.
3832	4	6	8	All the days of his separation he must be holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3833	4	6	9	¶“‘If anyone dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his consecrated head, then he must shave his head on the day of his purification – on the seventh day he must shave it.
3834	4	6	10	On the eighth day he is to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the entrance to the tent of meeting.
3835	4	6	11	Then the priest will offer one for a purification offering and the other as a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because of his transgression in regard to the corpse. So he must reconsecrate his head on that day.
3836	4	6	12	He must rededicate to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> the days of his separation and bring a male lamb in its first year as a reparation offering, but the former days will not be counted because his separation was defiled.
3837	4	6	13	¶“‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite: When the days of his separation are fulfilled, he must be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
3838	4	6	14	and he must present his offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: one male lamb in its first year without blemish for a burnt offering, one ewe lamb in its first year without blemish for a purification offering, one ram without blemish for a peace offering,
3839	4	6	15	and a basket of bread made without yeast, cakes of fine flour mixed with olive oil, wafers made without yeast and smeared with olive oil, and their grain offering and their drink offerings.
3840	4	6	16	¶“‘Then the priest must present all these before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and offer his purification offering and his burnt offering.
3841	4	6	17	Then he must offer the ram as a peace offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, with the basket of bread made without yeast; the priest must also offer his grain offering and his drink offering.
3842	4	6	18	¶“‘Then the Nazirite must shave his consecrated head at the entrance to the tent of meeting and must take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire where the peace offering is burning.
3843	4	6	19	And the priest must take the boiled shoulder of the ram, one cake made without yeast from the basket, and one wafer made without yeast, and put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his consecrated head;
3844	4	6	20	then the priest must wave them as a wave offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; it is a holy portion for the priest, together with the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the raised offering. After this the Nazirite may drink wine.’
3845	4	6	21	¶“This is the law of the Nazirite who vows to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his offering according to his separation, as well as whatever else he can provide. Thus he must fulfill his vow that he makes, according to the law of his separation.”
3846	4	6	22	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3847	4	6	23	“Tell Aaron and his sons, ‘This is the way you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them:
3848	4	6	24	‡“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> bless you and protect you;
3849	4	6	25	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> make his face to shine upon you,‡and be gracious to you;
3850	4	6	26	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lift up his countenance upon you ‡and give you peace.”’
3851	4	6	27	¶So they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.”
3852	4	7	1	¶When Moses had completed setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings, and he anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils.
3853	4	7	2	Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their clans, made an offering. They were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who had been supervising the numbering.
3854	4	7	3	They brought their offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, six covered carts and twelve oxen – one cart for every two of the leaders, and an ox for each one; and they presented them in front of the tabernacle.
3855	4	7	4	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3856	4	7	5	“Receive these gifts from them, that they may be used in doing the work of the tent of meeting; and you must give them to the Levites, to every man as his service requires.”
3857	4	7	6	¶So Moses accepted the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
3858	4	7	7	He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their service required;
3859	4	7	8	and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their service required, under the authority of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
3860	4	7	9	But to the Kohathites he gave none, because the service of the holy things, which they carried on their shoulders, was their responsibility.
3861	4	7	10	¶The leaders offered gifts for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed. And the leaders presented their offering before the altar.
3862	4	7	11	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “They must present their offering, one leader for each day, for the dedication of the altar.”
3863	4	7	12	¶The one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab, from the tribe of Judah.
3864	4	7	13	His offering was one silver platter weighing 130 shekels, and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing 70 shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each of them full of fine flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering;
3865	4	7	14	one gold pan weighing 10 shekels, full of incense;
3866	4	7	15	one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year, for a burnt offering;
3867	4	7	16	one male goat for a purification offering;
3868	4	7	17	and for the sacrifice of peace offerings: two bulls, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs in their first year. This was the offering of Nahshon son of Amminadab.
3869	4	7	18	¶On the second day Nethanel son of Zuar, leader of Issachar, presented an offering.
3870	4	7	19	He offered for his offering one silver platter weighing 130 shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing 70 shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each of them full of fine flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering;
3871	4	7	20	one gold pan weighing 10 shekels, full of incense;
3872	4	7	21	one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year, for a burnt offering;
3873	4	7	22	one male goat for a purification offering;
3874	4	7	23	and for the sacrifice of peace offerings: two bulls, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs in their first year. This was the offering of Nethanel son of Zuar.
3875	4	7	24	¶On the third day Eliab son of Helon, leader of the Zebulunites, presented an offering.
3876	4	7	25	His offering was one silver platter weighing 130 shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing 70 shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each of them full of fine flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering;
3877	4	7	26	one gold pan weighing 10 shekels, full of incense;
3878	4	7	27	one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year, for a burnt offering;
3879	4	7	28	one male goat for a purification offering;
3880	4	7	29	and for the sacrifice of peace offerings: two bulls, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs in their first year. This was the offering of Eliab son of Helon.
3881	4	7	30	¶On the fourth day Elizur son of Shedeur, leader of the Reubenites, presented an offering.
3882	4	7	31	His offering was one silver platter weighing 130 shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing 70 shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each of them full of fine flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering;
3883	4	7	32	one gold pan weighing 10 shekels, full of incense;
3884	4	7	33	one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year, for a burnt offering;
3885	4	7	34	one male goat for a purification offering;

3940	4	7	89	¶Now when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the atonement lid that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim. Thus he spoke to him.
3941	4	8	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3942	4	8	2	“Speak to Aaron and tell him, ‘When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps are to give light in front of the lampstand.’”
3943	4	8	3	¶And Aaron did so; he set up the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses.
3944	4	8	4	This is how the lampstand was made: It was beaten work in gold; from its shaft to its flowers it was beaten work. According to the pattern which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.
3945	4	8	5	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3946	4	8	6	“Take the Levites from among the Israelites and purify them.
3947	4	8	7	And do this to them to purify them: Sprinkle water of purification on them; then have them shave all their body and wash their clothes, and so purify themselves.
3948	4	8	8	Then they are to take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with olive oil; and you are to take a second young bull for a purification offering.
3949	4	8	9	You are to bring the Levites before the tent of meeting and assemble the entire community of the Israelites.
3950	4	8	10	Then you are to bring the Levites before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the Israelites are to lay their hands on the Levites;
3951	4	8	11	and Aaron is to offer the Levites before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as a wave offering from the Israelites, that they may do the work of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3952	4	8	12	When the Levites lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, offer the one for a purification offering and the other for a whole burnt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, to make atonement for the Levites.
3953	4	8	13	You are to have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons, and then offer them as a wave offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3954	4	8	14	And so you are to separate the Levites from among the Israelites, and the Levites will be mine.
3955	4	8	15	¶“After this, the Levites will go in to do the work of the tent of meeting. So you must cleanse them and offer them like a wave offering.
3956	4	8	16	For they are entirely given to me from among the Israelites. I have taken them for myself instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn sons of all the Israelites.
3957	4	8	17	For all the firstborn males among the Israelites are mine, both humans and animals; when I destroyed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I set them apart for myself.
3958	4	8	18	So I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn sons among the Israelites.
3959	4	8	19	I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to do the work for the Israelites in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the Israelites, so there will be no plague among the Israelites when the Israelites come near the sanctuary.”
3960	4	8	20	¶So Moses and Aaron and the entire community of the Israelites did this with the Levites. According to all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses concerning the Levites, this is what the Israelites did with them.
3961	4	8	21	The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothing; then Aaron presented them like a wave offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and Aaron made atonement for them to purify them.
3962	4	8	22	After this, the Levites went in to do their work in the tent of meeting before Aaron and before his sons. As the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did.
3963	4	8	23	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3964	4	8	24	“This is what pertains to the Levites: At the age of twenty-five years and upward one may begin to join the company in the work of the tent of meeting,
3965	4	8	25	and at the age of fifty years they must retire from performing the work and may no longer work.
3966	4	8	26	They may assist their colleagues in the tent of meeting, to attend to needs, but they must do no work. This is the way you must establish the Levites regarding their duties.”
3967	4	9	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt:
3968	4	9	2	¶“The Israelites are to observe the Passover at its appointed time.
3969	4	9	3	In the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you are to observe it at its appointed time; you must keep it in accordance with all its statutes and all its customs.”
3970	4	9	4	So Moses instructed the Israelites to observe the Passover.
3971	4	9	5	And they observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at twilight in the desert of Sinai; in accordance with all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses, so the Israelites did.
3972	4	9	6	¶It happened that some men who were ceremonially defiled by the dead body of a man could not keep the Passover on that day, so they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.
3973	4	9	7	And those men said to him, “We are ceremonially defiled by the dead body of a man; why are we kept back from offering the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s offering at its appointed time among the Israelites?”
3974	4	9	8	So Moses said to them, “Remain here and I will hear what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will command concerning you.”
3975	4	9	9	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3976	4	9	10	“Tell the Israelites, ‘If any of you or of your posterity become ceremonially defiled by touching a dead body, or are on a journey far away, then he may observe the Passover to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
3977	4	9	11	They may observe it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight; they are to eat it with bread made without yeast and with bitter herbs.
3978	4	9	12	They must not leave any of it until morning, nor break any of its bones; they must observe it in accordance with every statute of the Passover.
3979	4	9	13	¶But the man who is ceremonially clean, and was not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that person must be cut off from his people. Because he did not bring the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s offering at its appointed time, that man must bear his sin.
3980	4	9	14	If a resident foreigner lives among you and wants to keep the Passover to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he must do so according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its custom. You must have the same statute for the resident foreigner and for the one who was born in the land.’”
3981	4	9	15	¶On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle – the tent of the testimony – and from evening until morning there was a fiery appearance over the tabernacle.
3982	4	9	16	This is the way it used to be continually: The cloud would cover it by day, and there was a fiery appearance by night.
3983	4	9	17	Whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the Israelites would begin their journey; and in whatever place the cloud settled, there the Israelites would make camp.
3984	4	9	18	At the commandment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> the Israelites would begin their journey, and at the commandment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> they would make camp; as long as the cloud remained settled over the tabernacle they would camp.
3985	4	9	19	When the cloud remained over the tabernacle many days, then the Israelites obeyed the instructions of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and did not journey.
3986	4	9	20	¶When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a number of days, they remained camped according to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commandment, and according to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commandment they would journey.
3987	4	9	21	And when the cloud remained only from evening until morning, when the cloud was taken up the following morning, then they traveled on. Whether by day or by night, when the cloud was taken up they traveled.
3988	4	9	22	Whether it was for two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud prolonged its stay over the tabernacle, the Israelites remained camped without traveling; but when it was taken up, they traveled on.
3989	4	9	23	At the commandment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> they camped, and at the commandment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> they traveled on; they kept the instructions of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> according to the commandment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, by the authority of Moses.
3990	4	10	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
3991	4	10	2	“Make two trumpets of silver; you are to make them from a single hammered piece. You will use them for assembling the community and for directing the traveling of the camps.
3992	4	10	3	When they blow them both, all the community must come to you to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
3993	4	10	4	¶“But if they blow with one trumpet, then the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Israel, must come to you.
3994	4	10	5	When you blow an alarm, then the camps that are located on the east side must begin to travel.
3995	4	10	6	And when you blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that are located on the south side must begin to travel. An alarm must be sounded for their journeys.
3996	4	10	7	But when you assemble the community, you must blow, but you must not sound an alarm.
3997	4	10	8	The sons of Aaron, the priests, must blow the trumpets; and they will be to you for an eternal ordinance throughout your generations.
3998	4	10	9	If you go to war in your land against an adversary who opposes you, then you must sound an alarm with the trumpets, and you will be remembered before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.
3999	4	10	10	¶“Also in the time when you rejoice, such as on your appointed festivals or at the beginnings of your months, you must blow with your trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings, so that they may become a memorial for you before your God: I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.”
4000	4	10	11	¶On the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle of the testimony.
4001	4	10	12	So the Israelites set out on their journeys from the desert of Sinai; and the cloud settled in the wilderness of Paran.
4002	4	10	13	¶This was the first time they set out on their journey according to the commandment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, by the authority of Moses.
4003	4	10	14	¶The standard of the camp of the Judahites set out first according to their companies, and over his company was Nahshon son of Amminadab.
4004	4	10	15	¶Over the company of the tribe of Issacharites was Nathanel son of Zuar,
4005	4	10	16	and over the company of the tribe of the Zebulunites was Eliab son of Helon.
4006	4	10	17	Then the tabernacle was dismantled, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out, carrying the tabernacle.
4007	4	10	18	¶The standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their companies; over his company was Elizur son of Shedeur.
4008	4	10	19	Over the company of the tribe of the Simeonites was Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai,
4009	4	10	20	and over the company of the tribe of the Gadites was Eliasaph son of Deuel.
4010	4	10	21	And the Kohathites set out, carrying the articles for the sanctuary; the tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived.
4011	4	10	22	And the standard of the camp of the Ephraimites set out according to their companies; over his company was Elishama son of Ammihud.
4012	4	10	23	Over the company of the tribe of the Manassehites was Gamaliel son of Pedahzur,
4013	4	10	24	and over the company of the tribe of Benjaminites was Abidan son of Gideoni.
4014	4	10	25	¶The standard of the camp of the Danites set out, which was the rear guard of all the camps by their companies; over his company was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
4015	4	10	26	Over the company of the tribe of the Asherites was Pagiel son of Ocran,
4016	4	10	27	and over the company of the tribe of the Naphtalites was Ahira son of Enan.
4017	4	10	28	These were the traveling arrangements of the Israelites according to their companies when they traveled.
4018	4	10	29	¶Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel, the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are journeying to the place about which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us and we will treat you well, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has promised good things for Israel.”
4019	4	10	30	But Hobab said to him, “I will not go, but I will go instead to my own land and to my kindred.”
4020	4	10	31	Moses said, “Do not leave us, because you know places for us to camp in the wilderness, and you could be our guide.
4021	4	10	32	And if you come with us, it is certain that whatever good things the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will favor us with, we will share with you as well.”
4022	4	10	33	¶So they traveled from the mountain of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> three days’ journey; and the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was traveling before them during the three days’ journey, to find a resting place for them.
4023	4	10	34	And the cloud of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was over them by day, when they traveled from the camp.
4024	4	10	35	And when the ark traveled, Moses would say, “Rise up, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! May your enemies be scattered, and may those who hate you flee before you!”
4025	4	10	36	And when it came to rest he would say, “Return, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, to the many thousands of Israel!”
4026	4	11	1	¶When the people complained, it displeased the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> heard it, his anger burned, and so the fire of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> burned among them and consumed some of the outer parts of the camp.
4027	4	11	2	When the people cried to Moses, he prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the fire died out.
4028	4	11	3	So he called the name of that place Taberah because there the fire of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> burned among them.
4029	4	11	4	¶Now the mixed multitude who were among them craved more desirable foods, and so the Israelites wept again and said, “If only we had meat to eat!
4030	4	11	5	We remember the fish we used to eat freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.
4031	4	11	6	But now we are dried up, and there is nothing at all before us except this manna!”
4032	4	11	7	(Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its color like the color of bdellium.
4033	4	11	8	And the people went about and gathered it, and ground it with mills or pounded it in mortars; they baked it in pans and made cakes of it. It tasted like fresh olive oil.
4034	4	11	9	And when the dew came down on the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.)
4035	4	11	10	¶Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, everyone at the door of his tent; and when the anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was kindled greatly, Moses was also displeased.
4036	4	11	11	And Moses said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Why have you afflicted your servant? Why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of this entire people on me?
4037	4	11	12	Did I conceive this entire people? Did I give birth to them, that you should say to me, ‘Carry them in your arms, as a foster father bears a nursing child,’ to the land which you swore to their fathers?
4038	4	11	13	From where shall I get meat to give to this entire people, for they cry to me, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat!’
4039	4	11	14	I am not able to bear this entire people alone, because it is too heavy for me!
4040	4	11	15	But if you are going to deal with me like this, then kill me immediately. If I have found favor in your sight then do not let me see my trouble.”
4041	4	11	16	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know are elders of the people and officials over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting; let them take their position there with you.
4042	4	11	17	Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take part of the Spirit that is on you, and will put it on them, and they will bear some of the burden of the people with you, so that you do not bear it all by yourself.
4043	4	11	18	¶“And say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you will eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat, for life was good for us in Egypt?” Therefore the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will give you meat, and you will eat.
4044	4	11	19	You will eat, not just one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,
4045	4	11	20	but a whole month, until it comes out your nostrils and makes you sick, because you have despised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who is among you and have wept before him, saying, “Why did we ever come out of Egypt?”’”
4046	4	11	21	¶Moses said, “The people around me are 600,000 on foot; but you say, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat for a whole month.’
4047	4	11	22	Would they have enough if the flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? If all the fish of the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?”
4048	4	11	23	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s hand shortened? Now you will see whether my word to you will come true or not!”
4049	4	11	24	¶So Moses went out and told the people the words of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He then gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tabernacle.
4050	4	11	25	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came down in the cloud and spoke to them, and he took some of the Spirit that was on Moses and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but did not do so again.
4051	4	11	26	¶But two men remained in the camp; one’s name was Eldad, and the other’s name was Medad. And the Spirit rested on them. (Now they were among those in the registration, but had not gone to the tabernacle.) So they prophesied in the camp.
4052	4	11	27	And a young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”
4053	4	11	28	Joshua son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his choice young men, said, “My lord Moses, stop them!”
4054	4	11	29	Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for me? I wish that all the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s people were prophets, that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> would put his Spirit on them!”
4055	4	11	30	Then Moses returned to the camp along with the elders of Israel.
4056	4	11	31	¶Now a wind went out from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and brought quail from the sea, and let them fall near the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and about a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about three feet high on the surface of the ground.
4057	4	11	32	And the people stayed up all that day, all that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail. The one who gathered the least gathered ten homers, and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
4058	4	11	33	But while the meat was still between their teeth, before they chewed it, the anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> burned against the people, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> struck the people with a very great plague.
4059	4	11	34	¶So the name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people that craved different food.
4060	4	11	35	The people traveled from Kibroth Hattaavah to Hazeroth, and they stayed at Hazeroth.
4061	4	12	1	¶Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman he had married (for he had married an Ethiopian woman).
4062	4	12	2	They said, “Has the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoken only through Moses? Has he not also spoken through us?” And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> heard it.
4063	4	12	3	¶(Now the man Moses was very humble, more so than any man on the face of the earth.)
4064	4	12	4	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke immediately to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam: “The three of you come to the tent of meeting.” So the three of them went.
4065	4	12	5	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent; he then called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward.
4066	4	12	6	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Hear now my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will make myself known to him in a vision; I will speak with him in a dream.
4067	4	12	7	My servant Moses is not like this; he is faithful in all my house.
4068	4	12	8	With him I will speak face to face, openly, and not in riddles; and he will see the form of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?”
4069	4	12	9	The anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> burned against them, and he departed.
4070	4	12	10	After the cloud had departed from above the tent, there was Miriam, leprous like snow. Then Aaron turned toward Miriam, and realized that she was leprous!
4071	4	12	11	¶So Aaron said to Moses, “O my lord, please do not hold this sin against us, in which we have acted foolishly and have sinned!
4072	4	12	12	Do not let her be like a baby born dead, whose flesh is half-consumed when it comes out of its mother’s womb!”
4073	4	12	13	¶Then Moses cried to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Heal her now, O God.”
4074	4	12	14	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “If her father had only spit in her face, would she not have been disgraced for seven days? Shut her out from the camp seven days, and afterward she can be brought back in again.”
4075	4	12	15	¶So Miriam was shut outside of the camp for seven days, and the people did not journey on until Miriam was brought back in.
4076	4	12	16	After that the people moved from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
4077	4	13	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4078	4	13	2	“Send out men to investigate the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. You are to send one man from each ancestral tribe, each one a leader among them.”
4079	4	13	3	So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the command of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.
4080	4	13	4	¶Now these were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur;
4081	4	13	5	from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;
4082	4	13	6	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
4083	4	13	7	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;
4084	4	13	8	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;
4085	4	13	9	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;
4086	4	13	10	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;
4087	4	13	11	from the tribe of Joseph, namely, the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi son of Susi;
4088	4	13	12	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;
4089	4	13	13	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;
4090	4	13	14	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vopshi;
4091	4	13	15	from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.
4092	4	13	16	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to investigate the land. And Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.
4093	4	13	17	¶When Moses sent them to investigate the land of Canaan, he told them, “Go up through the Negev, and then go up into the hill country
4094	4	13	18	and see what the land is like, and whether the people who live in it are strong or weak, few or many,
4095	4	13	19	and whether the land they live in is good or bad, and whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or fortified cities,
4096	4	13	20	and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether or not there are forests in it. And be brave, and bring back some of the fruit of the land.” Now it was the time of year for the first ripe grapes.
4097	4	13	21	¶So they went up and investigated the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, at Lebo Hamath.
4098	4	13	22	When they went up through the Negev, they came to Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, descendants of Anak, were living. (Now Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
4099	4	13	23	When they came to the valley of Eshcol, they cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a staff between two men, as well as some of the pomegranates and the figs.
4100	4	13	24	That place was called the Eshcol Valley, because of the cluster of grapes that the Israelites cut from there.
4101	4	13	25	They returned from investigating the land after forty days.
4102	4	13	26	¶They came back to Moses and Aaron and to the whole community of the Israelites in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh. They reported to the whole community and showed the fruit of the land.
4103	4	13	27	They told Moses, “We went to the land where you sent us. It is indeed flowing with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
4104	4	13	28	But the inhabitants are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover we saw the descendants of Anak there.
4105	4	13	29	The Amalekites live in the land of the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the banks of the Jordan.”
4106	4	13	30	¶Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses, saying, “Let us go up and occupy it, for we are well able to conquer it.”
4107	4	13	31	But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against these people, because they are stronger than we are!”
4108	4	13	32	Then they presented the Israelites with a discouraging report of the land they had investigated, saying, “The land that we passed through to investigate is a land that devours its inhabitants. All the people we saw there are of great stature.
4109	4	13	33	We even saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak came from the Nephilim), and we seemed like grasshoppers both to ourselves and to them.”
4110	4	14	1	¶Then all the community raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night.
4111	4	14	2	And all the Israelites murmured against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had perished in this wilderness!
4112	4	14	3	Why has the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought us into this land only to be killed by the sword, that our wives and our children should become plunder? Wouldn’t it be better for us to return to Egypt?”
4113	4	14	4	So they said to one another, “Let’s appoint a leader and return to Egypt.”
4114	4	14	5	¶Then Moses and Aaron fell down with their faces to the ground before the whole assembled community of the Israelites.
4115	4	14	6	And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, two of those who had investigated the land, tore their garments.
4116	4	14	7	They said to the whole community of the Israelites, “The land we passed through to investigate is an exceedingly good land.
4117	4	14	8	If the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> delights in us, then he will bring us into this land and give it to us – a land that is flowing with milk and honey.
4118	4	14	9	Only do not rebel against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and do not fear the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their protection has turned aside from them, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with us. Do not fear them!”
4119	4	14	10	¶However, the whole community threatened to stone them. But the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to all the Israelites at the tent of meeting.
4120	4	14	11	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me, and how long will they not believe in me, in spite of the signs that I have done among them?
4121	4	14	12	I will strike them with the pestilence, and I will disinherit them; I will make you into a nation that is greater and mightier than they!”
4122	4	14	13	¶Moses said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “When the Egyptians hear it – for you brought up this people by your power from among them –
4123	4	14	14	then they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, are among this people, that you, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> are seen face to face, that your cloud stands over them, and that you go before them by day in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of fire by night.
4124	4	14	15	If you kill this entire people at once, then the nations that have heard of your fame will say,
4125	4	14	16	‘Because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was not able to bring this people into the land that he swore to them, he killed them in the wilderness.’
4126	4	14	17	So now, let the power of my Lord be great, just as you have said,
4127	4	14	18	‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is slow to anger and abounding in loyal love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children until the third and fourth generations.’
4128	4	14	19	Please forgive the iniquity of this people according to your great loyal love, just as you have forgiven this people from Egypt even until now.”
4129	4	14	20	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “I have forgiven them as you asked.
4130	4	14	21	But truly, as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4131	4	14	22	For all the people have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have tempted me now these ten times, and have not obeyed me,
4132	4	14	23	they will by no means see the land that I swore to their fathers, nor will any of them who despised me see it.
4133	4	14	24	Only my servant Caleb, because he had a different spirit and has followed me fully – I will bring him into the land where he had gone, and his descendants will possess it.
4134	4	14	25	(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites were living in the valleys.) Tomorrow, turn and journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.”
4135	4	14	26	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron:
4136	4	14	27	“How long must I bear with this evil congregation that murmurs against me? I have heard the complaints of the Israelites that they murmured against me.
4137	4	14	28	Say to them, ‘As I live, says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I will surely do to you just what you have spoken in my hearing.
4138	4	14	29	Your dead bodies will fall in this wilderness – all those of you who were numbered, according to your full number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me.
4139	4	14	30	You will by no means enter into the land where I swore to settle you. The only exceptions are Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
4140	4	14	31	But I will bring in your little ones, whom you said would become victims of war, and they will enjoy the land that you have despised.
4141	4	14	32	But as for you, your dead bodies will fall in this wilderness,
4142	4	14	33	and your children will wander in the wilderness forty years and suffer for your unfaithfulness, until your dead bodies lie finished in the wilderness.
4143	4	14	34	According to the number of the days you have investigated this land, forty days – one day for a year – you will suffer for your iniquities, forty years, and you will know what it means to thwart me.
4144	4	14	35	I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have said, “I will surely do so to all this evil congregation that has gathered together against me. In this wilderness they will be finished, and there they will die!”’”
4145	4	14	36	¶The men whom Moses sent to investigate the land, who returned and made the whole community murmur against him by producing an evil report about the land,
4146	4	14	37	those men who produced the evil report about the land, died by the plague before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4147	4	14	38	But Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among the men who went to investigate the land, lived.
4148	4	14	39	When Moses told these things to all the Israelites, the people mourned greatly.
4149	4	14	40	¶And early in the morning they went up to the crest of the hill country, saying, “Here we are, and we will go up to the place that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded, for we have sinned.”
4150	4	14	41	But Moses said, “Why are you now transgressing the commandment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>? It will not succeed!
4151	4	14	42	Do not go up, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is not among you, and you will be defeated before your enemies.
4152	4	14	43	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you will fall by the sword. Because you have turned away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will not be with you.”
4153	4	14	44	¶But they dared to go up to the crest of the hill, although neither the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> nor Moses departed from the camp.
4154	4	14	45	So the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country swooped down and attacked them as far as Hormah.
4155	4	15	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4156	4	15	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you enter the land where you are to live, which I am giving you,
4157	4	15	3	and you make an offering by fire to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from the herd or from the flock (whether a burnt offering or a sacrifice for discharging a vow or as a freewill offering or in your solemn feasts) to create a pleasing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
4158	4	15	4	then the one who presents his offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> must bring a grain offering of one-tenth of an ephah of finely ground flour mixed with one fourth of a hin of olive oil.
4159	4	15	5	You must also prepare one-fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering with the burnt offering or the sacrifice for each lamb.
4160	4	15	6	Or for a ram, you must prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of finely ground flour mixed with one-third of a hin of olive oil,
4161	4	15	7	and for a drink offering you must offer one-third of a hin of wine as a pleasing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4162	4	15	8	And when you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or a sacrifice for discharging a vow or as a peace offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
4163	4	15	9	then a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of finely ground flour mixed with half a hin of olive oil must be presented with the young bull,
4164	4	15	10	and you must present as the drink offering half a hin of wine with the fire offering as a pleasing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4165	4	15	11	This is what is to be done for each ox, or each ram, or each of the male lambs or the goats.
4166	4	15	12	You must do so for each one according to the number that you prepare.
4167	4	15	13	¶“‘Every native-born person must do these things in this way to present an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4168	4	15	14	If a resident foreigner is living with you – or whoever is among you in future generations – and prepares an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he must do it the same way you are to do it.
4169	4	15	15	One statute must apply to you who belong to the congregation and to the resident foreigner who is living among you, as a permanent statute for your future generations. You and the resident foreigner will be alike before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4170	4	15	16	One law and one custom must apply to you and to the resident foreigner who lives alongside you.’”
4171	4	15	17	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4172	4	15	18	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you enter the land to which I am bringing you
4173	4	15	19	and you eat some of the food of the land, you must offer up a raised offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4174	4	15	20	You must offer up a cake of the first of your finely ground flour as a raised offering; as you offer the raised offering of the threshing floor, so you must offer it up.
4175	4	15	21	You must give to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> some of the first of your finely ground flour as a raised offering in your future generations.
4176	4	15	22	¶“‘If you sin unintentionally and do not observe all these commandments that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken to Moses –
4177	4	15	23	all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded you by the authority of Moses, from the day that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses and continuing through your future generations –
4178	4	15	24	then if anything is done unintentionally without the knowledge of the community, the whole community must prepare one young bull for a burnt offering – for a pleasing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – along with its grain offering and its customary drink offering, and one male goat for a purification offering.
4179	4	15	25	And the priest is to make atonement for the whole community of the Israelites, and they will be forgiven, because it was unintentional and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and their purification offering before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for their unintentional offense.
4180	4	15	26	And the whole community of the Israelites and the resident foreigner who lives among them will be forgiven, since all the people were involved in the unintentional offense.
4181	4	15	27	¶“‘If any person sins unintentionally, then he must bring a yearling female goat for a purification offering.
4182	4	15	28	And the priest must make atonement for the person who sins unintentionally – when he sins unintentionally before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – to make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.
4183	4	15	29	You must have one law for the person who sins unintentionally, both for the native-born among the Israelites and for the resident foreigner who lives among them.
4184	4	15	30	¶“‘But the person who acts defiantly, whether native-born or a resident foreigner, insults the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. That person must be cut off from among his people.
4185	4	15	31	Because he has despised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message and has broken his commandment, that person must be completely cut off. His iniquity will be on him.’”
4186	4	15	32	¶When the Israelites were in the wilderness they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
4187	4	15	33	Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and to the whole community.
4188	4	15	34	They put him in custody, because there was no clear instruction about what should be done to him.
4189	4	15	35	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “The man must surely be put to death; the whole community must stone him with stones outside the camp.”
4190	4	15	36	So the whole community took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses.
4191	4	15	37	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4192	4	15	38	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them to make tassels for themselves on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and put a blue thread on the tassel of the corners.
4193	4	15	39	You must have this tassel so that you may look at it and remember all the commandments of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and obey them and so that you do not follow after your own heart and your own eyes that lead you to unfaithfulness.
4194	4	15	40	Thus you will remember and obey all my commandments and be holy to your God.
4195	4	15	41	I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.”
4196	4	16	1	¶Now Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, who were Reubenites, took men
4197	4	16	2	and rebelled against Moses, along with some of the Israelites, 250 leaders of the community, chosen from the assembly, famous men.
4198	4	16	3	And they assembled against Moses and Aaron, saying to them, “You take too much upon yourselves, seeing that the whole community is holy, every one of them, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the community of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
4199	4	16	4	¶When Moses heard it he fell down with his face to the ground.
4200	4	16	5	Then he said to Korah and to all his company, “In the morning the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will make known who are his, and who is holy. He will cause that person to approach him; the person he has chosen he will cause to approach him.
4201	4	16	6	Do this, Korah, you and all your company: Take censers,
4202	4	16	7	put fire in them, and set incense on them before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> tomorrow, and the man whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> chooses will be holy. You take too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi!”
4203	4	16	8	Moses said to Korah, “Listen now, you sons of Levi!
4204	4	16	9	Does it seem too small a thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel to bring you near to himself, to perform the service of the tabernacle of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> and to stand before the community to minister to them?
4205	4	16	10	He has brought you near and all your brothers, the sons of Levi, with you. Do you now seek the priesthood also?
4206	4	16	11	Therefore you and all your company have assembled together against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord!</span> And Aaron – what is he that you murmur against him?”
4207	4	16	12	Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come up.
4208	4	16	13	Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of the land that flows with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness? Now do you want to make yourself a prince over us?
4209	4	16	14	Moreover, you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you think you can blind these men? We will not come up.”
4210	4	16	15	¶Moses was very angry, and he said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Have no respect for their offering! I have not taken so much as one donkey from them, nor have I harmed any one of them!”
4211	4	16	16	¶Then Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company present yourselves before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – you and they, and Aaron – tomorrow.
4212	4	16	17	And each of you take his censer, put incense in it, and then each of you present his censer before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord:</span> 250 censers, along with you, and Aaron – each of you with his censer.”
4213	4	16	18	So everyone took his censer, put fire in it, and set incense on it, and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron.
4214	4	16	19	When Korah assembled the whole community against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting, then the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to the whole community.
4215	4	16	20	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron:
4216	4	16	21	“Separate yourselves from among this community, that I may consume them in an instant.”
4217	4	16	22	Then they threw themselves down with their faces to the ground and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all people, will you be angry with the whole community when only one man sins?”
4218	4	16	23	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4219	4	16	24	“Tell the community: ‘Get away from around the homes of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’”
4220	4	16	25	Then Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel went after him.
4221	4	16	26	And he said to the community, “Move away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything they have, lest you be destroyed because of all their sins.”
4222	4	16	27	So they got away from the homes of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram on every side, and Dathan and Abiram came out and stationed themselves in the entrances of their tents with their wives, their children, and their toddlers.
4223	4	16	28	Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of my own will.
4224	4	16	29	If these men die a natural death, or if they share the fate of all men, then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not sent me.
4225	4	16	30	But if the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> does something entirely new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up along with all that they have, and they go down alive to the grave, then you will know that these men have despised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
4226	4	16	31	¶When he had finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split open,
4227	4	16	32	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, along with their households, and all Korah’s men, and all their goods.
4228	4	16	33	They and all that they had went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed over them. So they perished from among the community.
4229	4	16	34	All the Israelites who were around them fled at their cry, for they said, “What if the earth swallows us too?”
4230	4	16	35	Then a fire went out from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and devoured the 250 men who offered incense.
4231	4	16	36	¶(17:1) The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4232	4	16	37	“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to pick up the censers out of the flame, for they are holy, and then scatter the coals of fire at a distance.
4233	4	16	38	As for the censers of these men who sinned at the cost of their lives, they must be made into hammered sheets for covering the altar, because they presented them before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and sanctified them. They will become a sign to the Israelites.”
4234	4	16	39	So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers presented by those who had been burned up, and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar.
4235	4	16	40	It was a memorial for the Israelites, that no outsider who is not a descendant of Aaron should approach to burn incense before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, that he might not become like Korah and his company – just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had spoken by the authority of Moses.
4236	4	16	41	But on the next day the whole community of Israelites murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s people!”
4237	4	16	42	When the community assembled against Moses and Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting – and the cloud covered it, and the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared.
4238	4	16	43	Then Moses and Aaron stood before the tent of meeting.
4239	4	16	44	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4240	4	16	45	“Get away from this community, so that I can consume them in an instant!” But they threw themselves down with their faces to the ground.
4241	4	16	46	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Take the censer, put burning coals from the altar in it, place incense on it, and go quickly into the assembly and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone out from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – the plague has begun!”
4242	4	16	47	So Aaron did as Moses commanded and ran into the middle of the assembly, where the plague was just beginning among the people. So he placed incense on the coals and made atonement for the people.
4243	4	16	48	He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped.
4244	4	16	49	Now 14,700 people died in the plague, in addition to those who died in the event with Korah.
4245	4	16	50	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stopped.
4246	4	17	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4247	4	17	2	“Speak to the Israelites, and receive from them a staff from each tribe, one from every tribal leader, twelve staffs; you must write each man’s name on his staff.
4248	4	17	3	You must write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi; for one staff is for the head of every tribe.
4249	4	17	4	You must place them in the tent of meeting before the ark of the covenant where I meet with you.
4250	4	17	5	And the staff of the man whom I choose will blossom; so I will rid myself of the complaints of the Israelites, which they murmur against you.”
4251	4	17	6	¶So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff, one for each leader, according to their tribes – twelve staffs; the staff of Aaron was among their staffs.
4252	4	17	7	Then Moses placed the staffs before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the tent of the testimony.
4253	4	17	8	¶On the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony – and the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted, and brought forth buds, and produced blossoms, and yielded almonds!
4254	4	17	9	So Moses brought out all the staffs from before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each man took his staff.
4255	4	17	10	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Bring Aaron’s staff back before the testimony to be preserved for a sign to the rebels, so that you may bring their murmurings to an end before me, that they will not die.”
4256	4	17	11	So Moses did as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded him – this is what he did.
4257	4	17	12	¶The Israelites said to Moses, “We are bound to die! We perish, we all perish!
4258	4	17	13	(17:28) Anyone who even comes close to the tabernacle of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will die! Are we all to die?”
4259	4	18	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your tribe with you must bear the iniquity of the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you must bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
4260	4	18	2	¶“Bring with you your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, so that they may join with you and minister to you while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony.
4261	4	18	3	They must be responsible to care for you and to care for the entire tabernacle. However, they must not come near the furnishings of the sanctuary and the altar, or both they and you will die.
4262	4	18	4	They must join with you, and they will be responsible for the care of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent, but no unauthorized person may approach you.
4263	4	18	5	You will be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the care of the altar, so that there will be no more wrath on the Israelites.
4264	4	18	6	I myself have chosen your brothers the Levites from among the Israelites. They are given to you as a gift from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, to perform the duties of the tent of meeting.
4265	4	18	7	But you and your sons with you are responsible for your priestly duties, for everything at the altar and within the curtain. And you must serve. I give you the priesthood as a gift for service, but the unauthorized person who approaches must be put to death.”
4266	4	18	8	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Aaron, “See, I have given you the responsibility for my raised offerings; I have given all the holy things of the Israelites to you as your priestly portion and to your sons as a perpetual ordinance.
4267	4	18	9	Of all the most holy offerings reserved from the fire this will be yours: Every offering of theirs, whether from every grain offering or from every purification offering or from every reparation offering which they bring to me, will be most holy for you and for your sons.
4268	4	18	10	You are to eat it as a most holy offering; every male may eat it. It will be holy to you.
4269	4	18	11	¶“And this is yours: the raised offering of their gift, along with all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual ordinance. Everyone who is ceremonially clean in your household may eat of it.
4270	4	18	12	¶“All the best of the olive oil and all the best of the wine and of the wheat, the first fruits of these things that they give to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I have given to you.
4271	4	18	13	And whatever first ripe fruit in their land they bring to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be yours; everyone who is ceremonially clean in your household may eat of it.
4272	4	18	14	¶“Everything devoted in Israel will be yours.
4273	4	18	15	The firstborn of every womb which they present to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, whether human or animal, will be yours. Nevertheless, the firstborn sons you must redeem, and the firstborn males of unclean animals you must redeem.
4274	4	18	16	And those that must be redeemed you are to redeem when they are a month old, according to your estimation, for five shekels of silver according to the sanctuary shekel (which is twenty gerahs).
4275	4	18	17	But you must not redeem the firstborn of a cow or a sheep or a goat; they are holy. You must splash their blood on the altar and burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a pleasing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4276	4	18	18	And their meat will be yours, just as the breast and the right hip of the raised offering is yours.
4277	4	18	19	All the raised offerings of the holy things that the Israelites offer to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I have given to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual ordinance. It is a covenant of salt forever before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for you and for your descendants with you.”
4278	4	18	20	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any portion of property among them – I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites.
4279	4	18	21	See, I have given the Levites all the tithes in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they perform – the service of the tent of meeting.
4280	4	18	22	No longer may the Israelites approach the tent of meeting, or else they will bear their sin and die.
4281	4	18	23	But the Levites must perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they must bear their iniquity. It will be a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations that among the Israelites the Levites have no inheritance.
4282	4	18	24	But I have given to the Levites for an inheritance the tithes of the Israelites that are offered to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as a raised offering. That is why I said to them that among the Israelites they are to have no inheritance.”
4283	4	18	25	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4284	4	18	26	“You are to speak to the Levites, and you must tell them, ‘When you receive from the Israelites the tithe that I have given you from them as your inheritance, then you are to offer up from it as a raised offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> a tenth of the tithe.
4285	4	18	27	And your raised offering will be credited to you as though it were grain from the threshing floor or as new wine from the winepress.
4286	4	18	28	Thus you are to offer up a raised offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of all your tithes which you receive from the Israelites; and you must give the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s raised offering from it to Aaron the priest.
4287	4	18	29	From all your gifts you must offer up every raised offering due the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, from all the best of it, and the holiest part of it.’
4288	4	18	30	¶“Therefore you will say to them, ‘When you offer up the best of it, then it will be credited to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor and as the product of the winepress.
4289	4	18	31	And you may eat it in any place, you and your household, because it is your wages for your service in the tent of meeting.
4290	4	18	32	And you will bear no sin concerning it when you offer up the best of it. And you must not profane the holy things of the Israelites, or else you will die.’”
4291	4	19	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron:
4292	4	19	2	“This is the ordinance of the law which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded: ‘Instruct the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without blemish, which has no defect and has never carried a yoke.
4293	4	19	3	You must give it to Eleazar the priest so that he can take it outside the camp, and it must be slaughtered before him.
4294	4	19	4	Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of the blood seven times directly in front of the tent of meeting.
4295	4	19	5	Then the heifer must be burned in his sight – its skin, its flesh, its blood, and its offal is to be burned.
4296	4	19	6	And the priest must take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool and throw them into the midst of the fire where the heifer is burning.
4297	4	19	7	Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and afterward he may come into the camp, but the priest will be ceremonially unclean until evening.
4298	4	19	8	The one who burns it must wash his clothes in water and bathe himself in water. He will be ceremonially unclean until evening.
4299	4	19	9	¶“‘Then a man who is ceremonially clean must gather up the ashes of the red heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They must be kept for the community of the Israelites for use in the water of purification – it is a purification for sin.
4300	4	19	10	The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer must wash his clothes and be ceremonially unclean until evening. This will be a permanent ordinance both for the Israelites and the resident foreigner who lives among them.
4301	4	19	11	¶“‘Whoever touches the corpse of any person will be ceremonially unclean seven days.
4302	4	19	12	He must purify himself with water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third day and the seventh day, then he will not be clean.
4303	4	19	13	Anyone who touches the corpse of any dead person and does not purify himself defiles the tabernacle of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. And that person must be cut off from Israel, because the water of purification was not sprinkled on him. He will be unclean; his uncleanness remains on him.
4304	4	19	14	¶“‘This is the law: When a man dies in a tent, anyone who comes into the tent and all who are in the tent will be ceremonially unclean seven days.
4305	4	19	15	And every open container that has no covering fastened on it is unclean.
4306	4	19	16	And whoever touches the body of someone killed with a sword in the open fields, or the body of someone who died of natural causes, or a human bone, or a grave, will be unclean seven days.
4307	4	19	17	¶“‘For a ceremonially unclean person you must take some of the ashes of the heifer burnt for purification from sin and pour fresh running water over them in a vessel.
4308	4	19	18	Then a ceremonially clean person must take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, on all its furnishings, and on the people who were there, or on the one who touched a bone, or one killed, or one who died, or a grave.
4309	4	19	19	And the clean person must sprinkle the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he must purify him, and then he must wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and he will be clean in the evening.
4310	4	19	20	But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person must be cut off from among the community, because he has polluted the sanctuary of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; the water of purification was not sprinkled on him, so he is unclean.
4311	4	19	21	¶“‘So this will be a perpetual ordinance for them: The one who sprinkles the water of purification must wash his clothes, and the one who touches the water of purification will be unclean until evening.
4312	4	19	22	And whatever the unclean person touches will be unclean, and the person who touches it will be unclean until evening.’”
4313	4	20	1	¶Then the entire community of Israel entered the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh. Miriam died and was buried there.
4314	4	20	2	¶And there was no water for the community, and so they gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron.
4315	4	20	3	The people contended with Moses, saying, “If only we had died when our brothers died before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!
4316	4	20	4	Why have you brought up the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s community into this wilderness? So that we and our cattle should die here?
4317	4	20	5	Why have you brought us up from Egypt only to bring us to this dreadful place? It is no place for grain, or figs, or vines, or pomegranates; nor is there any water to drink!”
4318	4	20	6	¶So Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting. They then threw themselves down with their faces to the ground, and the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to them.
4319	4	20	7	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4320	4	20	8	“Take the staff and assemble the community, you and Aaron your brother, and then speak to the rock before their eyes. It will pour forth its water, and you will bring water out of the rock for them, and so you will give the community and their beasts water to drink.”
4321	4	20	9	¶So Moses took the staff from before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, just as he commanded him.
4322	4	20	10	Then Moses and Aaron gathered the community together in front of the rock, and he said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring water out of this rock for you?”
4323	4	20	11	Then Moses raised his hand, and struck the rock twice with his staff. And water came out abundantly. So the community drank, and their beasts drank too.
4324	4	20	12	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust me enough to show me as holy before the Israelites, therefore you will not bring this community into the land I have given them.”
4325	4	20	13	¶These are the waters of Meribah, because the Israelites contended with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and his holiness was maintained among them.
4326	4	20	14	¶Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: “Thus says your brother Israel: ‘You know all the hardships we have experienced,
4327	4	20	15	how our ancestors went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our ancestors badly.
4328	4	20	16	So when we cried to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he heard our voice and sent a messenger, and has brought us up out of Egypt. Now we are here in Kadesh, a town on the edge of your country.
4329	4	20	17	Please let us pass through your country. We will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards, nor will we drink water from any well. We will go by the King’s Highway; we will not turn to the right or the left until we have passed through your region.’”
4330	4	20	18	¶But Edom said to him, “You will not pass through me, or I will come out against you with the sword.”
4331	4	20	19	Then the Israelites said to him, “We will go along the highway, and if we or our cattle drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We will only pass through on our feet, without doing anything else.”
4332	4	20	20	¶But he said, “You may not pass through.” Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful force.
4333	4	20	21	So Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border; therefore Israel turned away from him.
4334	4	20	22	¶So the entire company of Israelites traveled from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.
4335	4	20	23	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom. He said:
4336	4	20	24	“Aaron will be gathered to his ancestors, for he will not enter into the land I have given to the Israelites because both of you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.
4337	4	20	25	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up on Mount Hor.
4338	4	20	26	Remove Aaron’s priestly garments and put them on Eleazar his son, and Aaron will be gathered to his ancestors and will die there.”
4339	4	20	27	¶So Moses did as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded; and they went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.
4340	4	20	28	And Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. So Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
4341	4	20	29	When all the community saw that Aaron was dead, the whole house of Israel mourned for Aaron thirty days.
4342	4	21	1	¶When the Canaanite king of Arad who lived in the Negev heard that Israel was approaching along the road to Atharim, he fought against Israel and took some of them prisoner.
4343	4	21	2	¶So Israel made a vow to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and said, “If you will indeed deliver this people into our hand, then we will utterly destroy their cities.”
4344	4	21	3	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. So the name of the place was called Hormah.
4345	4	21	4	¶Then they traveled from Mount Hor by the road to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom, but the people became impatient along the way.
4346	4	21	5	And the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness, for there is no bread or water, and we detest this worthless food.”
4347	4	21	6	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent venomous snakes among the people, and they bit the people; many people of Israel died.
4348	4	21	7	Then the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and against you. Pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that he would take away the snakes from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.
4349	4	21	8	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Make a poisonous snake and set it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will live.”
4350	4	21	9	So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole, so that if a snake had bitten someone, when he looked at the bronze snake he lived.
4351	4	21	10	¶The Israelites traveled on and camped in Oboth.
4352	4	21	11	Then they traveled on from Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim, in the wilderness that is before Moab, on the eastern side.
4353	4	21	12	From there they moved on and camped in the valley of Zered.
4354	4	21	13	From there they moved on and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends from the regions of the Amorites, for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
4355	4	21	14	This is why it is said in the Book of the Wars of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡“Waheb in Suphah and the wadis, ‡the Arnon
4356	4	21	15	and the slope of the valleys ‡that extends to the dwelling of Ar, ‡and falls off at the border of Moab.”
4357	4	21	16	¶And from there they traveled to Beer; that is the well where the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, “Gather the people and I will give them water.”
4358	4	21	17	Then Israel sang this song: ‡“Spring up, O well, sing to it!
4359	4	21	18	‡The well which the princes dug,‡which the leaders of the people opened‡with their scepters and their staffs.”¶And from the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;
4360	4	21	19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;
4361	4	21	20	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the country of Moab, near the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the wastelands.
4362	4	21	21	¶Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites, saying,
4363	4	21	22	¶“Let us pass through your land; we will not turn aside into the fields or into the vineyards, nor will we drink water from any well, but we will go along the King’s Highway until we pass your borders.”
4364	4	21	23	But Sihon did not permit Israel to pass through his border; he gathered all his forces together and went out against Israel into the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel.
4365	4	21	24	But the Israelites defeated him in battle and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strongly defended.
4366	4	21	25	So Israel took all these cities; and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
4367	4	21	26	For Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites. Now he had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all of his land from his control, as far as the Arnon.
4368	4	21	27	That is why those who speak in proverbs say,‡“Come to Heshbon, let it be built.‡Let the city of Sihon be established!
4369	4	21	28	‡For fire went out from Heshbon, ‡a flame from the city of Sihon.‡It has consumed Ar of Moab‡and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
4370	4	21	29	‡Woe to you, Moab.‡You are ruined, O people of Chemosh! ‡He has made his sons fugitives,‡and his daughters the prisoners of King Sihon of the Amorites.
4371	4	21	30	‡We have overpowered them; ‡Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon.‡We have shattered them as far as Nophah, ‡which reaches to Medeba.”
4372	4	21	31	¶So the Israelites lived in the land of the Amorites.
4373	4	21	32	Moses sent spies to reconnoiter Jaazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.
4374	4	21	33	¶Then they turned and went up by the road to Bashan. And King Og of Bashan and all his forces marched out against them to do battle at Edrei.
4375	4	21	34	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand. You will do to him what you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.”
4376	4	21	35	So they defeated Og, his sons, and all his people, until there were no survivors, and they possessed his land.
4377	4	22	1	¶The Israelites traveled on and camped in the rift valley plains of Moab on the side of the Jordan River across from Jericho.
4378	4	22	2	Balak son of Zippor saw all that the Israelites had done to the Amorites.
4379	4	22	3	And the Moabites were greatly afraid of the people, because they were so numerous. The Moabites were sick with fear because of the Israelites.
4380	4	22	4	¶So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “Now this mass of people will lick up everything around us, as the bull devours the grass of the field.” Now Balak son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at this time.
4381	4	22	5	And he sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the Euphrates River in the land of Amaw, to summon him, saying, “Look, a nation has come out of Egypt. They cover the face of the earth, and they are settling next to me.
4382	4	22	6	So now, please come and curse this nation for me, for they are too powerful for me. Perhaps I will prevail so that we may conquer them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.”
4383	4	22	7	¶So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fee for divination in their hand. They came to Balaam and reported to him the words of Balak.
4384	4	22	8	He replied to them, “Stay here tonight, and I will bring back to you whatever word the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> may speak to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
4385	4	22	9	And God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”
4386	4	22	10	Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent a message to me, saying,
4387	4	22	11	“Look, a nation has come out of Egypt, and it covers the face of the earth. Come now and put a curse on them for me; perhaps I will be able to defeat them and drive them out.”
4388	4	22	12	But God said to Balaam, “You must not go with them; you must not curse the people, for they are blessed.”
4389	4	22	13	¶So Balaam got up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has refused to permit me to go with you.”
4390	4	22	14	So the princes of Moab departed and went back to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
4391	4	22	15	¶Balak again sent princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first.
4392	4	22	16	And they came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak son of Zippor: ‘Please do not let anything hinder you from coming to me.
4393	4	22	17	For I will honor you greatly, and whatever you tell me I will do. So come, put a curse on this nation for me.’”
4394	4	22	18	¶Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “Even if Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold, I could not transgress the commandment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God to do less or more.
4395	4	22	19	Now therefore, please stay the night here also, that I may know what more the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> might say to me.”
4396	4	22	20	God came to Balaam that night, and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, get up and go with them, but the word that I will say to you, that you must do.”
4397	4	22	21	So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.
4398	4	22	22	¶Then God’s anger was kindled because he went, and the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> stood in the road to oppose him. Now he was riding on his donkey and his two servants were with him.
4399	4	22	23	And the donkey saw the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, so the donkey turned aside from the road and went into the field. But Balaam beat the donkey, to make her turn back to the road.
4400	4	22	24	¶Then the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> stood in a path among the vineyards, where there was a wall on either side.
4401	4	22	25	And when the donkey saw the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, she pressed herself into the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So he beat her again.
4402	4	22	26	¶Then the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> went farther, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.
4403	4	22	27	When the donkey saw the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, she crouched down under Balaam. Then Balaam was angry, and he beat his donkey with a staff.
4404	4	22	28	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?”
4405	4	22	29	And Balaam said to the donkey, “You have made me look stupid; I wish there were a sword in my hand, for I would kill you right now.”
4406	4	22	30	The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey that you have ridden ever since I was yours until this day? Have I ever attempted to treat you this way?” And he said, “No.”
4407	4	22	31	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand; so he bowed his head and threw himself down with his face to the ground.
4408	4	22	32	The angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Look, I came out to oppose you because what you are doing is perverse before me.
4409	4	22	33	The donkey saw me and turned from me these three times. If she had not turned from me, I would have killed you but saved her alive.”
4410	4	22	34	Balaam said to the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood against me in the road. So now, if it is evil in your sight, I will go back home.”
4411	4	22	35	But the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you may only speak the word that I will speak to you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
4412	4	22	36	¶When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at a city of Moab which was on the border of the Arnon at the boundary of his territory.
4413	4	22	37	Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send again and again to you to summon you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?”
4414	4	22	38	Balaam said to Balak, “Look, I have come to you. Now, am I able to speak just anything? I must speak only the word that God puts in my mouth.”
4415	4	22	39	So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
4416	4	22	40	And Balak sacrificed bulls and sheep, and sent some to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him.
4417	4	22	41	Then on the next morning Balak took Balaam, and brought him up to Bamoth Baal. From there he saw the extent of the nation.
4418	4	23	1	¶Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”
4419	4	23	2	So Balak did just as Balaam had said. Balak and Balaam then offered on each altar a bull and a ram.
4420	4	23	3	Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself by your burnt offering, and I will go off; perhaps the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will come to meet me, and whatever he reveals to me I will tell you.” Then he went to a deserted height.
4421	4	23	4	¶Then God met Balaam, who said to him, “I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.”
4422	4	23	5	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> put a message in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and speak what I tell you.”
4423	4	23	6	¶So he returned to him, and he was still standing by his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab.
4424	4	23	7	Then Balaam uttered his oracle, saying, ‡“Balak, the king of Moab, brought me from Aram, ‡out of the mountains of the east, saying, ‡‘Come, pronounce a curse on Jacob for me; ‡come, denounce Israel.’
4425	4	23	8	‡How can I curse one whom God has not cursed, ‡or how can I denounce one whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not denounced?
4426	4	23	9	‡For from the top of the rocks I see them; ‡from the hills I watch them. ‡Indeed, a nation that lives alone, ‡and it will not be reckoned among the nations.
4427	4	23	10	‡Who can count the dust of Jacob, ‡or number the fourth part of Israel? ‡Let me die the death of the upright, ‡and let the end of my life be like theirs.”
4428	4	23	11	¶Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but on the contrary you have only blessed them!”
4429	4	23	12	Balaam replied, “Must I not be careful to speak what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has put in my mouth?”
4430	4	23	13	Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from which you can observe them. You will see only a part of them, but you will not see all of them. Curse them for me from there.”
4431	4	23	14	¶So Balak brought Balaam to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, where he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
4432	4	23	15	And Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself here by your burnt offering, while I meet the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> there.”
4433	4	23	16	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> met Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and speak what I tell you.”
4434	4	23	17	When Balaam came to him, he was still standing by his burnt offering, along with the princes of Moab. And Balak said to him, “What has the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoken?”
4435	4	23	18	¶Balaam uttered his oracle, and said,‡“Rise up, Balak, and hear;‡Listen to me, son of Zippor:
4436	4	23	19	‡God is not a man, that he should lie,‡nor a human being, that he should change his mind.‡Has he said, and will he not do it?‡Or has he spoken, and will he not make it happen?
4437	4	23	20	‡Indeed, I have received a command to bless;‡he has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
4438	4	23	21	‡He has not looked on iniquity in Jacob, ‡nor has he seen trouble in Israel.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God is with them;‡his acclamation as king is among them.
4439	4	23	22	‡God brought them out of Egypt.‡They have, as it were, the strength of a wild bull.
4440	4	23	23	‡For there is no spell against Jacob,‡nor is there any divination against Israel.‡At this time it must be said of Jacob‡and of Israel, ‘Look at what God has done!’
4441	4	23	24	‡Indeed, the people will rise up like a lioness,‡and like a lion raises himself up;‡they will not lie down until they eat their prey,‡and drink the blood of the slain.”
4442	4	23	25	¶Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!”
4443	4	23	26	But Balaam replied to Balak, “Did I not tell you, ‘All that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> speaks, I must do’?”
4444	4	23	27	¶Balak said to Balaam, “Come, please; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.”
4445	4	23	28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks toward the wastelands.
4446	4	23	29	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars here for me, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams.”
4447	4	23	30	So Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
4448	4	24	1	¶When Balaam saw that it pleased the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to bless Israel, he did not go as at the other times to seek for omens, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
4449	4	24	2	When Balaam lifted up his eyes, he saw Israel camped tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
4450	4	24	3	Then he uttered this oracle: ‡“The oracle of Balaam son of Beor;‡the oracle of the man whose eyes are open;
4451	4	24	4	‡the oracle of the one who hears the words of God,‡who sees a vision from the Almighty,‡although falling flat on the ground with eyes open:
4452	4	24	5	‡‘How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob,‡and your dwelling places, O Israel!
4453	4	24	6	‡They are like valleys stretched forth,‡like gardens by the river’s side,‡like aloes that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has planted,‡and like cedar trees beside the waters.
4454	4	24	7	‡He will pour the water out of his buckets, ‡and their descendants will be like abundant water; ‡their king will be greater than Agag, ‡and their kingdom will be exalted.
4455	4	24	8	‡God brought them out of Egypt.‡They have, as it were, the strength of a young bull;‡they will devour hostile people ‡and will break their bones‡and will pierce them through with arrows.
4456	4	24	9	‡They crouch and lie down like a lion,‡and as a lioness, who can stir him?‡Blessed is the one who blesses you,‡and cursed is the one who curses you!’”
4457	4	24	10	¶Then Balak became very angry at Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and look, you have done nothing but bless them these three times!
4458	4	24	11	So now, go back where you came from! I said that I would greatly honor you, but now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has stood in the way of your honor.”
4459	4	24	12	¶Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not also tell your messengers whom you sent to me,
4460	4	24	13	‘If Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to do either good or evil of my own will, but whatever the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> tells me I must speak’?
4461	4	24	14	And now, I am about to go back to my own people. Come now, and I will advise you as to what this people will do to your people in the future.”
4462	4	24	15	¶Then he uttered this oracle: ‡“The oracle of Balaam son of Beor;‡the oracle of the man whose eyes are open;
4463	4	24	16	‡the oracle of the one who hears the words of God,‡and who knows the knowledge of the Most High,‡who sees a vision from the Almighty,‡although falling flat on the ground with eyes open:
4464	4	24	17	‡‘I see him, but not now;‡I behold him, but not close at hand. ‡A star will march forth out of Jacob,‡and a scepter will rise out of Israel.‡He will crush the skulls of Moab,‡and the heads of all the sons of Sheth.
4465	4	24	18	‡Edom will be a possession,‡Seir, his enemies, will also be a possession;‡but Israel will act valiantly.
4466	4	24	19	‡A ruler will be established from Jacob;‡he will destroy the remains of the city.’”
4467	4	24	20	¶Then Balaam looked on Amalek and delivered this oracle: ‡“Amalek was the first of the nations,‡but his end will be that he will perish.”
4468	4	24	21	¶Then he looked on the Kenites and uttered this oracle:‡“Your dwelling place seems strong, ‡and your nest is set on a rocky cliff.
4469	4	24	22	‡Nevertheless the Kenite will be consumed. ‡How long will Asshur take you away captive?”
4470	4	24	23	¶Then he uttered this oracle:‡“O, who will survive when God does this!
4471	4	24	24	‡Ships will come from the coast of Kittim, ‡and will afflict Asshur, and will afflict Eber,‡and he will also perish forever.”
4472	4	24	25	¶Balaam got up and departed and returned to his home, and Balak also went his way.
4473	4	25	1	¶When Israel lived in Shittim, the people began to commit sexual immorality with the daughters of Moab.
4474	4	25	2	These women invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods; then the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
4475	4	25	3	When Israel joined themselves to Baal-peor, the anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> flared up against Israel.
4476	4	25	4	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Arrest all the leaders of the people, and hang them up before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in broad daylight, so that the fierce anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> may be turned away from Israel.”
4477	4	25	5	So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you must execute those of his men who were joined to Baal-peor.”
4478	4	25	6	¶Just then one of the Israelites came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the plain view of Moses and of the whole community of the Israelites, while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
4479	4	25	7	When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he got up from among the assembly, took a javelin in his hand,
4480	4	25	8	and went after the Israelite man into the tent and thrust through the Israelite man and into the woman’s abdomen. So the plague was stopped from the Israelites.
4481	4	25	9	Those that died in the plague were 24,000.
4482	4	25	10	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4483	4	25	11	“Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites, when he manifested such zeal for my sake among them, so that I did not consume the Israelites in my zeal.
4484	4	25	12	Therefore, announce: ‘I am going to give to him my covenant of peace.
4485	4	25	13	So it will be to him and his descendants after him a covenant of a permanent priesthood, because he has been zealous for his God, and has made atonement for the Israelites.’”
4486	4	25	14	¶Now the name of the Israelite who was stabbed – the one who was stabbed with the Midianite woman – was Zimri son of Salu, a leader of a clan of the Simeonites.
4487	4	25	15	The name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi daughter of Zur. He was a leader over the people of a clan of Midian.
4488	4	25	16	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4489	4	25	17	“Bring trouble to the Midianites, and destroy them,
4490	4	25	18	because they bring trouble to you by their treachery with which they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who was killed on the day of the plague that happened as a result of Peor.”
4491	4	26	1	¶After the plague the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses and to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest,
4492	4	26	2	“Take a census of the whole community of Israelites, from twenty years old and upward, by their clans, everyone who can serve in the army of Israel.”
4493	4	26	3	So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the rift valley plains of Moab, along the Jordan River across from Jericho. They said,
4494	4	26	4	“Number the people from twenty years old and upward, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses and the Israelites who went out from the land of Egypt.”
4495	4	26	5	¶Reuben was the firstborn of Israel. The Reubenites: from Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; from Pallu, the family of the Palluites;
4496	4	26	6	from Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; from Carmi, the family of the Carmites.
4497	4	26	7	These were the families of the Reubenites; and those numbered of them were 43,730.
4498	4	26	8	Pallu’s descendant was Eliab.
4499	4	26	9	Eliab’s descendants were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. It was Dathan and Abiram who as leaders of the community rebelled against Moses and Aaron with the followers of Korah when they rebelled against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4500	4	26	10	The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and Korah at the time that company died, when the fire consumed 250 men. So they became a warning.
4501	4	26	11	But the descendants of Korah did not die.
4502	4	26	12	¶The Simeonites by their families: from Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites; from Jamin, the family of the Jaminites; from Jakin, the family of the Jakinites;
4503	4	26	13	from Zerah, the family of the Zerahites; and from Shaul, the family of the Shaulites.

4508	4	26	18	These were the families of the Gadites according to those numbered of them, 40,500.
4509	4	26	19	¶The descendants of Judah were Er and Onan, but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.
4510	4	26	20	And the Judahites by their families were: from Shelah, the family of the Shelahites; from Perez, the family of the Perezites; and from Zerah, the family of the Zerahites.

4517	4	26	27	These were the families of the Zebulunites, according to those numbered of them, 60,500.
4518	4	26	28	¶The descendants of Joseph by their families: Manasseh and Ephraim.
4519	4	26	29	The Manassehites: from Machir, the family of the Machirites (now Machir became the father of Gilead); from Gilead, the family of the Gileadites.
4520	4	26	30	These were the Gileadites: from Iezer, the family of the Iezerites; from Helek, the family of the Helekites;
4521	4	26	31	from Asriel, the family of the Asrielites; from Shechem, the family of the Shechemites;
4522	4	26	32	from Shemida, the family of the Shemidaites; from Hepher, the family of the Hepherites.
4523	4	26	33	Now Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons, but only daughters; and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
4524	4	26	34	These were the families of Manasseh; those numbered of them were 52,700.

4536	4	26	46	Now the name of the daughter of Asher was Serah.
4537	4	26	47	These are the families of the Asherites, according to those numbered of them, 53,400.
4538	4	26	48	¶The Naphtalites by their families: from Jahzeel, the family of the Jahzeelites; from Guni, the family of the Gunites;
4539	4	26	49	from Jezer, the family of the Jezerites; from Shillem, the family of the Shillemites.
4540	4	26	50	These were the families of Naphtali according to their families; and those numbered of them were 45,400.
4541	4	26	51	¶These were those numbered of the Israelites, 601,730.
4542	4	26	52	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4543	4	26	53	“To these the land must be divided as an inheritance according to the number of the names.
4544	4	26	54	To a larger group you will give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group you will give a smaller inheritance. To each one its inheritance must be given according to the number of people in it.
4545	4	26	55	The land must be divided by lot; and they will inherit in accordance with the names of their ancestral tribes.
4546	4	26	56	Their inheritance must be apportioned by lot among the larger and smaller groups.”
4547	4	26	57	¶And these are the Levites who were numbered according to their families: from Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; from Merari, the family of the Merarites.
4548	4	26	58	These are the families of the Levites: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korahites. Kohath became the father of Amram.
4549	4	26	59	Now the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt. And to Amram she bore Aaron, Moses, and Miriam their sister.
4550	4	26	60	And to Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
4551	4	26	61	But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4552	4	26	62	Those of them who were numbered were 23,000, all males from a month old and upward, for they were not numbered among the Israelites; no inheritance was given to them among the Israelites.
4553	4	26	63	¶These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the Israelites in the rift valley plains of Moab along the Jordan River opposite Jericho.
4554	4	26	64	But there was not a man among these who had been among those numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they numbered the Israelites in the desert of Sinai.
4555	4	26	65	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had said of them, “They will surely die in the wilderness.” And there was not left a single man of them, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
4556	4	27	1	¶Then the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh of the families of Manasseh, the son of Joseph came forward. Now these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
4557	4	27	2	And they stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest and the leaders of the whole assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said,
4558	4	27	3	“Our father died in the wilderness, although he was not part of the company of those that gathered themselves together against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the company of Korah, but he died for his own sin, and he had no sons.
4559	4	27	4	Why should the name of our father be lost from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among the relatives of our father.”
4560	4	27	5	¶So Moses brought their case before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4561	4	27	6	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses:
4562	4	27	7	“The daughters of Zelophehad have a valid claim. You must indeed give them possession of an inheritance among their father’s relatives, and you must transfer the inheritance of their father to them.
4563	4	27	8	And you must tell the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and has no son, then you must transfer his inheritance to his daughter;
4564	4	27	9	and if he has no daughter, then you are to give his inheritance to his brothers;
4565	4	27	10	and if he has no brothers, then you are to give his inheritance to his father’s brothers;
4566	4	27	11	and if his father has no brothers, then you are to give his inheritance to his relative nearest to him from his family, and he will possess it. This will be for the Israelites a legal requirement, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses.’”
4567	4	27	12	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go up this mountain of the Abarim range, and see the land I have given to the Israelites.
4568	4	27	13	When you have seen it, you will be gathered to your ancestors, as Aaron your brother was gathered to his ancestors.
4569	4	27	14	For in the wilderness of Zin when the community rebelled against me, you rebelled against my command to show me as holy before their eyes over the water – the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.”
4570	4	27	15	¶Then Moses spoke to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord:</span>
4571	4	27	16	“Let the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of the spirits of all humankind, appoint a man over the community,
4572	4	27	17	who will go out before them, and who will come in before them, and who will lead them out, and who will bring them in, so that the community of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> may not be like sheep that have no shepherd.”
4573	4	27	18	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> replied to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him;
4574	4	27	19	set him before Eleazar the priest and before the whole community, and commission him publicly.
4575	4	27	20	Then you must delegate some of your authority to him, so that the whole community of the Israelites will be obedient.
4576	4	27	21	And he will stand before Eleazar the priest, who will seek counsel for him before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by the decision of the Urim. At his command they will go out, and at his command they will come in, he and all the Israelites with him, the whole community.”
4577	4	27	22	¶So Moses did as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded him; he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before the whole community.
4578	4	27	23	He laid his hands on him and commissioned him, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded, by the authority of Moses.
4579	4	28	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4580	4	28	2	“Command the Israelites: ‘With regard to my offering, be sure to offer my food for my offering made by fire, as a pleasing aroma to me at its appointed time.’
4581	4	28	3	You will say to them, ‘This is the offering made by fire which you must offer to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: two unblemished lambs one year old each day for a continual burnt offering.
4582	4	28	4	The first lamb you must offer in the morning, and the second lamb you must offer in the late afternoon,
4583	4	28	5	with one-tenth of an ephah of finely ground flour as a grain offering mixed with one quarter of a hin of pressed olive oil.
4584	4	28	6	It is a continual burnt offering that was instituted on Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4585	4	28	7	¶“‘And its drink offering must be one quarter of a hin for each lamb. You must pour out the strong drink as a drink offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the holy place.
4586	4	28	8	And the second lamb you must offer in the late afternoon; just as you offered the grain offering and drink offering in the morning, you must offer it as an offering made by fire, as a pleasing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4587	4	28	9	¶“‘On the Sabbath day, you must offer two unblemished lambs a year old, and two-tenths of an ephah of finely ground flour as a grain offering, mixed with olive oil, along with its drink offering.
4588	4	28	10	This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
4589	4	28	11	¶“‘On the first day of each month you must offer as a burnt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> two young bulls, one ram, and seven unblemished lambs a year old,
4590	4	28	12	with three-tenths of an ephah of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering for each bull, and two-tenths of an ephah of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering for the ram,
4591	4	28	13	and one-tenth of an ephah of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering for each lamb, as a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4592	4	28	14	For their drink offerings, include half a hin of wine with each bull, one-third of a hin for the ram, and one-fourth of a hin for each lamb. This is the burnt offering for each month throughout the months of the year.
4593	4	28	15	And one male goat must be offered to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as a purification offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
4594	4	28	16	¶“‘On the fourteenth day of the first month is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Passover.
4595	4	28	17	And on the fifteenth day of this month is the festival. For seven days bread made without yeast must be eaten.
4596	4	28	18	And on the first day there is to be a holy assembly; you must do no ordinary work on it.
4597	4	28	19	¶“‘But you must offer to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> an offering made by fire, a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs one year old; they must all be unblemished.
4598	4	28	20	And their grain offering is to be of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil. For each bull you must offer three-tenths of an ephah, and two-tenths for the ram.
4599	4	28	21	For each of the seven lambs you are to offer one-tenth of an ephah,
4600	4	28	22	as well as one goat for a purification offering, to make atonement for you.
4601	4	28	23	You must offer these in addition to the burnt offering in the morning which is for a continual burnt offering.
4602	4	28	24	In this manner you must offer daily throughout the seven days the food of the sacrifice made by fire as a sweet aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. It is to be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
4603	4	28	25	On the seventh day you are to have a holy assembly, you must do no regular work.
4604	4	28	26	¶“‘Also, on the day of the first fruits, when you bring a new grain offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> during your Feast of Weeks, you are to have a holy assembly. You must do no ordinary work.
4605	4	28	27	But you must offer as the burnt offering, as a sweet aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> two young bulls, one ram, seven lambs one year old,
4606	4	28	28	with their grain offering of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram,
4607	4	28	29	with one-tenth for each of the seven lambs,
4608	4	28	30	as well as one male goat to make an atonement for you.
4609	4	28	31	You are to offer them with their drink offerings in addition to the continual burnt offering and its grain offering – they must be unblemished.
4610	4	29	1	¶“‘On the first day of the seventh month, you are to hold a holy assembly. You must not do your ordinary work, for it is a day of blowing trumpets for you.
4611	4	29	2	You must offer a burnt offering as a sweet aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: one young bull, one ram, and seven lambs one year old without blemish.
4612	4	29	3	¶“‘Their grain offering is to be of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil, three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths of an ephah for the ram,

4614	4	29	5	with one male goat for a purification offering to make an atonement for you;
4615	4	29	6	this is in addition to the monthly burnt offering and its grain offering, and the daily burnt offering with its grain offering and their drink offerings as prescribed, as a sweet aroma, a sacrifice made by fire to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
4616	4	29	7	¶“‘On the tenth day of this seventh month you are to have a holy assembly. You must humble yourselves; you must not do any work on it.
4617	4	29	8	But you must offer a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, one young bull, one ram, and seven lambs one year old, all of them without blemish.
4618	4	29	9	Their grain offering must be of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil, three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the ram,

4620	4	29	11	along with one male goat for a purification offering, in addition to the purification offering for atonement and the continual burnt offering with its grain offering and their drink offerings.
4621	4	29	12	¶“‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you are to have a holy assembly; you must do no ordinary work, and you must keep a festival to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for seven days.
4622	4	29	13	You must offer a burnt offering, an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: thirteen young bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs each one year old, all of them without blemish.
4623	4	29	14	Their grain offering must be of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil, three-tenths of an ephah for each of the thirteen bulls, two-tenths of an ephah for each of the two rams,

4644	4	29	35	¶“‘On the eighth day you are to have a holy assembly; you must do no ordinary work on it.

4649	4	29	40	(30:1) So Moses told the Israelites everything, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded him.
4650	4	30	1	¶Moses told the leaders of the tribes concerning the Israelites, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded:
4651	4	30	2	If a man makes a vow to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> or takes an oath of binding obligation on himself, he must not break his word, but must do whatever he has promised.
4652	4	30	3	¶“If a young woman who is still living in her father’s house makes a vow to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> or places herself under an obligation,
4653	4	30	4	and her father hears of her vow or the obligation to which she has pledged herself, and her father remains silent about her, then all her vows will stand, and every obligation to which she has pledged herself will stand.
4654	4	30	5	But if her father overrules her when he hears about it, then none of her vows or her obligations which she has pledged for herself will stand. And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will release her from it, because her father overruled her.
4655	4	30	6	¶“And if she marries a husband while under a vow, or she uttered anything impulsively by which she has pledged herself,
4656	4	30	7	and her husband hears about it, but remains silent about her when he hears about it, then her vows will stand and her obligations which she has pledged for herself will stand.
4657	4	30	8	But if when her husband hears it he overrules her, then he will nullify the vow she has taken, and whatever she uttered impulsively which she has pledged for herself. And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will release her from it.
4658	4	30	9	¶“But every vow of a widow or of a divorced woman which she has pledged for herself will remain intact.
4659	4	30	10	If she made the vow in her husband’s house or put herself under obligation with an oath,
4660	4	30	11	and her husband heard about it, but remained silent about her, and did not overrule her, then all her vows will stand, and every obligation which she pledged for herself will stand.
4661	4	30	12	But if her husband clearly nullifies them when he hears them, then whatever she says by way of vows or obligations will not stand. Her husband has made them void, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will release her from them.
4662	4	30	13	¶“Any vow or sworn obligation that would bring affliction to her, her husband can confirm or nullify.
4663	4	30	14	But if her husband remains completely silent about her from day to day, he thus confirms all her vows or all her obligations which she is under; he confirms them because he remained silent about her when he heard them.
4664	4	30	15	But if he should nullify them after he has heard them, then he will bear her iniquity.”
4665	4	30	16	¶These are the statutes that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses, relating to a man and his wife, and a father and his young daughter who is still living in her father’s house.
4666	4	31	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4667	4	31	2	“Exact vengeance for the Israelites from the Midianites – after that you will be gathered to your people.”
4668	4	31	3	¶So Moses spoke to the people: “Arm men from among you for the war, to attack the Midianites and to execute the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s vengeance on Midian.
4669	4	31	4	You must send to the battle a thousand men from every tribe throughout all the tribes of Israel.”
4670	4	31	5	So a thousand from every tribe, twelve thousand armed for battle in all, were provided out of the thousands of Israel.
4671	4	31	6	¶So Moses sent them to the war, one thousand from every tribe, with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, who was in charge of the holy articles and the signal trumpets.
4672	4	31	7	They fought against the Midianites, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses, and they killed every male.
4673	4	31	8	They killed the kings of Midian in addition to those slain – Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba – five Midianite kings. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
4674	4	31	9	¶The Israelites took the women of Midian captive along with their little ones, and took all their herds, all their flocks, and all their goods as plunder.
4675	4	31	10	They burned all their towns where they lived and all their encampments.
4676	4	31	11	They took all the plunder and all the spoils, both people and animals.
4677	4	31	12	They brought the captives and the spoils and the plunder to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the Israelite community, to the camp on the rift valley plains of Moab, along the Jordan River across from Jericho.
4678	4	31	13	Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the community went out to meet them outside the camp.
4679	4	31	14	¶But Moses was furious with the officers of the army, the commanders over thousands and commanders over hundreds, who had come from service in the war.
4680	4	31	15	Moses said to them, “Have you allowed all the women to live?
4681	4	31	16	Look, these people through the counsel of Balaam caused the Israelites to act treacherously against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the matter of Peor – which resulted in the plague among the community of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!
4682	4	31	17	Now therefore kill every boy, and kill every woman who has been intimate with a man in bed.
4683	4	31	18	But all the young women who have not experienced a man’s bed will be yours.
4684	4	31	19	¶“Any of you who has killed anyone or touched any of the dead, remain outside the camp for seven days; purify yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
4685	4	31	20	You must purify each garment and everything that is made of skin, everything made of goat’s hair, and everything made of wood.”
4686	4	31	21	¶Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone into the battle, “This is the ordinance of the law that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses:
4687	4	31	22	‘Only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
4688	4	31	23	everything that may stand the fire, you are to pass through the fire, and it will be ceremonially clean, but it must still be purified with the water of purification. Anything that cannot withstand the fire you must pass through the water.
4689	4	31	24	You must wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you will be ceremonially clean, and afterward you may enter the camp.’”
4690	4	31	25	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4691	4	31	26	“You and Eleazar the priest, and all the family leaders of the community, take the sum of the plunder that was captured, both people and animals.
4692	4	31	27	Divide the plunder into two parts, one for those who took part in the war – who went out to battle – and the other for all the community.
4693	4	31	28	¶“You must exact a tribute for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from the fighting men who went out to battle: one life out of five hundred, from the people, the cattle, and from the donkeys and the sheep.
4694	4	31	29	You are to take it from their half-share and give it to Eleazar the priest for a raised offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4695	4	31	30	From the Israelites’ half-share you are to take one portion out of fifty of the people, the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep – from every kind of animal – and you are to give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s tabernacle.”
4696	4	31	31	¶So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses.
4697	4	31	32	The spoil that remained of the plunder which the fighting men had gathered was 675,000 sheep,
4698	4	31	33	72,000 cattle,
4699	4	31	34	61,000 donkeys,
4700	4	31	35	and 32,000<b> </b> young womenwho had not experienced a man’s bed.
4701	4	31	36	¶The half-portion of those who went to war numbered 337,500 sheep;
4702	4	31	37	the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s tribute from the sheep was 675.
4703	4	31	38	The cattle numbered 36,000; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s tribute was 72.
4704	4	31	39	The donkeys were 30,500, of which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s tribute was 61.
4705	4	31	40	The people were 16,000, of which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s tribute was 32 people.
4706	4	31	41	¶So Moses gave the tribute, which was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s raised offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses.
4707	4	31	42	¶From the Israelites’ half-share that Moses had separated from the fighting men,
4708	4	31	43	there were 337,500 sheep from the portion belonging to the community,
4709	4	31	44	36,000 cattle,
4710	4	31	45	30,500 donkeys,
4711	4	31	46	and 16,000 people.
4712	4	31	47	¶From the Israelites’ share Moses took one of every fifty people and animals and gave them to the Levites who were responsible for the care of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s tabernacle, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses.
4713	4	31	48	¶Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders over thousands and the commanders over hundreds, approached Moses
4714	4	31	49	and said to him, “Your servants have taken a count of the men who were in the battle, who were under our authority, and not one is missing.
4715	4	31	50	So we have brought as an offering for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> what each man found: gold ornaments, armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
4716	4	31	51	Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all of it in the form of ornaments.
4717	4	31	52	All the gold of the offering they offered up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds weighed 16,750 shekels.
4718	4	31	53	Each soldier had taken plunder for himself.
4719	4	31	54	So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
4720	4	32	1	¶Now the Reubenites and the Gadites possessed a very large number of cattle. When they saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were ideal for cattle,
4721	4	32	2	the Gadites and the Reubenites came and addressed Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community. They said,
4722	4	32	3	“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,
4723	4	32	4	the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> subdued before the community of Israel, is ideal for cattle, and your servants have cattle.”
4724	4	32	5	So they said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for our inheritance. Do not have us cross the Jordan River.”
4725	4	32	6	¶Moses said to the Gadites and the Reubenites, “Must your brothers go to war while you remain here?
4726	4	32	7	Why do you frustrate the intent of the Israelites to cross over into the land which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given them?
4727	4	32	8	Your fathers did the same thing when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.
4728	4	32	9	When they went up to the Eshcol Valley and saw the land, they frustrated the intent of the Israelites so that they did not enter the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had given them.
4729	4	32	10	So the anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was kindled that day, and he swore,
4730	4	32	11	‘Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty years old and upward who came from Egypt will see the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
4731	4	32	12	except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> wholeheartedly.’
4732	4	32	13	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anger was kindled against the Israelites, and he made them wander in the wilderness for forty years, until all that generation that had done wickedly before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was finished.
4733	4	32	14	Now look, you are standing in your fathers’ place, a brood of sinners, to increase still further the fierce wrath of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> against the Israelites.
4734	4	32	15	For if you turn away from following him, he will once again abandon them in the wilderness, and you will be the reason for their destruction.”
4735	4	32	16	¶Then they came very close to him and said, “We will build sheep folds here for our flocks and cities for our families,
4736	4	32	17	but we will maintain ourselves in armed readiness and go before the Israelites until whenever we have brought them to their place. Our descendants will be living in fortified towns as a protection against the inhabitants of the land.
4737	4	32	18	We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has his inheritance.
4738	4	32	19	For we will not accept any inheritance on the other side of the Jordan River and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this eastern side of the Jordan.”
4739	4	32	20	¶Then Moses replied, “If you will do this thing, and if you will arm yourselves for battle before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
4740	4	32	21	and if all your armed men cross the Jordan before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> until he drives out his enemies from his presence
4741	4	32	22	and the land is subdued before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, then afterward you may return and be free of your obligation to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and to Israel. This land will then be your possession in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight.
4742	4	32	23	¶“But if you do not do this, then look, you will have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. And know that your sin will find you out.
4743	4	32	24	So build cities for your descendants and pens for your sheep, but do what you have said you would do.”
4744	4	32	25	¶So the Gadites and the Reubenites replied to Moses, “Your servants will do as my lord commands.
4745	4	32	26	Our children, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock will be there in the cities of Gilead,
4746	4	32	27	but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, to do battle in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence, just as my lord says.”
4747	4	32	28	¶So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of the Israelite tribes.
4748	4	32	29	Moses said to them: “If the Gadites and the Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, each one equipped for battle in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence, and you conquer the land, then you must allot them the territory of Gilead as their possession.
4749	4	32	30	But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must receive possessions among you in Canaan.”
4750	4	32	31	Then the Gadites and the Reubenites answered, “Your servants will do what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken.
4751	4	32	32	We will cross armed in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence into the land of Canaan, and then the possession of our inheritance that we inherit will be ours on this side of the Jordan River.”
4752	4	32	33	¶So Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the realm of King Sihon of the Amorites, and the realm of King Og of Bashan, the entire land with its cities and the territory surrounding them.
4753	4	32	34	The Gadites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
4754	4	32	35	Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
4755	4	32	36	Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and constructed pens for their flocks.
4756	4	32	37	The Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
4757	4	32	38	Nebo, Baal Meon (with a change of name), and Sibmah. They renamed the cities they built.
4758	4	32	39	¶The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
4759	4	32	40	So Moses gave Gilead to Machir, son of Manasseh, and he lived there.
4760	4	32	41	Now Jair son of Manasseh went and captured their small towns and named them Havvoth Jair.
4761	4	32	42	Then Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah after his own name.
4762	4	33	1	¶These are the journeys of the Israelites, who went out of the land of Egypt by their divisions under the authority of Moses and Aaron.
4763	4	33	2	Moses recorded their departures according to their journeys, by the commandment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; now these are their journeys according to their departures.
4764	4	33	3	They departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the Passover the Israelites went out defiantly in plain sight of all the Egyptians.
4765	4	33	4	Now the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had killed among them; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> also executed judgments on their gods.
4766	4	33	5	¶The Israelites traveled from Rameses and camped in Succoth.
4767	4	33	6	¶They traveled from Succoth, and camped in Etham, which is on the edge of the desert.
4768	4	33	7	They traveled from Etham, and turned again to Pi-hahiroth, which is before Baal-Zephon; and they camped before Migdal.
4769	4	33	8	They traveled from Pi-hahiroth, and passed through the middle of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham, and camped in Marah.
4770	4	33	9	They traveled from Marah and came to Elim; in Elim there are twelve fountains of water and seventy palm trees, so they camped there.
4771	4	33	10	¶They traveled from Elim, and camped by the Red Sea.
4772	4	33	11	They traveled from the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin.
4773	4	33	12	They traveled from the wilderness of Sin and camped in Dophkah.
4774	4	33	13	And they traveled from Dophkah, and camped in Alush.
4775	4	33	14	¶They traveled from Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
4776	4	33	15	They traveled from Rephidim and camped in the desert of Sinai.
4777	4	33	16	¶They traveled from the desert of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.
4778	4	33	17	They traveled from Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
4779	4	33	18	They traveled from Hazeroth and camped in Rithmah.
4780	4	33	19	They traveled from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez.
4781	4	33	20	They traveled from Rimmon-perez and camped in Libnah.
4782	4	33	21	They traveled from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
4783	4	33	22	They traveled from Rissah and camped in Kehelathah.
4784	4	33	23	They traveled from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
4785	4	33	24	They traveled from Mount Shepher and camped in Haradah.
4786	4	33	25	They traveled from Haradah and camped in Makheloth.
4787	4	33	26	They traveled from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
4788	4	33	27	They traveled from Tahath and camped at Terah.
4789	4	33	28	They traveled from Terah and camped in Mithcah.
4790	4	33	29	They traveled from Mithcah and camped in Hashmonah.
4791	4	33	30	They traveled from Hashmonah and camped in Moseroth.
4792	4	33	31	They traveled from Moseroth and camped in Bene Jaakan.
4793	4	33	32	They traveled from Bene Jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
4794	4	33	33	They traveled from Hor-haggidgad and camped in Jotbathah.
4795	4	33	34	They traveled from Jotbathah and camped in Abronah.
4796	4	33	35	They traveled from Abronah and camped at Ezion Geber.
4797	4	33	36	They traveled from Ezion Geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.
4798	4	33	37	¶They traveled from Kadesh and camped in Mount Hor at the edge of the land of Edom.
4799	4	33	38	Aaron the priest ascended Mount Hor at the command of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and he died there in the fortieth year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt on the first day of the fifth month.
4800	4	33	39	Now Aaron was 123 years old when he died in Mount Hor.
4801	4	33	40	The king of Arad, the Canaanite king who lived in the south of the land of Canaan, heard about the approach of the Israelites.
4802	4	33	41	¶They traveled from Mount Hor and camped in Zalmonah.
4803	4	33	42	They traveled from Zalmonah and camped in Punon.
4804	4	33	43	They traveled from Punon and camped in Oboth.
4805	4	33	44	They traveled from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, on the border of Moab.
4806	4	33	45	They traveled from Iim and camped in Dibon-gad.
4807	4	33	46	They traveled from Dibon-gad and camped in Almon-diblathaim.
4808	4	33	47	They traveled from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim before Nebo.
4809	4	33	48	They traveled from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the rift valley plains by Moab along the Jordan River across from Jericho.
4810	4	33	49	They camped by the Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the rift valley plains of Moab.
4811	4	33	50	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses in the rift valley plains of Moab along the Jordan, across from Jericho. He said:
4812	4	33	51	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you have crossed the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
4813	4	33	52	you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images, all their molten images, and demolish their high places.
4814	4	33	53	You must dispossess the inhabitants of the land and live in it, for I have given you the land to possess it.
4815	4	33	54	You must divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families. To a larger group you must give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group you must give a smaller inheritance. Everyone’s inheritance must be in the place where his lot falls. You must inherit according to your ancestral tribes.
4816	4	33	55	But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, then those whom you allow to remain will be irritants in your eyes and thorns in your side, and will cause you trouble in the land where you will be living.
4817	4	33	56	And what I intended to do to them I will do to you.”
4818	4	34	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4819	4	34	2	“Give these instructions to the Israelites, and tell them: ‘When you enter Canaan, the land that has been assigned to you as an inheritance, the land of Canaan with its borders,
4820	4	34	3	your southern border will extend from the wilderness of Zin along the Edomite border, and your southern border will run eastward to the extremity of the Salt Sea,
4821	4	34	4	and then the border will turn from the south to the Scorpion Ascent, continue to Zin, and then its direction will be from the south to Kadesh Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar and pass over to Azmon.
4822	4	34	5	There the border will turn from Azmon to the Stream of Egypt, and then its direction is to the sea.
4823	4	34	6	¶“‘And for a western border you will have the Great Sea. This will be your western border.
4824	4	34	7	¶“‘And this will be your northern border: From the Great Sea you will draw a line to Mount Hor;
4825	4	34	8	from Mount Hor you will draw a line to Lebo Hamath, and the direction of the border will be to Zedad.
4826	4	34	9	The border will continue to Ziphron, and its direction will be to Hazar Enan. This will be your northern border.
4827	4	34	10	¶“‘For your eastern border you will draw a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
4828	4	34	11	The border will run down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain, and the border will descend and reach the eastern side of the Sea of Kinnereth.
4829	4	34	12	Then the border will continue down the Jordan River and its direction will be to the Salt Sea. This will be your land by its borders that surround it.’”
4830	4	34	13	¶Then Moses commanded the Israelites: “This is the land which you will inherit by lot, which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded to be given to the nine and a half tribes,
4831	4	34	14	because the tribe of the Reubenites by their families, the tribe of the Gadites by their families, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance.
4832	4	34	15	The two and a half tribes have received their inheritance on this side of the Jordan, east of Jericho, toward the sunrise.”
4833	4	34	16	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses:
4834	4	34	17	“These are the names of the men who are to allocate the land to you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.
4835	4	34	18	You must take one leader from every tribe to assist in allocating the land as an inheritance.
4836	4	34	19	These are the names of the men: from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
4837	4	34	20	from the tribe of the Simeonites, Shemuel son of Ammihud;
4838	4	34	21	from the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Kislon;
4839	4	34	22	and from the tribe of the Danites, a leader, Bukki son of Jogli.
4840	4	34	23	From the Josephites, Hanniel son of Ephod, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh;
4841	4	34	24	from the tribe of the Ephraimites, a leader, Kemuel son of Shiphtan;
4842	4	34	25	from the tribe of the Zebulunites, a leader, Elizaphan son of Parnach;
4843	4	34	26	from the tribe of the Issacharites, a leader, Paltiel son of Azzan;
4844	4	34	27	from the tribe of the Asherites, a leader, Ahihud son of Shelomi;
4845	4	34	28	and from the tribe of the Naphtalites, a leader, Pedahel son of Ammihud.”
4846	4	34	29	These are the ones whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded to divide up the inheritance among the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
4847	4	35	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses in the rift valley plains of Moab along the Jordan near Jericho. He said:
4848	4	35	2	“Instruct the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from the inheritance the Israelites will possess. You must also give the Levites grazing land around the towns.
4849	4	35	3	Thus they will have towns in which to live, and their grazing lands will be for their cattle, for their possessions, and for all their animals.
4850	4	35	4	The grazing lands around the towns that you will give to the Levites must extend to a distance of 500 yards from the town wall.
4851	4	35	5	¶“You must measure from outside the wall of the town on the east 1,000 yards, and on the south side 1,000 yards, and on the west side 1,000 yards, and on the north side 1,000 yards, with the town in the middle. This territory must belong to them as grazing land for the towns.
4852	4	35	6	Now from these towns that you will give to the Levites you must select six towns of refuge to which a person who has killed someone may flee. And you must give them forty-two other towns.
4853	4	35	7	¶“So the total of the towns you will give the Levites is forty-eight. You must give these together with their grazing lands.
4854	4	35	8	The towns you will give must be from the possession of the Israelites. From the larger tribes you must give more; and from the smaller tribes fewer. Each must contribute some of its own towns to the Levites in proportion to the inheritance allocated to each.
4855	4	35	9	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:
4856	4	35	10	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you cross over the Jordan River into the land of Canaan,
4857	4	35	11	you must then designate some towns as towns of refuge for you, to which a person who has killed someone unintentionally may flee.
4858	4	35	12	And they must stand as your towns of refuge from the avenger in order that the killer may not die until he has stood trial before the community.
4859	4	35	13	These towns that you must give shall be your six towns for refuge.
4860	4	35	14	¶“You must give three towns on this side of the Jordan, and you must give three towns in the land of Canaan; they must be towns of refuge.
4861	4	35	15	These six towns will be places of refuge for the Israelites, and for the resident foreigner, and for the settler among them, so that anyone who kills any person accidentally may flee there.
4862	4	35	16	¶“But if he hits someone with an iron tool so that he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer must surely be put to death.
4863	4	35	17	If he strikes him by throwing a stone large enough that he could die, and he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer must surely be put to death.
4864	4	35	18	Or if he strikes him with a wooden hand weapon so that he could die, and he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer must surely be put to death.
4865	4	35	19	The avenger of blood himself must kill the murderer; when he meets him, he must kill him.
4866	4	35	20	¶“But if he strikes him out of hatred or throws something at him intentionally so that he dies,
4867	4	35	21	or with enmity he strikes him with his hand and he dies, the one who struck him must surely be put to death, for he is a murderer. The avenger of blood must kill the murderer when he meets him.
4868	4	35	22	¶“But if he strikes him suddenly, without enmity, or throws anything at him unintentionally,
4869	4	35	23	or with any stone large enough that a man could die, without seeing him, and throws it at him, and he dies, even though he was not his enemy nor sought his harm,
4870	4	35	24	then the community must judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these decisions.
4871	4	35	25	The community must deliver the slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the community must restore him to the town of refuge to which he fled, and he must live there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the consecrated oil.
4872	4	35	26	But if the slayer at any time goes outside the boundary of the town to which he had fled,
4873	4	35	27	and the avenger of blood finds him outside the borders of the town of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the slayer, he will not be guilty of blood,
4874	4	35	28	because the slayer should have stayed in his town of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest, the slayer may return to the land of his possessions.
4875	4	35	29	So these things must be a statutory ordinance for you throughout your generations, in all the places where you live.
4876	4	35	30	¶“Whoever kills any person, the murderer must be put to death by the testimony of witnesses, but one witness cannot testify against any person to cause him to be put to death.
4877	4	35	31	Moreover, you must not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death; he must surely be put to death.
4878	4	35	32	And you must not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a town of refuge, to allow him to return home and live on his own land before the death of the high priest.
4879	4	35	33	¶“You must not pollute the land where you live, for blood defiles the land, and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed there, except by the blood of the person who shed it.
4880	4	35	34	Therefore do not defile the land that you will inhabit, in which I live, for I the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> live among the Israelites.”
4881	4	36	1	¶Then the heads of the family groups of the Gileadites, the descendant of Machir<b>,</b> the descendant of Manasseh, who were from the Josephite families, approached and spoke before Moses and the leaders who were the heads of the Israelite families.
4882	4	36	2	They said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the Israelites; and my lord was commanded by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
4883	4	36	3	Now if they should be married to one of the men from another Israelite tribe, their inheritance would be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry. As a result, it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
4884	4	36	4	And when the Jubilee of the Israelites is to take place, their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry. So their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our ancestral tribe.”
4885	4	36	5	¶Then Moses gave a ruling to the Israelites by the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: “What the tribe of the Josephites is saying is right.
4886	4	36	6	This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has commanded for Zelophehad’s daughters: ‘Let them marry whomever they think best, only they must marry within the family of their father’s tribe.
4887	4	36	7	In this way the inheritance of the Israelites will not be transferred from tribe to tribe. But every one of the Israelites must retain the ancestral heritage.
4888	4	36	8	And every daughter who possesses an inheritance from any of the tribes of the Israelites must become the wife of a man from any family in her father’s tribe, so that every Israelite may retain the inheritance of his fathers.
4889	4	36	9	No inheritance may pass from tribe to tribe. But every one of the tribes of the Israelites must retain its inheritance.”
4890	4	36	10	¶As the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did.
4891	4	36	11	For the daughters of Zelophehad – Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah – were married to the sons of their uncles.
4892	4	36	12	They were married into the families of the Manassehites, the descendants of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father’s family.
4893	4	36	13	¶These are the commandments and the decisions that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded the Israelites through the authority of Moses, in the rift valley plains by Moab along the Jordan River opposite Jericho.
4894	5	1	1	¶This is what Moses said to all of Israel in the Transjordanian wilderness, the arid rift valley opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di Zahab.
4895	5	1	2	Now it is ordinarily an eleven-day journey from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by way of Mount Seir.
4896	5	1	3	However, it was not until the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year that Moses addressed the Israelites just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had instructed him to do.
4897	5	1	4	This took place after the defeat of King Sihon of the Amorites, whose capital was in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, whose capital was in Ashtaroth, specifically in Edrei.
4898	5	1	5	So it was in the Transjordan, in Moab, that Moses began to deliver these words:
4899	5	1	6	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God spoke to us at Horeb and said, “You have stayed in the area of this mountain long enough.
4900	5	1	7	Head out and resume your journey. Enter the Amorite hill country, and into all its neighboring areas, including the rift valley, the hill country, the foothills, the Negev, and the coastal plain – all of Canaan and Lebanon as far as the Great River, that is, the Euphrates.
4901	5	1	8	Look! I have already given the land to you. Go, occupy the territory that I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, promised to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants.”
4902	5	1	9	I also said to you at that time, “I am no longer able to sustain you by myself.
4903	5	1	10	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has increased your population to the point that you are now as numerous as the very stars of the sky.
4904	5	1	11	Indeed, may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, make you a thousand times more numerous than you are now, blessing you just as he said he would!
4905	5	1	12	But how can I alone bear up under the burden of your hardship and strife?
4906	5	1	13	Select wise and practical men, those known among your tribes, whom I may appoint as your leaders.”
4907	5	1	14	You replied to me that what I had said to you was good.
4908	5	1	15	So I chose as your tribal leaders wise and well-known men, placing them over you as administrators of groups of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and also as other tribal officials.
4909	5	1	16	I furthermore admonished your judges at that time that they should pay attention to issues among your fellow citizens and judge fairly, whether between one person and a native Israelite or a resident foreigner.
4910	5	1	17	They must not discriminate in judgment, but hear the lowly and the great alike. Nor should they be intimidated by human beings, for judgment belongs to God. If the matter being adjudicated is too difficult for them, they should bring it before me for a hearing.
4911	5	1	18	¶So I instructed you at that time regarding everything you should do.
4912	5	1	19	Then we left Horeb and passed through all that immense, forbidding wilderness that you saw on the way to the Amorite hill country as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God had commanded us to do, finally arriving at Kadesh Barnea.
4913	5	1	20	Then I said to you, “You have come to the Amorite hill country which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God is about to give us.
4914	5	1	21	Look, he has placed the land in front of you! Go up, take possession of it, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, said to do. Do not be afraid or discouraged!”
4915	5	1	22	So all of you approached me and said, “Let’s send some men ahead of us to scout out the land and bring us back word as to how we should attack it and what the cities are like there.”
4916	5	1	23	I thought this was a good idea, so I sent twelve men from among you, one from each tribe.
4917	5	1	24	They left and went up to the hill country, coming to the Eshcol Valley, which they scouted out.
4918	5	1	25	Then they took some of the produce of the land and carried it back down to us. They also brought a report to us, saying, “The land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God is about to give us is good.”
4919	5	1	26	¶You were not willing to go up, however, but instead rebelled against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
4920	5	1	27	You complained among yourselves privately and said, “Because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hates us he brought us from Egypt to deliver us over to the Amorites so they could destroy us!
4921	5	1	28	What is going to happen to us? Our brothers have drained away our courage by describing people who are more numerous and taller than we are, and great cities whose defenses appear to be as high as heaven itself! Moreover, they said they saw Anakites there.”
4922	5	1	29	So I responded to you, “Do not be terrified of them!
4923	5	1	30	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is about to go ahead of you; he will fight for you, just as you saw him do in Egypt
4924	5	1	31	and in the wilderness, where you saw him carrying you along like a man carries his son. This he did everywhere you went until you came to this very place.”
4925	5	1	32	However, through all this you did not have confidence in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,
4926	5	1	33	the one who would go before you on the way to find places for you to camp, appearing in a fire at night and in a cloud by day to show you the way you ought to go.
4927	5	1	34	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> heard you, he became angry and made this vow:
4928	5	1	35	“Not a single person of this evil generation will see the good land that I promised to give to your ancestors!
4929	5	1	36	The exception is Caleb son of Jephunneh; he will see it and I will give him and his descendants the territory on which he has walked, because he has wholeheartedly followed me.”
4930	5	1	37	As for me, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was also angry with me on your account. He said, “You also will not be able to go there.
4931	5	1	38	However, Joshua son of Nun, your assistant, will go. Encourage him, because he will enable Israel to inherit the land.
4932	5	1	39	Also, your infants, who you thought would die on the way, and your children, who as yet do not know good from bad, will go there; I will give them the land and they will possess it.
4933	5	1	40	But as for you, turn back and head for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”
4934	5	1	41	¶Then you responded to me and admitted, “We have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. We will now go up and fight as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God has told us to do.” So you each put on your battle gear and prepared to go up to the hill country.
4935	5	1	42	But the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> told me: “Tell them this: ‘Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you and you will be defeated by your enemies.’”
4936	5	1	43	I spoke to you, but you did not listen. Instead you rebelled against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and recklessly went up to the hill country.
4937	5	1	44	The Amorite inhabitants of that area confronted you and chased you like a swarm of bees, striking you down from Seir as far as Hormah.
4938	5	1	45	Then you came back and wept before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, but he paid no attention to you whatsoever.
4939	5	1	46	Therefore, you remained at Kadesh for a long time – indeed, for the full time.
4940	5	2	1	¶Then we turned and set out toward the wilderness on the way to the Red Sea just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me to do, detouring around Mount Seir for a long time.
4941	5	2	2	At this point the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me,
4942	5	2	3	“You have circled around this mountain long enough; now turn north.
4943	5	2	4	Instruct these people as follows: ‘You are about to cross the border of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who inhabit Seir. They will be afraid of you, so watch yourselves carefully.
4944	5	2	5	Do not be hostile toward them, because I am not giving you any of their land, not even a footprint, for I have given Mount Seir as an inheritance for Esau.
4945	5	2	6	You may purchase food to eat and water to drink from them.
4946	5	2	7	All along the way I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, have blessed your every effort. I have been attentive to your travels through this great wilderness. These forty years I have been with you; you have lacked for nothing.’”
4947	5	2	8	¶So we turned away from our relatives the descendants of Esau, the inhabitants of Seir, turning from the route of the rift valley which comes up from Elat and Ezion Geber, and traveling the way of the wilderness of Moab.
4948	5	2	9	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Do not harass Moab and provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as your territory. This is because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their possession.
4949	5	2	10	(The Emites used to live there, a people as powerful, numerous, and tall as the Anakites.
4950	5	2	11	These people, as well as the Anakites, are also considered Rephaites; the Moabites call them Emites.
4951	5	2	12	Previously the Horites lived in Seir but the descendants of Esau dispossessed and destroyed them and settled in their place, just as Israel did to the land it came to possess, the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave them.)
4952	5	2	13	Now, get up and cross the Wadi Zered.” So we did so.
4953	5	2	14	Now the length of time it took for us to go from Kadesh Barnea to the crossing of Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, time for all the military men of that generation to die, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had vowed to them.
4954	5	2	15	Indeed, it was the very hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that eliminated them from within the camp until they were all gone.
4955	5	2	16	¶So it was that after all the military men had been eliminated from the community,
4956	5	2	17	the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me,
4957	5	2	18	“Today you are going to cross the border of Moab, that is, of Ar.
4958	5	2	19	But when you come close to the Ammonites, do not harass or provoke them because I am not giving you any of the Ammonites’ land as your possession; I have already given it to Lot’s descendants as their possession.”
4959	5	2	20	¶(That also is considered to be a land of the Rephaites. The Rephaites lived there originally; the Ammonites call them Zamzummites.
4960	5	2	21	They are a people as powerful, numerous, and tall as the Anakites. But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> destroyed the Rephaites in advance of the Ammonites, so they dispossessed them and settled down in their place.
4961	5	2	22	This is exactly what he did for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir when he destroyed the Horites before them so that they could dispossess them and settle in their area to this very day.
4962	5	2	23	As for the Avvites who lived in settlements as far west as Gaza, Caphtorites who came from Crete destroyed them and settled down in their place.)
4963	5	2	24	¶“Get up, make your way across Wadi Arnon. Look! I have already delivered over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Go ahead! Take it! Engage him in war!
4964	5	2	25	This very day I will begin to fill all the people of the earth with dread and to terrify them when they hear about you. They will shiver and shake in anticipation of your approach.”
4965	5	2	26	¶Then I sent messengers from the Kedemoth wilderness to King Sihon of Heshbon with an offer of peace:
4966	5	2	27	“Let me pass through your land; I will keep strictly to the roadway. I will not turn aside to the right or the left.
4967	5	2	28	Sell me food for cash so that I can eat and sell me water to drink. Just allow me to go through on foot,
4968	5	2	29	just as the descendants of Esau who live at Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan to the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God is giving us.”
4969	5	2	30	But King Sihon of Heshbon was unwilling to allow us to pass near him because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God had made him obstinate and stubborn so that he might deliver him over to you this very day.
4970	5	2	31	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Look! I have already begun to give over Sihon and his land to you. Start right now to take his land as your possession.”
4971	5	2	32	When Sihon and all his troops emerged to encounter us in battle at Jahaz,
4972	5	2	33	the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, along with his sons and everyone else.
4973	5	2	34	At that time we seized all his cities and put every one of them under divine judgment, including even the women and children; we left no survivors.
4974	5	2	35	We kept only the livestock and plunder from the cities for ourselves.
4975	5	2	36	From Aroer, which is at the edge of Wadi Arnon (it is the city in the wadi), all the way to Gilead there was not a town able to resist us – the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God gave them all to us.
4976	5	2	37	However, you did not approach the land of the Ammonites, the Wadi Jabbok, the cities of the hill country, or any place else forbidden by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.
4977	5	3	1	¶Next we set out on the route to Bashan, but King Og of Bashan and his whole army came out to meet us in battle at Edrei.
4978	5	3	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, however, said to me, “Don’t be afraid of him because I have already given him, his whole army, and his land to you. You will do to him exactly what you did to King Sihon of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon.”
4979	5	3	3	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God did indeed give over to us King Og of Bashan and his whole army and we struck them down until not a single survivor was left.
4980	5	3	4	We captured all his cities at that time – there was not a town we did not take from them – sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the dominion of Og in Bashan.
4981	5	3	5	All of these cities were fortified by high walls, gates, and locking bars; in addition there were a great many open villages.
4982	5	3	6	We put all of these under divine judgment just as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon – every occupied city, including women and children.
4983	5	3	7	But all the livestock and plunder from the cities we kept for ourselves.
4984	5	3	8	So at that time we took the land of the two Amorite kings in the Transjordan from Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon
4985	5	3	9	(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion and the Amorites call it Senir),
4986	5	3	10	all the cities of the plateau, all of Gilead and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
4987	5	3	11	Only King Og of Bashan was left of the remaining Rephaites. (It is noteworthy that his sarcophagus was made of iron. Does it not, indeed, still remain in Rabbath of the Ammonites? It is thirteen and a half feet long and six feet wide according to standard measure.)
4988	5	3	12	¶This is the land we brought under our control at that time: The territory extending from Aroer by the Wadi Arnon and half the Gilead hill country with its cities I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites.
4989	5	3	13	The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, that is, all Bashan, is called the land of Rephaim.
4990	5	3	14	Jair, son of Manasseh, took all the Argob region as far as the border with the Geshurites and Maacathites (namely Bashan) and called it by his name, Havvoth Jair, which it retains to this very day.)
4991	5	3	15	I gave Gilead to Machir.
4992	5	3	16	To the Reubenites and Gadites I allocated the territory extending from Gilead as far as Wadi Arnon (the exact middle of the wadi was a boundary) all the way to the Wadi Jabbok, the Ammonite border.
4993	5	3	17	The rift valley and the Jordan River were also a border, from the sea of Kinnereth to the sea of the rift valley (that is, the Salt Sea), beneath the slopes of Pisgah to the east.
4994	5	3	18	¶At that time I instructed you as follows: “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has given you this land for your possession. You warriors are to cross over before your fellow Israelites equipped for battle.
4995	5	3	19	But your wives, children, and livestock (of which I know you have many) may remain in the cities I have given you.
4996	5	3	20	You must fight until the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gives your countrymen victory as he did you and they take possession of the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving them on the other side of the Jordan River. Then each of you may return to his own territory that I have given you.”
4997	5	3	21	I also commanded Joshua at the same time, “You have seen everything the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God did to these two kings; he will do the same to all the kingdoms where you are going.
4998	5	3	22	Do not be afraid of them, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will personally fight for you.”
4999	5	3	23	¶Moreover, at that time I pleaded with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
5000	5	3	24	“O, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you have begun to show me your greatness and strength. (What god in heaven or earth can rival your works and mighty deeds?)
5001	5	3	25	Let me please cross over to see the good land on the other side of the Jordan River – this good hill country and the Lebanon!”
5002	5	3	26	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was angry at me because of you and would not listen to me. Instead, he said to me, “Enough of that! Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.
5003	5	3	27	Go up to the top of Pisgah and take a good look to the west, north, south, and east, for you will not be allowed to cross the Jordan.
5004	5	3	28	Commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, because he will lead these people over and will enable them to inherit the land you will see.”
5005	5	3	29	So we settled down in the valley opposite Beth Peor.
5006	5	4	1	¶Now, Israel, pay attention to the statutes and ordinances I am about to teach you, so that you might live and go on to enter and take possession of the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.
5007	5	4	2	Do not add a thing to what I command you nor subtract from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God that I am delivering to you.
5008	5	4	3	You have witnessed what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did at Baal Peor, how he eradicated from your midst everyone who followed Baal Peor.
5009	5	4	4	But you who remained faithful to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God are still alive to this very day, every one of you.
5010	5	4	5	Look! I have taught you statutes and ordinances just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God told me to do, so that you might carry them out in the land you are about to enter and possess.
5011	5	4	6	So be sure to do them, because this will testify of your wise understanding to the people who will learn of all these statutes and say, “Indeed, this great nation is a very wise people.”
5012	5	4	7	In fact, what other great nation has a god so near to them like the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God whenever we call on him?
5013	5	4	8	And what other great nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this whole law that I am about to share with you today?
5014	5	4	9	¶Again, however, pay very careful attention, lest you forget the things you have seen and disregard them for the rest of your life; instead teach them to your children and grandchildren.
5015	5	4	10	You stood before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God at Horeb and he said to me, “Assemble the people before me so that I can tell them my commands. Then they will learn to revere me all the days they live in the land, and they will instruct their children.”
5016	5	4	11	You approached and stood at the foot of the mountain, a mountain ablaze to the sky above it and yet dark with a thick cloud.
5017	5	4	12	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to you from the middle of the fire; you heard speech but you could not see anything – only a voice was heard.
5018	5	4	13	And he revealed to you the covenant he has commanded you to keep, the ten commandments, writing them on two stone tablets.
5019	5	4	14	Moreover, at that same time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded me to teach you statutes and ordinances for you to keep in the land which you are about to enter and possess.
5020	5	4	15	¶Be very careful, then, because you saw no form at the time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to you at Horeb from the middle of the fire.
5021	5	4	16	I say this so you will not corrupt yourselves by making an image in the form of any kind of figure. This includes the likeness of a human male or female,
5022	5	4	17	any kind of land animal, any bird that flies in the sky,
5023	5	4	18	anything that crawls on the ground, or any fish in the deep waters of the earth.
5024	5	4	19	When you look up to the sky and see the sun, moon, and stars – the whole heavenly creation – you must not be seduced to worship and serve them, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has assigned them to all the people of the world.
5025	5	4	20	You, however, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has selected and brought from Egypt, that iron-smelting furnace, to be his special people as you are today.
5026	5	4	21	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> became angry with me because of you and vowed that I would never cross the Jordan nor enter the good land that he is about to give you.
5027	5	4	22	So I must die here in this land; I will not cross the Jordan. But you are going over and will possess that good land.
5028	5	4	23	Be on guard so that you do not forget the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God that he has made with you, and that you do not make an image of any kind, just as he has forbidden you.
5029	5	4	24	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is a consuming fire; he is a jealous God.
5030	5	4	25	¶After you have produced children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time, if you become corrupt and make an image of any kind and do other evil things before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God that enrage him,
5031	5	4	26	I invoke heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that you will surely and swiftly be removed from the very land you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. You will not last long there because you will surely be annihilated.
5032	5	4	27	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will scatter you among the peoples and there will be very few of you among the nations where the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will drive you.
5033	5	4	28	There you will worship gods made by human hands – wood and stone that can neither see, hear, eat, nor smell.
5034	5	4	29	But if you seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God from there, you will find him, if, indeed, you seek him with all your heart and soul.
5035	5	4	30	In your distress when all these things happen to you in the latter days, if you return to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and obey him
5036	5	4	31	(for he is a merciful God), he will not let you down or destroy you, for he cannot forget the covenant with your ancestors that he confirmed by oath to them.
5037	5	4	32	¶Indeed, ask about the distant past, starting from the day God created humankind on the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether there has ever been such a great thing as this, or even a rumor of it.
5038	5	4	33	Have a people ever heard the voice of God speaking from the middle of fire, as you yourselves have, and lived to tell about it?
5039	5	4	34	Or has God ever before tried to deliver a nation from the middle of another nation, accompanied by judgments, signs, wonders, war, strength, power, and other very terrifying things like the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?
5040	5	4	35	You have been taught that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> alone is God – there is no other besides him.
5041	5	4	36	From heaven he spoke to you in order to teach you, and on earth he showed you his great fire from which you also heard his words.
5042	5	4	37	Moreover, because he loved your ancestors, he chose their descendants who followed them and personally brought you out of Egypt with his great power
5043	5	4	38	to dispossess nations greater and stronger than you and brought you here this day to give you their land as your property.
5044	5	4	39	Today realize and carefully consider that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is God in heaven above and on earth below – there is no other!
5045	5	4	40	Keep his statutes and commandments that I am setting forth today so that it may go well with you and your descendants and that you may enjoy longevity in the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is about to give you as a permanent possession.”
5046	5	4	41	¶Then Moses selected three cities in the Transjordan, toward the east.
5047	5	4	42	Anyone who accidentally killed someone without hating him at the time of the accident could flee to one of those cities and be safe.
5048	5	4	43	These cities are Bezer, in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassehites.
5049	5	4	44	¶This is the law that Moses set before the Israelites.
5050	5	4	45	These are the stipulations, statutes, and ordinances that Moses spoke to the Israelites after he had brought them out of Egypt,
5051	5	4	46	in the Transjordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon. (It is he whom Moses and the Israelites attacked after they came out of Egypt.
5052	5	4	47	They possessed his land and that of King Og of Bashan – both of whom were Amorite kings in the Transjordan, to the east.
5053	5	4	48	Their territory extended from Aroer at the edge of the Arnon valley as far as Mount Siyon – that is, Hermon –
5054	5	4	49	including all the rift valley of the Transjordan in the east to the sea of the rift valley, beneath the slopes of Pisgah.)
5055	5	5	1	¶Then Moses called all the people of Israel together and said to them: “Listen, Israel, to the statutes and ordinances that I am about to deliver to you today; learn them and be careful to keep them!
5056	5	5	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
5057	5	5	3	He did not make this covenant with our ancestors but with us, we who are here today, all of us living now.
5058	5	5	4	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke face to face with you at the mountain, from the middle of the fire.
5059	5	5	5	(I was standing between the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and you at that time to reveal the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message to you, because you were afraid of the fire and would not go up the mountain.) He said:
5060	5	5	6	¶“I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, he who brought you from the land of Egypt, from the place of slavery.
5061	5	5	7	You must not have any other gods besides me.
5062	5	5	8	You must not make for yourself an image of anything in heaven above, on earth below, or in the waters beneath.
5063	5	5	9	You must not worship or serve them, for I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, am a jealous God. I punish the sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons for the sin of the fathers who reject me,
5064	5	5	10	but I show covenant faithfulness to the thousands who choose me and keep my commandments.
5065	5	5	11	You must not make use of the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God for worthless purposes, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will not exonerate anyone who abuses his name that way.
5066	5	5	12	Be careful to observe the Sabbath day just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has commanded you.
5067	5	5	13	You are to work and do all your tasks in six days,
5068	5	5	14	but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. On that day you must not do any work, you, your son, your daughter, your male slave, your female slave, your ox, your donkey, any other animal, or the resident foreigner who lives with you, so that your male and female slaves, like yourself, may have rest.
5069	5	5	15	Recall that you were slaves in the land of Egypt and that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God brought you out of there by strength and power. That is why the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.
5070	5	5	16	Honor your father and your mother just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has commanded you to do, so that your days may be extended and that it may go well with you in the land that he is about to give you.
5071	5	5	17	You must not murder.
5072	5	5	18	You must not commit adultery.
5073	5	5	19	You must not steal.
5074	5	5	20	You must not offer false testimony against another.
5075	5	5	21	You must not desire another man’s wife, nor should you crave his house, his field, his male and female servants, his ox, his donkey, or anything else he owns.”
5076	5	5	22	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said these things to your entire assembly at the mountain from the middle of the fire, the cloud, and the darkness with a loud voice, and that was all he said. Then he inscribed the words on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
5077	5	5	23	Then, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness while the mountain was ablaze, all your tribal leaders and elders approached me.
5078	5	5	24	You said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God has shown us his great glory and we have heard him speak from the middle of the fire. It is now clear to us that God can speak to human beings and they can keep on living.
5079	5	5	25	But now, why should we die, because this intense fire will consume us! If we keep hearing the voice of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God we will die!
5080	5	5	26	Who is there from the entire human race who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the middle of the fire as we have, and has lived?
5081	5	5	27	You go near so that you can hear everything the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God is saying and then you can tell us whatever he says to you; then we will pay attention and do it.”
5082	5	5	28	When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> heard you speaking to me, he said to me, “I have heard what these people have said to you – they have spoken well.
5083	5	5	29	If only it would really be their desire to fear me and obey all my commandments in the future, so that it may go well with them and their descendants forever.
5084	5	5	30	Go and tell them, ‘Return to your tents!’
5085	5	5	31	But as for you, remain here with me so I can declare to you all the commandments, statutes, and ordinances that you are to teach them, so that they can carry them out in the land I am about to give them.”
5086	5	5	32	Be careful, therefore, to do exactly what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has commanded you; do not turn right or left!
5087	5	5	33	Walk just as he has commanded you so that you may live, that it may go well with you, and that you may live long in the land you are going to possess.
5088	5	6	1	¶Now these are the commandments, statutes, and ordinances that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God instructed me to teach you so that you may carry them out in the land where you are headed
5089	5	6	2	and that you may so revere the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God that you will keep all his statutes and commandments that I am giving you – you, your children, and your grandchildren – all your lives, to prolong your days.
5090	5	6	3	Pay attention, Israel, and be careful to do this so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in number – as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, God of your ancestors, said to you, you will have a land flowing with milk and honey.
5091	5	6	4	¶Listen, Israel: The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is our God, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is one!
5092	5	6	5	You must love the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God with your whole mind, your whole being, and all your strength.
5093	5	6	6	¶These words I am commanding you today must be kept in mind,
5094	5	6	7	and you must teach them to your children and speak of them as you sit in your house, as you walk along the road, as you lie down, and as you get up.
5095	5	6	8	You should tie them as a reminder on your forearm and fasten them as symbols on your forehead.
5096	5	6	9	Inscribe them on the doorframes of your houses and gates.
5097	5	6	10	¶Then when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God brings you to the land he promised your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to give you – a land with large, fine cities you did not build,
5098	5	6	11	houses filled with choice things you did not accumulate, hewn out cisterns you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant – and you eat your fill,
5099	5	6	12	be careful not to forget the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who brought you out of Egypt, that place of slavery.
5100	5	6	13	You must revere the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, serve him, and take oaths using only his name.
5101	5	6	14	You must not go after other gods, those of the surrounding peoples,
5102	5	6	15	for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, who is present among you, is a jealous God and his anger will erupt against you and remove you from the land.
5103	5	6	16	¶You must not put the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God to the test as you did at Massah.
5104	5	6	17	Keep his commandments very carefully, as well as the stipulations and statutes he commanded you to observe.
5105	5	6	18	Do whatever is proper and good before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> so that it may go well with you and that you may enter and occupy the good land that he promised your ancestors,
5106	5	6	19	and that you may drive out all your enemies just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said.
5107	5	6	20	¶When your children ask you later on, “What are the stipulations, statutes, and ordinances that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God commanded you?”
5108	5	6	21	you must say to them, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord </span>brought us out of Egypt in a powerful way.
5109	5	6	22	And he brought signs and great, devastating wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on his whole family before our very eyes.
5110	5	6	23	He delivered us from there so that he could give us the land he had promised our ancestors.
5111	5	6	24	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded us to obey all these statutes and to revere him so that it may always go well for us and he may preserve us, as he has to this day.
5112	5	6	25	We will be innocent if we carefully keep all these commandments before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, just as he demands.”
5113	5	7	1	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God brings you to the land that you are going to occupy and forces out many nations before you – Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, seven nations more numerous and powerful than you –
5114	5	7	2	and he delivers them over to you and you attack them, you must utterly annihilate them. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy!
5115	5	7	3	You must not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,
5116	5	7	4	for they will turn your sons away from me to worship other gods. Then the anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will erupt against you and he will quickly destroy you.
5117	5	7	5	Instead, this is what you must do to them: You must tear down their altars, shatter their sacred pillars, cut down their sacred Asherah poles, and burn up their idols.
5118	5	7	6	For you are a people holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. He has chosen you to be his people, prized above all others on the face of the earth.
5119	5	7	7	¶It is not because you were more numerous than all the other peoples that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> favored and chose you – for in fact you were the least numerous of all peoples.
5120	5	7	8	Rather it is because of his love for you and his faithfulness to the promise he solemnly vowed to your ancestors that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought you out with great power, redeeming you from the place of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
5121	5	7	9	So realize that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is the true God, the faithful God who keeps covenant faithfully with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,
5122	5	7	10	but who pays back those who hate him as they deserve and destroys them. He will not ignore those who hate him but will repay them as they deserve!
5123	5	7	11	So keep the commandments, statutes, and ordinances that I today am commanding you to do.
5124	5	7	12	¶If you obey these ordinances and are careful to do them, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will faithfully keep covenant with you as he promised your ancestors.
5125	5	7	13	He will love and bless you, and make you numerous. He will bless you with many children, with the produce of your soil, your grain, your new wine, your oil, the offspring of your oxen, and the young of your flocks in the land which he promised your ancestors to give you.
5126	5	7	14	You will be blessed beyond all peoples; there will be no barrenness among you or your livestock.
5127	5	7	15	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will protect you from all sickness, and you will not experience any of the terrible diseases that you knew in Egypt; instead he will inflict them on all those who hate you.
5128	5	7	16	¶You must destroy all the people whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is about to deliver over to you; you must not pity them or worship their gods, for that will be a snare to you.
5129	5	7	17	If you think, “These nations are more numerous than I – how can I dispossess them?”
5130	5	7	18	you must not fear them. You must carefully recall what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt,
5131	5	7	19	the great judgments you saw, the signs and wonders, the strength and power by which he brought you out – thus the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will do to all the people you fear.
5132	5	7	20	Furthermore, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will release hornets among them until the very last ones who hide from you perish.
5133	5	7	21	You must not tremble in their presence, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, who is present among you, is a great and awesome God.
5134	5	7	22	He, the God who leads you, will expel the nations little by little. You will not be allowed to destroy them all at once lest the wild animals overrun you.
5135	5	7	23	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will give them over to you; he will throw them into a great panic until they are destroyed.
5136	5	7	24	He will hand over their kings to you and you will erase their very names from memory. Nobody will be able to resist you until you destroy them.
5137	5	7	25	You must burn the images of their gods, but do not covet the silver and gold that covers them so much that you take it for yourself and thus become ensnared by it; for it is abhorrent to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5138	5	7	26	You must not bring any abhorrent thing into your house and thereby become an object of divine wrath along with it. You must absolutely detest and abhor it, for it is an object of divine wrath.
5139	5	8	1	¶You must keep carefully all these commandments I am giving you today so that you may live, increase in number, and go in and occupy the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised to your ancestors.
5140	5	8	2	Remember the whole way by which he has brought you these forty years through the wilderness so that he might, by humbling you, test you to see if you have it within you to keep his commandments or not.
5141	5	8	3	So he humbled you by making you hungry and then feeding you with unfamiliar manna. He did this to teach you that humankind cannot live by bread alone, but also by everything that comes from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s mouth.
5142	5	8	4	Your clothing did not wear out nor did your feet swell all these forty years.
5143	5	8	5	Be keenly aware that just as a parent disciplines his child, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God disciplines you.
5144	5	8	6	So you must keep his commandments, live according to his standards, and revere him.
5145	5	8	7	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is bringing you to a good land, a land of brooks, springs, and fountains flowing forth in valleys and hills,
5146	5	8	8	a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates, of olive trees and honey,
5147	5	8	9	a land where you may eat food in plenty and find no lack of anything, a land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you can mine copper.
5148	5	8	10	You will eat your fill and then praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God because of the good land he has given you.
5149	5	8	11	¶Be sure you do not forget the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God by not keeping his commandments, ordinances, and statutes that I am giving you today.
5150	5	8	12	When you eat your fill, when you build and occupy good houses,
5151	5	8	13	when your cattle and flocks increase, when you have plenty of silver and gold, and when you have abundance of everything,
5152	5	8	14	be sure you do not feel self-important and forget the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God who brought you from the land of Egypt, the place of slavery,
5153	5	8	15	and who brought you through the great, fearful wilderness of venomous serpents and scorpions, an arid place with no water. He made water flow from a flint rock and
5154	5	8	16	fed you in the wilderness with manna (which your ancestors had never before known) so that he might by humbling you test you and eventually bring good to you.
5155	5	8	17	Be careful not to say, “My own ability and skill have gotten me this wealth.”
5156	5	8	18	You must remember the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, for he is the one who gives ability to get wealth; if you do this he will confirm his covenant that he made by oath to your ancestors, even as he has to this day.
5157	5	8	19	Now if you forget the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God at all and follow other gods, worshiping and prostrating yourselves before them, I testify to you today that you will surely be annihilated.
5158	5	8	20	Just like the nations the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is about to destroy from your sight, so he will do to you because you would not obey him.
5159	5	9	1	¶Listen, Israel: Today you are about to cross the Jordan so you can dispossess the nations there, people greater and stronger than you who live in large cities with extremely high fortifications.
5160	5	9	2	They include the Anakites, a numerous and tall people whom you know about and of whom it is said, “Who is able to resist the Anakites?”
5161	5	9	3	Understand today that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God who goes before you is a devouring fire; he will defeat and subdue them before you. You will dispossess and destroy them quickly just as he has told you.
5162	5	9	4	Do not think to yourself after the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has driven them out before you, “Because of my own righteousness the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has brought me here to possess this land.” It is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is driving them out ahead of you.
5163	5	9	5	It is not because of your righteousness, or even your inner uprightness, that you have come here to possess their land. Instead, because of the wickedness of these nations the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is driving them out ahead of you in order to confirm the promise he made on oath to your ancestors, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
5164	5	9	6	Understand, therefore, that it is not because of your righteousness that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is about to give you this good land as a possession, for you are a stubborn people!
5165	5	9	7	¶Remember – don’t ever forget – how you provoked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in the wilderness; from the time you left the land of Egypt until you came to this place you were constantly rebelling against him.
5166	5	9	8	At Horeb you provoked him and he was angry enough with you to destroy you.
5167	5	9	9	When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made with you, I remained there forty days and nights, eating and drinking nothing.
5168	5	9	10	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave me the two stone tablets, written by the very finger of God, and on them was everything he said to you at the mountain from the midst of the fire at the time of that assembly.
5169	5	9	11	Now at the end of the forty days and nights the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> presented me with the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
5170	5	9	12	And he said to me, “Get up, go down at once from here because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have sinned! They have quickly turned from the way I commanded them and have made for themselves a cast metal image.”
5171	5	9	13	Moreover, he said to me, “I have taken note of these people; they are a stubborn lot!
5172	5	9	14	Stand aside and I will destroy them, obliterating their very name from memory, and I will make you into a stronger and more numerous nation than they are.”
5173	5	9	15	¶So I turned and went down the mountain while it was blazing with fire; the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.
5174	5	9	16	When I looked, you had indeed sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and had cast for yourselves a metal calf; you had quickly turned aside from the way he had commanded you!
5175	5	9	17	I grabbed the two tablets, threw them down, and shattered them before your very eyes.
5176	5	9	18	Then I again fell down before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for forty days and nights; I ate and drank nothing because of all the sin you had committed, doing such evil before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as to enrage him.
5177	5	9	19	For I was terrified at the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s intense anger that threatened to destroy you. But he listened to me this time as well.
5178	5	9	20	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was also angry enough at Aaron to kill him, but at that time I prayed for him too.
5179	5	9	21	As for your sinful thing that you had made, the calf, I took it, melted it down, ground it up until it was as fine as dust, and tossed the dust into the stream that flows down the mountain.
5180	5	9	22	Moreover, you continued to provoke the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-Hattaavah.
5181	5	9	23	And when he sent you from Kadesh-Barnea and told you, “Go up and possess the land I have given you,” you rebelled against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and would neither believe nor obey him.
5182	5	9	24	You have been rebelling against him from the very first day I knew you!
5183	5	9	25	¶I lay flat on the ground before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for forty days and nights, for he had said he would destroy you.
5184	5	9	26	I prayed to him: O, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, do not destroy your people, your valued property that you have powerfully redeemed, whom you brought out of Egypt by your strength.
5185	5	9	27	Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; ignore the stubbornness, wickedness, and sin of these people.
5186	5	9	28	Otherwise the people of the land from which you brought us will say, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was unable to bring them to the land he promised them, and because of his hatred for them he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.”
5187	5	9	29	They are your people, your valued property, whom you brought out with great strength and power.
5188	5	10	1	¶At that same time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Carve out for yourself two stone tablets like the first ones and come up the mountain to me; also make for yourself a wooden ark.
5189	5	10	2	I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the first tablets you broke, and you must put them into the ark.”
5190	5	10	3	So I made an ark of acacia wood and carved out two stone tablets just like the first ones. Then I went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.
5191	5	10	4	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> then wrote on the tablets the same words, the ten commandments, which he had spoken to you at the mountain from the middle of the fire at the time of that assembly, and he gave them to me.
5192	5	10	5	Then I turned, went down the mountain, and placed the tablets into the ark I had made – they are still there, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded me.
5193	5	10	6	¶“During those days the Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar became priest in his place.
5194	5	10	7	From there they traveled to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a place of flowing streams.
5195	5	10	8	At that time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant, to stand before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to serve him, and to formulate blessings in his name, as they do to this very day.
5196	5	10	9	Therefore Levi has no allotment or inheritance among his brothers; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is his inheritance just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God told him.
5197	5	10	10	As for me, I stayed at the mountain as I did the first time, forty days and nights. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> listened to me that time as well and decided not to destroy you.
5198	5	10	11	Then he said to me, “Get up, set out leading the people so they may go and possess the land I promised to give to their ancestors.”
5199	5	10	12	¶Now, Israel, what does the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God require of you except to revere him, to obey all his commandments, to love him, to serve him with all your mind and being,
5200	5	10	13	and to keep the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commandments and statutes that I am giving you today for your own good?
5201	5	10	14	The heavens – indeed the highest heavens – belong to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, as does the earth and everything in it.
5202	5	10	15	However, only to your ancestors did he show his loving favor, and he chose you, their descendants, from all peoples – as is apparent today.
5203	5	10	16	Therefore, cleanse your heart and stop being so stubborn!
5204	5	10	17	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God who is unbiased and takes no bribe,
5205	5	10	18	who justly treats the orphan and widow, and who loves resident foreigners, giving them food and clothing.
5206	5	10	19	So you must love the resident foreigner because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
5207	5	10	20	Revere the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, serve him, be loyal to him and take oaths only in his name.
5208	5	10	21	He is the one you should praise; he is your God, the one who has done these great and awesome things for you that you have seen.
5209	5	10	22	When your ancestors went down to Egypt, they numbered only seventy, but now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky.
5210	5	11	1	¶You must love the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and do what he requires; keep his statutes, ordinances, and commandments at all times.
5211	5	11	2	Bear in mind today that I am not speaking to your children who have not personally experienced the judgments of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, which revealed his greatness, strength, and power.
5212	5	11	3	They did not see the awesome deeds he performed in the midst of Egypt against Pharaoh king of Egypt and his whole land,
5213	5	11	4	or what he did to the army of Egypt, including their horses and chariots, when he made the waters of the Red Sea overwhelm them while they were pursuing you and he annihilated them.
5214	5	11	5	They did not see what he did to you in the wilderness before you reached this place,
5215	5	11	6	or what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth in the middle of the Israelite camp and swallowed them, their families, their tents, and all the property they brought with them.
5216	5	11	7	I am speaking to you because you are the ones who saw all the great deeds of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!
5217	5	11	8	¶Now pay attention to all the commandments I am giving you today, so that you may be strong enough to enter and possess the land where you are headed,
5218	5	11	9	and that you may enjoy long life in the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised to give to your ancestors and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
5219	5	11	10	For the land where you are headed is not like the land of Egypt from which you came, a land where you planted seed and which you irrigated by hand like a vegetable garden.
5220	5	11	11	Instead, the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy is one of hills and valleys, a land that drinks in water from the rains,
5221	5	11	12	a land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God looks after. He is constantly attentive to it from the beginning to the end of the year.
5222	5	11	13	Now, if you pay close attention to my commandments that I am giving you today and love the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and serve him with all your mind and being,
5223	5	11	14	then he promises, “I will send rain for your land in its season, the autumn and the spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine, and olive oil.
5224	5	11	15	I will provide pasture for your livestock and you will eat your fill.”
5225	5	11	16	¶Make sure you do not turn away to serve and worship other gods!
5226	5	11	17	Then the anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will erupt against you and he will close up the sky so that it does not rain. The land will not yield its produce, and you will soon be removed from the good land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is about to give you.
5227	5	11	18	Fix these words of mine into your mind and being, and tie them as a reminder on your hands and let them be symbols on your forehead.
5228	5	11	19	Teach them to your children and speak of them as you sit in your house, as you walk along the road, as you lie down, and as you get up.
5229	5	11	20	Inscribe them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates
5230	5	11	21	so that your days and those of your descendants may be extended in the land which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised to give to your ancestors, like the days of heaven itself.
5231	5	11	22	For if you carefully observe all of these commandments I am giving you and love the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, live according to his standards, and remain loyal to him,
5232	5	11	23	then he will drive out all these nations ahead of you, and you will dispossess nations greater and stronger than you.
5233	5	11	24	Every place you set your foot will be yours; your border will extend from the desert to Lebanon and from the River (that is, the Euphrates) as far as the Mediterranean Sea.
5234	5	11	25	Nobody will be able to resist you; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will spread the fear and terror of you over the whole land on which you walk, just as he promised you.
5235	5	11	26	¶Take note – I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:
5236	5	11	27	the blessing if you take to heart the commandments of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God that I am giving you today,
5237	5	11	28	and the curse if you pay no attention to his commandments and turn from the way I am setting before you today to pursue other gods you have not known.
5238	5	11	29	When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God brings you into the land you are to possess, you must pronounce the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
5239	5	11	30	Are they not across the Jordan River, toward the west, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the rift valley opposite Gilgal near the oak of Moreh?
5240	5	11	31	For you are about to cross the Jordan to possess the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you, and you will possess and inhabit it.
5241	5	11	32	Be certain to keep all the statutes and ordinances that I am presenting to you today.
5242	5	12	1	¶These are the statutes and ordinances you must be careful to obey as long as you live in the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, has given you to possess.
5243	5	12	2	You must by all means destroy all the places where the nations you are about to dispossess worship their gods – on the high mountains and hills and under every leafy tree.
5244	5	12	3	You must tear down their altars, shatter their sacred pillars, burn up their sacred Asherah poles, and cut down the images of their gods; you must eliminate their very memory from that place.
5245	5	12	4	You must not worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God the way they worship.
5246	5	12	5	But you must seek only the place he chooses from all your tribes to establish his name as his place of residence, and you must go there.
5247	5	12	6	And there you must take your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the personal offerings you have prepared, your votive offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
5248	5	12	7	Both you and your families must feast there before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and rejoice in all the output of your labor with which he has blessed you.
5249	5	12	8	You must not do like we are doing here today, with everyone doing what seems best to him,
5250	5	12	9	for you have not yet come to the final stop and inheritance the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you.
5251	5	12	10	When you do go across the Jordan River and settle in the land he is granting you as an inheritance and you find relief from all the enemies who surround you, you will live in safety.
5252	5	12	11	Then you must come to the place the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God chooses for his name to reside, bringing everything I am commanding you – your burnt offerings, sacrifices, tithes, the personal offerings you have prepared, and all your choice votive offerings which you devote to him.
5253	5	12	12	You shall rejoice in the presence of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, along with your sons, daughters, male and female servants, and the Levites in your villages (since they have no allotment or inheritance with you).
5254	5	12	13	Make sure you do not offer burnt offerings in any place you wish,
5255	5	12	14	for you may do so only in the place the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> chooses in one of your tribal areas – there you may do everything I am commanding you.
5256	5	12	15	¶On the other hand, you may slaughter and eat meat as you please when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God blesses you in all your villages. Both the ritually pure and impure may eat it, whether it is a gazelle or an ibex.
5257	5	12	16	However, you must not eat blood – pour it out on the ground like water.
5258	5	12	17	You will not be allowed to eat in your villages your tithe of grain, new wine, olive oil, the firstborn of your herd and flock, any votive offerings you have vowed, or your freewill and personal offerings.
5259	5	12	18	Only in the presence of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God may you eat these, in the place he chooses. This applies to you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, and the Levites in your villages. In that place you will rejoice before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in all the output of your labor.
5260	5	12	19	Be careful not to overlook the Levites as long as you live in the land.
5261	5	12	20	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God extends your borders as he said he would do and you say, “I want to eat meat just as I please,” you may do so as you wish.
5262	5	12	21	If the place he chooses to locate his name is too far for you, you may slaughter any of your herd and flock he has given you just as I have stipulated; you may eat them in your villages just as you wish.
5263	5	12	22	Like you eat the gazelle or ibex, so you may eat these; the ritually impure and pure alike may eat them.
5264	5	12	23	However, by no means eat the blood, for the blood is life itself – you must not eat the life with the meat!
5265	5	12	24	You must not eat it! You must pour it out on the ground like water.
5266	5	12	25	You must not eat it so that it may go well with you and your children after you; you will be doing what is right in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight.
5267	5	12	26	Only the holy things and votive offerings that belong to you, you must pick up and take to the place the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will choose.
5268	5	12	27	You must offer your burnt offerings, both meat and blood, on the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God; the blood of your other sacrifices you must pour out on his altar while you eat the meat.
5269	5	12	28	Pay careful attention to all these things I am commanding you so that it may always go well with you and your children after you when you do what is good and right in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5270	5	12	29	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God eliminates the nations from the place where you are headed and you dispossess them, you will settle down in their land.
5271	5	12	30	After they have been destroyed from your presence, be careful not to be ensnared like they are; do not pursue their gods and say, “How do these nations serve their gods? I will do the same.”
5272	5	12	31	You must not worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God the way they do! For everything that is abhorrent to him, everything he hates, they have done when worshiping their gods. They even burn up their sons and daughters before their gods!
5273	5	12	32	¶(13:1) You must be careful to do everything I am commanding you. Do not add to it or subtract from it!
5274	5	13	1	Suppose a prophet or one who foretells by dreams should appear among you and show you a sign or wonder,
5275	5	13	2	and the sign or wonder should come to pass concerning what he said to you, namely, “Let us follow other gods” – gods whom you have not previously known – “and let us serve them.”
5276	5	13	3	You must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will be testing you to see if you love him with all your mind and being.
5277	5	13	4	You must follow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and revere only him; and you must observe his commandments, obey him, serve him, and remain loyal to him.
5278	5	13	5	As for that prophet or dreamer, he must be executed because he encouraged rebellion against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God who brought you from the land of Egypt, redeeming you from that place of slavery, and because he has tried to entice you from the way the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has commanded you to go. In this way you must purge out evil from within.
5279	5	13	6	¶Suppose your own full brother, your son, your daughter, your beloved wife, or your closest friend should seduce you secretly and encourage you to go and serve other gods that neither you nor your ancestors have previously known,
5280	5	13	7	the gods of the surrounding people (whether near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other).
5281	5	13	8	You must not give in to him or even listen to him; do not feel sympathy for him or spare him or cover up for him.
5282	5	13	9	Instead, you must kill him without fail! Your own hand must be the first to strike him, and then the hands of the whole community.
5283	5	13	10	You must stone him to death because he tried to entice you away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, who delivered you from the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.
5284	5	13	11	Thus all Israel will hear and be afraid; no longer will they continue to do evil like this among you.
5285	5	13	12	¶Suppose you should hear in one of your cities, which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you as a place to live, that
5286	5	13	13	some evil people have departed from among you to entice the inhabitants of their cities, saying, “Let’s go and serve other gods” (whom you have not known before).
5287	5	13	14	You must investigate thoroughly and inquire carefully. If it is indeed true that such a disgraceful thing is being done among you,
5288	5	13	15	you must by all means slaughter the inhabitants of that city with the sword; annihilate with the sword everyone in it, as well as the livestock.
5289	5	13	16	You must gather all of its plunder into the middle of the plaza and burn the city and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. It will be an abandoned ruin forever – it must never be rebuilt again.
5290	5	13	17	You must not take for yourself anything that has been placed under judgment. Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will relent from his intense anger, show you compassion, have mercy on you, and multiply you as he promised your ancestors.
5291	5	13	18	Thus you must obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, keeping all his commandments that I am giving you today and doing what is right before him.
5292	5	14	1	¶You are children of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave your forehead bald for the sake of the dead.
5293	5	14	2	For you are a people holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. He has chosen you to be his people, prized above all others on the face of the earth.
5294	5	14	3	¶You must not eat any forbidden thing.
5295	5	14	4	These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,
5296	5	14	5	the ibex, the gazelle, the deer, the wild goat, the antelope, the wild oryx, and the mountain sheep.
5297	5	14	6	You may eat any animal that has hooves divided into two parts and that chews the cud.
5298	5	14	7	However, you may not eat the following animals among those that chew the cud or those that have divided hooves: the camel, the hare, and the rock badger. (Although they chew the cud, they do not have divided hooves and are therefore ritually impure to you).
5299	5	14	8	Also the pig is ritually impure to you; though it has divided hooves, it does not chew the cud. You may not eat their meat or even touch their remains.
5300	5	14	9	¶These you may eat from among water creatures: anything with fins and scales you may eat,
5301	5	14	10	but whatever does not have fins and scales you may not eat; it is ritually impure to you.
5302	5	14	11	¶All ritually clean birds you may eat.
5303	5	14	12	These are the ones you may not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,
5304	5	14	13	the kite, the black kite, the dayyah after its species,
5305	5	14	14	every raven after its species,
5306	5	14	15	the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, the falcon after its species,
5307	5	14	16	the little owl, the long-eared owl, the white owl,
5308	5	14	17	the jackdaw, the carrion vulture, the cormorant,
5309	5	14	18	the stork, the heron after its species, the hoopoe, the bat.
5310	5	14	19	¶And any swarming winged thing is impure to you – they may not be eaten.
5311	5	14	20	You may eat any clean winged creature.
5312	5	14	21	You may not eat any corpse, though you may give it to the resident foreigner who is living in your villages and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. You are a people holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. Do not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.
5313	5	14	22	¶You must be certain to tithe all the produce of your seed that comes from the field year after year.
5314	5	14	23	In the presence of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God you must eat from the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your olive oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the place he chooses to locate his name, so that you may learn to revere the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God always.
5315	5	14	24	When he blesses you, if the place where he chooses to locate his name is distant,
5316	5	14	25	you may convert the tithe into money, secure the money, and travel to the place the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God chooses for himself.
5317	5	14	26	Then you may spend the money however you wish for cattle, sheep, wine, beer, or whatever you desire. You and your household may eat there in the presence of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and enjoy it.
5318	5	14	27	As for the Levites in your villages, you must not ignore them, for they have no allotment or inheritance along with you.
5319	5	14	28	At the end of every three years you must bring all the tithe of your produce, in that very year, and you must store it up in your villages.
5320	5	14	29	Then the Levites (because they have no allotment or inheritance with you), the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows of your villages may come and eat their fill so that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God may bless you in all the work you do.
5321	5	15	1	¶At the end of every seven years you must declare a cancellation of debts.
5322	5	15	2	This is the nature of the cancellation: Every creditor must remit what he has loaned to another person; he must not force payment from his fellow Israelite, for it is to be recognized as “the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s cancellation of debts.”
5323	5	15	3	You may exact payment from a foreigner, but whatever your fellow Israelite owes you, you must remit.
5324	5	15	4	However, there should not be any poor among you, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will surely bless you in the land that he is giving you as an inheritance,
5325	5	15	5	if you carefully obey him by keeping all these commandments that I am giving you today.
5326	5	15	6	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will bless you just as he has promised; you will lend to many nations but will not borrow from any, and you will rule over many nations but they will not rule over you.
5327	5	15	7	¶If a fellow Israelite from one of your villages in the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you should be poor, you must not harden your heart or be insensitive to his impoverished condition.
5328	5	15	8	Instead, you must be sure to open your hand to him and generously lend him whatever he needs.
5329	5	15	9	Be careful lest you entertain the wicked thought that the seventh year, the year of cancellation of debts, has almost arrived, and your attitude be wrong toward your impoverished fellow Israelite and you do not lend him anything; he will cry out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> against you and you will be regarded as having sinned.
5330	5	15	10	You must by all means lend to him and not be upset by doing it, for because of this the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you attempt.
5331	5	15	11	There will never cease to be some poor people in the land; therefore, I am commanding you to make sure you open your hand to your fellow Israelites who are needy and poor in your land.
5332	5	15	12	¶If your fellow Hebrew – whether male or female – is sold to you and serves you for six years, then in the seventh year you must let that servant go free.
5333	5	15	13	If you set them free, you must not send them away empty-handed.
5334	5	15	14	You must supply them generously from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress – as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has blessed you, you must give to them.
5335	5	15	15	Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God redeemed you; therefore, I am commanding you to do this thing today.
5336	5	15	16	However, if the servant says to you, “I do not want to leave you,” because he loves you and your household, since he is well off with you,
5337	5	15	17	you shall take an awl and pierce a hole through his ear to the door. Then he will become your servant permanently (this applies to your female servant as well).
5338	5	15	18	You should not consider it difficult to let him go free, for he will have served you for six years, twice the time of a hired worker; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will bless you in everything you do.
5339	5	15	19	¶You must set apart for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God every firstborn male born to your herds and flocks. You must not work the firstborn of your bulls or shear the firstborn of your flocks.
5340	5	15	20	You and your household must eat them annually before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in the place he chooses.
5341	5	15	21	If they have any kind of blemish – lameness, blindness, or anything else – you may not offer them as a sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5342	5	15	22	You may eat it in your villages, whether you are ritually impure or clean, just as you would eat a gazelle or an ibex.
5343	5	15	23	However, you must not eat its blood; you must pour it out on the ground like water.
5344	5	16	1	¶Observe the month Abib and keep the Passover to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, for in that month he brought you out of Egypt by night.
5345	5	16	2	You must sacrifice the Passover animal (from the flock or the herd) to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in the place where he chooses to locate his name.
5346	5	16	3	You must not eat any yeast with it; for seven days you must eat bread made without yeast, as symbolic of affliction, for you came out of Egypt hurriedly. You must do this so you will remember for the rest of your life the day you came out of the land of Egypt.
5347	5	16	4	There must not be a scrap of yeast within your land for seven days, nor can any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until the next morning.
5348	5	16	5	You may not sacrifice the Passover in just any of your villages that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you,
5349	5	16	6	but you must sacrifice it in the evening in the place where he chooses to locate his name, at sunset, the time of day you came out of Egypt.
5350	5	16	7	You must cook and eat it in the place the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God chooses; you may return the next morning to your tents.
5351	5	16	8	You must eat bread made without yeast for six days. The seventh day you are to hold an assembly for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God; you must not do any work on that day.
5352	5	16	9	¶You must count seven weeks; you must begin to count them from the time you begin to harvest the standing grain.
5353	5	16	10	Then you are to celebrate the Feast of Weeks before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God with the voluntary offering that you will bring, in proportion to how he has blessed you.
5354	5	16	11	You shall rejoice before him – you, your son, your daughter, your male and female slaves, the Levites in your villages, the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows among you – in the place where the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> chooses to locate his name.
5355	5	16	12	Furthermore, remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and so be careful to observe these statutes.
5356	5	16	13	¶You must celebrate the Feast of Shelters for seven days, at the time of the grain and grape harvest.
5357	5	16	14	You are to rejoice in your festival, you, your son, your daughter, your male and female slaves, the Levites, the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows who are in your villages.
5358	5	16	15	You are to celebrate the festival seven days before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in the place he chooses, for he will bless you in all your productivity and in whatever you do; so you will indeed rejoice!
5359	5	16	16	Three times a year all your males must appear before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in the place he chooses for the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Shelters; and they must not appear before him empty-handed.
5360	5	16	17	Every one of you must give as you are able, according to the blessing of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God that he has given you.
5361	5	16	18	¶You must appoint judges and civil servants for each tribe in all your villages that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you, and they must judge the people fairly.
5362	5	16	19	You must not pervert justice or show favor. Do not take a bribe, for bribes blind the eyes of the wise and distort the words of the righteous.
5363	5	16	20	You must pursue justice alone so that you may live and inherit the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you.
5364	5	16	21	¶You must not plant any kind of tree as a sacred Asherah pole near the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God which you build for yourself.
5365	5	16	22	You must not erect a sacred pillar, a thing the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God detests.
5366	5	17	1	You must not sacrifice to him a bull or sheep that has a blemish or any other defect, because that is considered offensive to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5367	5	17	2	Suppose a man or woman is discovered among you – in one of your villages that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you – who sins before the Lord your God and breaks his covenant
5368	5	17	3	by serving other gods and worshiping them – the sun, moon, or any other heavenly bodies which I have not permitted you to worship.
5369	5	17	4	When it is reported to you and you hear about it, you must investigate carefully. If it is indeed true that such a disgraceful thing is being done in Israel,
5370	5	17	5	you must bring to your city gates that man or woman who has done this wicked thing – that very man or woman – and you must stone that person to death.
5371	5	17	6	At the testimony of two or three witnesses they must be executed. They cannot be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
5372	5	17	7	The witnesses must be first to begin the execution, and then all the people are to join in afterward. In this way you will purge evil from among you.
5373	5	17	8	¶If a matter is too difficult for you to judge – bloodshed, legal claim, or assault – matters of controversy in your villages – you must leave there and go up to the place the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God chooses.
5374	5	17	9	You will go to the Levitical priests and the judge in office in those days and seek a solution; they will render a verdict.
5375	5	17	10	You must then do as they have determined at that place the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> chooses. Be careful to do just as you are taught.
5376	5	17	11	You must do what you are instructed, and the verdict they pronounce to you, without fail. Do not deviate right or left from what they tell you.
5377	5	17	12	The person who pays no attention to the priest currently serving the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God there, or to the judge – that person must die, so that you may purge evil from Israel.
5378	5	17	13	Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and not be so presumptuous again.
5379	5	17	14	¶When you come to the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you and take it over and live in it and then say, “I will select a king like all the nations surrounding me,”
5380	5	17	15	you must select without fail a king whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God chooses. From among your fellow citizens you must appoint a king – you may not designate a foreigner who is not one of your fellow Israelites.
5381	5	17	16	Moreover, he must not accumulate horses for himself or allow the people to return to Egypt to do so, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said you must never again return that way.
5382	5	17	17	Furthermore, he must not marry many wives lest his affections turn aside, and he must not accumulate much silver and gold.
5383	5	17	18	When he sits on his royal throne he must make a copy of this law on a scroll given to him by the Levitical priests.
5384	5	17	19	It must be with him constantly and he must read it as long as he lives, so that he may learn to revere the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God and observe all the words of this law and these statutes and carry them out.
5385	5	17	20	Then he will not exalt himself above his fellow citizens or turn from the commandments to the right or left, and he and his descendants will enjoy many years ruling over his kingdom in Israel.
5386	5	18	1	¶The Levitical priests – indeed, the entire tribe of Levi – will have no allotment or inheritance with Israel; they may eat the burnt offerings of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and of his inheritance.
5387	5	18	2	They will have no inheritance in the midst of their fellow Israelites; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> alone is their inheritance, just as he had told them.
5388	5	18	3	This shall be the priests’ fair allotment from the people who offer sacrifices, whether bull or sheep – they must give to the priest the shoulder, the jowls, and the stomach.
5389	5	18	4	You must give them the best of your grain, new wine, and olive oil, as well as the best of your wool when you shear your flocks.
5390	5	18	5	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has chosen them and their sons from all your tribes to stand and serve in his name permanently.
5391	5	18	6	Suppose a Levite comes by his own free will from one of your villages, from any part of Israel where he is living, to the place the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> chooses
5392	5	18	7	and serves in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God like his fellow Levites who stand there before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
5393	5	18	8	He must eat the same share they do, despite any profits he may gain from the sale of his family’s inheritance.
5394	5	18	9	¶When you enter the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you, you must not learn the abhorrent practices of those nations.
5395	5	18	10	There must never be found among you anyone who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, anyone who practices divination, an omen reader, a soothsayer, a sorcerer,
5396	5	18	11	one who casts spells, one who conjures up spirits, a practitioner of the occult, or a necromancer.
5397	5	18	12	Whoever does these things is abhorrent to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and because of these detestable things the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is about to drive them out from before you.
5398	5	18	13	You must be blameless before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5399	5	18	14	Those nations that you are about to dispossess listen to omen readers and diviners, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has not given you permission to do such things.
5400	5	18	15	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you – from your fellow Israelites; you must listen to him.
5401	5	18	16	This accords with what happened at Horeb in the day of the assembly. You asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God: “Please do not make us hear the voice of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God any more or see this great fire any more lest we die.”
5402	5	18	17	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> then said to me, “What they have said is good.
5403	5	18	18	I will raise up a prophet like you for them from among their fellow Israelites. I will put my words in his mouth and he will speak to them whatever I command.
5404	5	18	19	I will personally hold responsible anyone who then pays no attention to the words that prophet speaks in my name.
5405	5	18	20	¶“But if any prophet presumes to speak anything in my name that I have not authorized him to speak, or speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet must die.
5406	5	18	21	Now if you say to yourselves, ‘How can we tell that a message is not from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?’ –
5407	5	18	22	whenever a prophet speaks in my name and the prediction is not fulfilled, then I have not spoken it; the prophet has presumed to speak it, so you need not fear him.”
5408	5	19	1	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God destroys the nations whose land he is about to give you and you dispossess them and settle in their cities and houses,
5409	5	19	2	you must set apart for yourselves three cities in the middle of your land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you as a possession.
5410	5	19	3	You shall build a roadway and divide into thirds the whole extent of your land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is providing as your inheritance; anyone who kills another person should flee to the closest of these cities.
5411	5	19	4	Now this is the law pertaining to one who flees there in order to live, if he has accidentally killed another without hating him at the time of the accident.
5412	5	19	5	Suppose he goes with someone else to the forest to cut wood and when he raises the ax to cut the tree, the ax head flies loose from the handle and strikes his fellow worker so hard that he dies. The person responsible may then flee to one of these cities to save himself.
5413	5	19	6	Otherwise the blood avenger will chase after the killer in the heat of his anger, eventually overtake him, and kill him, though this is not a capital case since he did not hate him at the time of the accident.
5414	5	19	7	Therefore, I am commanding you to set apart for yourselves three cities.
5415	5	19	8	If the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God enlarges your borders as he promised your ancestors and gives you all the land he pledged to them,
5416	5	19	9	and then you are careful to observe all these commandments I am giving you today (namely, to love the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and to always walk in his ways), then you must add three more cities to these three.
5417	5	19	10	You must not shed innocent blood in your land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, for that would make you guilty.
5418	5	19	11	However, suppose a person hates someone else and stalks him, attacks him, kills him, and then flees to one of these cities.
5419	5	19	12	The elders of his own city must send for him and remove him from there to deliver him over to the blood avenger to die.
5420	5	19	13	You must not pity him, but purge out the blood of the innocent from Israel, so that it may go well with you.
5421	5	19	14	¶You must not encroach on your neighbor’s property, which will have been defined in the inheritance you will obtain in the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you.
5422	5	19	15	¶A single witness may not testify against another person for any trespass or sin that he commits. A matter may be legally established only on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
5423	5	19	16	If a false witness testifies against another person and accuses him of a crime,
5424	5	19	17	then both parties to the controversy must stand before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, that is, before the priests and judges who will be in office in those days.
5425	5	19	18	The judges will thoroughly investigate the matter, and if the witness should prove to be false and to have given false testimony against the accused,
5426	5	19	19	you must do to him what he had intended to do to the accused. In this way you will purge evil from among you.
5427	5	19	20	The rest of the people will hear and become afraid to keep doing such evil among you.
5428	5	19	21	You must not show pity; the principle will be a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, and a foot for a foot.
5429	5	20	1	¶When you go to war against your enemies and see chariotry and troops who outnumber you, do not be afraid of them, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, is with you.
5430	5	20	2	As you move forward for battle, the priest will approach and say to the soldiers,
5431	5	20	3	“Listen, Israel! Today you are moving forward to do battle with your enemies. Do not be fainthearted. Do not fear and tremble or be terrified because of them,
5432	5	20	4	for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God goes with you to fight on your behalf against your enemies to give you victory.”
5433	5	20	5	Moreover, the officers are to say to the troops, “Who among you has built a new house and not dedicated it? He may go home, lest he die in battle and someone else dedicate it.
5434	5	20	6	Or who among you has planted a vineyard and not benefited from it? He may go home, lest he die in battle and someone else benefit from it.
5435	5	20	7	Or who among you has become engaged to a woman but has not married her? He may go home, lest he die in battle and someone else marry her.”
5436	5	20	8	In addition, the officers are to say to the troops, “Who among you is afraid and fainthearted? He may go home so that he will not make his fellow soldier’s heart as fearful as his own.”
5437	5	20	9	Then, when the officers have finished speaking, they must appoint unit commanders to lead the troops.
5438	5	20	10	¶When you approach a city to wage war against it, offer it terms of peace.
5439	5	20	11	If it accepts your terms and submits to you, all the people found in it will become your slaves.
5440	5	20	12	If it does not accept terms of peace but makes war with you, then you are to lay siege to it.
5441	5	20	13	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will deliver it over to you and you must kill every single male by the sword.
5442	5	20	14	However, the women, little children, cattle, and anything else in the city – all its plunder – you may take for yourselves as spoil. You may take from your enemies the plunder that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has given you.
5443	5	20	15	This is how you are to deal with all those cities located far from you, those that do not belong to these nearby nations.
5444	5	20	16	¶As for the cities of these peoples that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is going to give you as an inheritance, you must not allow a single living thing to survive.
5445	5	20	17	Instead you must utterly annihilate them – the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites – just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has commanded you,
5446	5	20	18	so that they cannot teach you all the abhorrent ways they worship their gods, causing you to sin against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5447	5	20	19	If you besiege a city for a long time while attempting to capture it, you must not chop down its trees, for you may eat fruit from them and should not cut them down. A tree in the field is not human that you should besiege it!
5448	5	20	20	However, you may chop down any tree you know is not suitable for food, and you may use it to build siege works against the city that is making war with you until that city falls.
5449	5	21	1	¶If a homicide victim should be found lying in a field in the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you, and no one knows who killed him,
5450	5	21	2	your elders and judges must go out and measure how far it is to the cities in the vicinity of the corpse.
5451	5	21	3	Then the elders of the city nearest to the corpse must take from the herd a heifer that has not been worked – that has never pulled with the yoke –
5452	5	21	4	and bring the heifer down to a wadi with flowing water, to a valley that is neither plowed nor sown. There at the wadi they are to break the heifer’s neck.
5453	5	21	5	Then the Levitical priests will approach (for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has chosen them to serve him and to pronounce blessings in his name, and to decide every judicial verdict)
5454	5	21	6	and all the elders of that city nearest the corpse must wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.
5455	5	21	7	Then they must proclaim, “Our hands have not spilled this blood, nor have we witnessed the crime.
5456	5	21	8	Do not blame your people Israel whom you redeemed, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and do not hold them accountable for the bloodshed of an innocent person.” Then atonement will be made for the bloodshed.
5457	5	21	9	In this manner you will purge out the guilt of innocent blood from among you, for you must do what is right before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
5458	5	21	10	¶When you go out to do battle with your enemies and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God allows you to prevail and you take prisoners,
5459	5	21	11	if you should see among them an attractive woman whom you wish to take as a wife,
5460	5	21	12	you may bring her back to your house. She must shave her head, trim her nails,
5461	5	21	13	discard the clothing she was wearing when captured, and stay in your house, lamenting for her father and mother for a full month. After that you may sleep with her and become her husband and she your wife.
5462	5	21	14	If you are not pleased with her, then you must let her go where she pleases. You cannot in any case sell her; you must not take advantage of her, since you have already humiliated her.
5463	5	21	15	¶Suppose a man has two wives, one whom he loves more than the other, and they both bear him sons, with the firstborn being the child of the less loved wife.
5464	5	21	16	In the day he divides his inheritance he must not appoint as firstborn the son of the favorite wife in place of the other wife’s son who is actually the firstborn.
5465	5	21	17	Rather, he must acknowledge the son of the less loved wife as firstborn and give him the double portion of all he has, for that son is the beginning of his father’s procreative power – to him should go the right of the firstborn.
5466	5	21	18	¶If a person has a stubborn, rebellious son who pays no attention to his father or mother, and they discipline him to no avail,
5467	5	21	19	his father and mother must seize him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his city.
5468	5	21	20	They must declare to the elders of his city, “Our son is stubborn and rebellious and pays no attention to what we say – he is a glutton and drunkard.”
5469	5	21	21	Then all the men of his city must stone him to death. In this way you will purge out wickedness from among you, and all Israel will hear about it and be afraid.
5470	5	21	22	¶If a person commits a sin punishable by death and is executed, and you hang the corpse on a tree,
5471	5	21	23	his body must not remain all night on the tree; instead you must make certain you bury him that same day, for the one who is left exposed on a tree is cursed by God. You must not defile your land which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance.
5472	5	22	1	¶When you see your neighbor’s ox or sheep going astray, do not ignore it; you must return it without fail to your neighbor.
5473	5	22	2	If the owner does not live near you or you do not know who the owner is, then you must corral the animal at your house and let it stay with you until the owner looks for it; then you must return it to him.
5474	5	22	3	You shall do the same to his donkey, his clothes, or anything else your neighbor has lost and you have found; you must not refuse to get involved.
5475	5	22	4	When you see your neighbor’s donkey or ox fallen along the road, do not ignore it; instead, you must be sure to help him get the animal on its feet again.
5476	5	22	5	¶A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor should a man dress up in women’s clothing, for anyone who does this is offensive to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5477	5	22	6	¶If you happen to notice a bird’s nest along the road, whether in a tree or on the ground, and there are chicks or eggs with the mother bird sitting on them, you must not take the mother from the young.
5478	5	22	7	You must be sure to let the mother go, but you may take the young for yourself. Do this so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life.
5479	5	22	8	¶If you build a new house, you must construct a guard rail around your roof to avoid being culpable in the event someone should fall from it.
5480	5	22	9	¶You must not plant your vineyard with two kinds of seed; otherwise the entire yield, both of the seed you plant and the produce of the vineyard, will be defiled.
5481	5	22	10	You must not plow with an ox and a donkey harnessed together.
5482	5	22	11	You must not wear clothing made with wool and linen meshed together.
5483	5	22	12	You shall make yourselves tassels for the four corners of the clothing you wear.
5484	5	22	13	¶Suppose a man marries a woman, sleeps with her, and then rejects her,
5485	5	22	14	accusing her of impropriety and defaming her reputation by saying, “I married this woman but when I approached her for marital relations I discovered she was not a virgin!”
5486	5	22	15	Then the father and mother of the young woman must produce the evidence of virginity for the elders of the city at the gate.
5487	5	22	16	The young woman’s father must say to the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man and he has rejected her.
5488	5	22	17	Moreover, he has raised accusations of impropriety by saying, ‘I discovered your daughter was not a virgin,’ but this is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity!” The cloth must then be spread out before the city’s elders.
5489	5	22	18	The elders of that city must then seize the man and punish him.
5490	5	22	19	They will fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them to the young woman’s father, for the man who made the accusation ruined the reputation of an Israelite virgin. She will then become his wife and he may never divorce her as long as he lives.
5491	5	22	20	¶But if the accusation is true and the young woman was not a virgin,
5492	5	22	21	the men of her city must bring the young woman to the door of her father’s house and stone her to death, for she has done a disgraceful thing in Israel by behaving like a prostitute while living in her father’s house. In this way you will purge evil from among you.
5493	5	22	22	¶If a man is discovered in bed with a married woman both the man lying in bed with the woman and the woman herself must die; in this way you will purge evil from Israel.
5494	5	22	23	¶If a virgin is engaged to a man and another man meets her in the city and goes to bed with her,
5495	5	22	24	you must bring the two of them to the gate of that city and stone them to death, the young woman because she did not cry out though in the city and the man because he violated his neighbor’s fiancée; in this way you will purge evil from among you.
5496	5	22	25	But if the man came across the engaged woman in the field and overpowered her and raped her, then only the rapist must die.
5497	5	22	26	You must not do anything to the young woman – she has done nothing deserving of death. This case is the same as when someone attacks another person and murders him,
5498	5	22	27	for the man met her in the field and the engaged woman cried out, but there was no one to rescue her.
5499	5	22	28	¶Suppose a man comes across a virgin who is not engaged and takes hold of her and sleeps with her and they are discovered.
5500	5	22	29	The man who has slept with her must pay her father fifty shekels of silver and she must become his wife. Because he has humiliated her, he may never divorce her as long as he lives.
5501	5	22	30	¶(23:1) A man may not marry his father’s former wife and in this way dishonor his father.
5502	5	23	1	¶A man with crushed or severed genitals may not enter the assembly of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
5503	5	23	2	A person of illegitimate birth may not enter the assembly of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; to the tenth generation no one related to him may do so.
5504	5	23	3	¶An Ammonite or Moabite may not enter the assembly of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; to the tenth generation none of their descendants shall ever do so,
5505	5	23	4	for they did not meet you with food and water on the way as you came from Egypt, and furthermore, they hired Balaam son of Beor of Pethor in Aram Naharaim to curse you.
5506	5	23	5	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God refused to listen to Balaam and changed the curse to a blessing, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God loves you.
5507	5	23	6	You must not seek peace and prosperity for them through all the ages to come.
5508	5	23	7	You must not hate an Edomite, for he is your relative; you must not hate an Egyptian, for you lived as a foreigner in his land.
5509	5	23	8	Children of the third generation born to them may enter the assembly of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
5510	5	23	9	¶When you go out as an army against your enemies, guard yourselves against anything impure.
5511	5	23	10	If there is someone among you who is impure because of some nocturnal emission, he must leave the camp; he may not reenter it immediately.
5512	5	23	11	When evening arrives he must wash himself with water and then at sunset he may reenter the camp.
5513	5	23	12	¶You are to have a place outside the camp to serve as a latrine.
5514	5	23	13	You must have a spade among your other equipment and when you relieve yourself outside you must dig a hole with the spade and then turn and cover your excrement.
5515	5	23	14	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God walks about in the middle of your camp to deliver you and defeat your enemies for you. Therefore your camp should be holy, so that he does not see anything indecent among you and turn away from you.
5516	5	23	15	¶You must not return an escaped slave to his master when he has run away to you.
5517	5	23	16	Indeed, he may live among you in any place he chooses, in whichever of your villages he prefers; you must not oppress him.
5518	5	23	17	¶There must never be a sacred prostitute among the young women of Israel nor a sacred male prostitute among the young men of Israel.
5519	5	23	18	You must never bring the pay of a female prostitute or the wage of a male prostitute into the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in fulfillment of any vow, for both of these are abhorrent to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5520	5	23	19	¶You must not charge interest on a loan to your fellow Israelite, whether on money, food, or anything else that has been loaned with interest.
5521	5	23	20	You may lend with interest to a foreigner, but not to your fellow Israelite; if you keep this command the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will bless you in all you undertake in the land you are about to enter to possess.
5522	5	23	21	When you make a vow to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God you must not delay in fulfilling it, for otherwise he will surely hold you accountable as a sinner.
5523	5	23	22	If you refrain from making a vow, it will not be sinful.
5524	5	23	23	Whatever you vow, you must be careful to do what you have promised, such as what you have vowed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God as a freewill offering.
5525	5	23	24	When you enter the vineyard of your neighbor you may eat as many grapes as you please, but you must not take away any in a container.
5526	5	23	25	When you go into the ripe grain fields of your neighbor you may pluck off the kernels with your hand, but you must not use a sickle on your neighbor’s ripe grain.
5527	5	24	1	¶If a man marries a woman and she does not please him because he has found something indecent in her, then he may draw up a divorce document, give it to her, and evict her from his house.
5528	5	24	2	When she has left him she may go and become someone else’s wife.
5529	5	24	3	If the second husband rejects her and then divorces her, gives her the papers, and evicts her from his house, or if the second husband who married her dies,
5530	5	24	4	her first husband who divorced her is not permitted to remarry her after she has become ritually impure, for that is offensive to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. You must not bring guilt on the land which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance.
5531	5	24	5	¶When a man is newly married, he need not go into the army nor be obligated in any way; he must be free to stay at home for a full year and bring joy to the wife he has married.
5532	5	24	6	¶One must not take either lower or upper millstones as security on a loan, for that is like taking a life itself as security.
5533	5	24	7	¶If a man is found kidnapping a person from among his fellow Israelites, and regards him as mere property and sells him, that kidnapper must die. In this way you will purge evil from among you.
5534	5	24	8	¶Be careful during an outbreak of leprosy to follow precisely all that the Levitical priests instruct you; as I have commanded them, so you should do.
5535	5	24	9	Remember what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God did to Miriam along the way after you left Egypt.
5536	5	24	10	¶When you make any kind of loan to your neighbor, you may not go into his house to claim what he is offering as security.
5537	5	24	11	You must stand outside and the person to whom you are making the loan will bring out to you what he is offering as security.
5538	5	24	12	If the person is poor you may not use what he gives you as security for a covering.
5539	5	24	13	You must by all means return to him at sunset the item he gave you as security so that he may sleep in his outer garment and bless you for it; it will be considered a just deed by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5540	5	24	14	¶You must not oppress a lowly and poor servant, whether one from among your fellow Israelites or from the resident foreigners who are living in your land and villages.
5541	5	24	15	You must pay his wage that very day before the sun sets, for he is poor and his life depends on it. Otherwise he will cry out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> against you, and you will be guilty of sin.
5542	5	24	16	¶Fathers must not be put to death for what their children do, nor children for what their fathers do; each must be put to death for his own sin.
5543	5	24	17	¶You must not pervert justice due a resident foreigner or an orphan, or take a widow’s garment as security for a loan.
5544	5	24	18	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God redeemed you from there; therefore I am commanding you to do all this.
5545	5	24	19	Whenever you reap your harvest in your field and leave some unraked grain there, you must not return to get it; it should go to the resident foreigner, orphan, and widow so that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God may bless all the work you do.
5546	5	24	20	When you beat your olive tree you must not repeat the procedure; the remaining olives belong to the resident foreigner, orphan, and widow.
5547	5	24	21	When you gather the grapes of your vineyard you must not do so a second time; they should go to the resident foreigner, orphan, and widow.
5548	5	24	22	Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt; therefore, I am commanding you to do all this.
5549	5	25	1	¶If controversy arises between people, they should go to court for judgment. When the judges hear the case, they shall exonerate the innocent but condemn the guilty.
5550	5	25	2	Then, if the guilty person is sentenced to a beating, the judge shall force him to lie down and be beaten in his presence with the number of blows his wicked behavior deserves.
5551	5	25	3	The judge may sentence him to forty blows, but no more. If he is struck with more than these, you might view your fellow Israelite with contempt.
5552	5	25	4	¶You must not muzzle your ox when it is treading grain.
5553	5	25	5	¶If brothers live together and one of them dies without having a son, the dead man’s wife must not remarry someone outside the family. Instead, her late husband’s brother must go to her, marry her, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law.
5554	5	25	6	Then the first son she bears will continue the name of the dead brother, thus preventing his name from being blotted out of Israel.
5555	5	25	7	But if the man does not want to marry his brother’s widow, then she must go to the elders at the town gate and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to preserve his brother’s name in Israel; he is unwilling to perform the duty of a brother-in-law to me!”
5556	5	25	8	Then the elders of his city must summon him and speak to him. If he persists, saying, “I don’t want to marry her,”
5557	5	25	9	then his sister-in-law must approach him in view of the elders, remove his sandal from his foot, and spit in his face. She will then respond, “Thus may it be done to any man who does not maintain his brother’s family line!”
5558	5	25	10	His family name will be referred to in Israel as “the family of the one whose sandal was removed.”
5559	5	25	11	¶If two men get into a hand-to-hand fight, and the wife of one of them gets involved to help her husband against his attacker, and she reaches out her hand and grabs his private parts,
5560	5	25	12	then you must cut off her hand – do not pity her.
5561	5	25	13	¶You must not have in your bag different stone weights, a heavy and a light one.
5562	5	25	14	You must not have in your house different measuring containers, a large and a small one.
5563	5	25	15	You must have an accurate and correct stone weight and an accurate and correct measuring container, so that your life may be extended in the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is about to give you.
5564	5	25	16	For anyone who acts dishonestly in these ways is abhorrent to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5565	5	25	17	¶Remember what the Amalekites did to you on your way from Egypt,
5566	5	25	18	how they met you along the way and cut off all your stragglers in the rear of the march when you were exhausted and tired; they were unafraid of God.
5567	5	25	19	So when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God gives you relief from all the enemies who surround you in the land he is giving you as an inheritance, you must wipe out the memory of the Amalekites from under heaven – do not forget!
5568	5	26	1	¶When you enter the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, and you occupy it and live in it,
5569	5	26	2	you must take the first of all the ground’s produce you harvest from the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you, place it in a basket, and go to the place where he chooses to locate his name.
5570	5	26	3	You must go to the priest in office at that time and say to him, “I declare today to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God that I have come into the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised to our ancestors to give us.”
5571	5	26	4	The priest will then take the basket from you and set it before the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5572	5	26	5	Then you must affirm before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, “A wandering Aramean was my ancestor, and he went down to Egypt and lived there as a foreigner with a household few in number, but there he became a great, powerful, and numerous people.
5573	5	26	6	But the Egyptians mistreated and oppressed us, forcing us to do burdensome labor.
5574	5	26	7	So we cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of our ancestors, and he heard us and saw our humiliation, toil, and oppression.
5575	5	26	8	Therefore the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought us out of Egypt with tremendous strength and power, as well as with great awe-inspiring signs and wonders.
5576	5	26	9	Then he brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
5577	5	26	10	So now, look! I have brought the first of the ground’s produce that you, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> have given me.” Then you must set it down before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and worship before him.
5578	5	26	11	You will celebrate all the good things that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has given you and your family, along with the Levites and the resident foreigners among you.
5579	5	26	12	¶When you finish tithing all your income in the third year (the year of tithing), you must give it to the Levites, the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows so that they may eat to their satisfaction in your villages.
5580	5	26	13	Then you shall say before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, “I have removed the sacred offering from my house and given it to the Levites, the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows just as you have commanded me. I have not violated or forgotten your commandments.
5581	5	26	14	I have not eaten anything when I was in mourning, or removed any of it while ceremonially unclean, or offered any of it to the dead; I have obeyed you and have done everything you have commanded me.
5582	5	26	15	Look down from your holy dwelling place in heaven and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us, just as you promised our ancestors – a land flowing with milk and honey.”
5583	5	26	16	¶Today the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is commanding you to keep these statutes and ordinances, something you must do with all your heart and soul.
5584	5	26	17	Today you have declared the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to be your God, and that you will walk in his ways, keep his statutes, commandments, and ordinances, and obey him.
5585	5	26	18	And today the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has declared you to be his special people (as he already promised you) so you may keep all his commandments.
5586	5	26	19	Then he will elevate you above all the nations he has made and you will receive praise, fame, and honor. You will be a people holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, as he has said.
5587	5	27	1	¶Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: “Pay attention to all the commandments I am giving you today.
5588	5	27	2	When you cross the Jordan River to the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you, you must erect great stones and cover them with plaster.
5589	5	27	3	Then you must inscribe on them all the words of this law when you cross over, so that you may enter the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, said to you.
5590	5	27	4	So when you cross the Jordan you must erect on Mount Ebal these stones about which I am commanding you today, and you must cover them with plaster.
5591	5	27	5	Then you must build an altar there to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, an altar of stones – do not use an iron tool on them.
5592	5	27	6	You must build the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God with whole stones and offer burnt offerings on it to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5593	5	27	7	Also you must offer fellowship offerings and eat them there, rejoicing before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5594	5	27	8	You must inscribe on the stones all the words of this law, making them clear.”
5595	5	27	9	¶Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel: “Be quiet and pay attention, Israel. Today you have become the people of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5596	5	27	10	You must obey him and keep his commandments and statutes that I am giving you today.”
5597	5	27	11	Moreover, Moses commanded the people that day:
5598	5	27	12	“The following tribes must stand to bless the people on Mount Gerizim when you cross the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
5599	5	27	13	And these other tribes must stand for the curse on Mount Ebal: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
5600	5	27	14	¶“The Levites will call out to every Israelite with a loud voice:
5601	5	27	15	‘Cursed is the one who makes a carved or metal image – something abhorrent to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the work of the craftsman – and sets it up in a secret place.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5602	5	27	16	‘Cursed is the one who disrespects his father and mother.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5603	5	27	17	‘Cursed is the one who moves his neighbor’s boundary marker.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5604	5	27	18	‘Cursed is the one who misleads a blind person on the road.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5605	5	27	19	‘Cursed is the one who perverts justice for the resident foreigner, the orphan, and the widow.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5606	5	27	20	‘Cursed is the one who goes to bed with his father’s former wife, for he dishonors his father.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5607	5	27	21	‘Cursed is the one who commits bestiality.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5608	5	27	22	‘Cursed is the one who goes to bed with his sister, the daughter of either his father or mother.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5609	5	27	23	‘Cursed is the one who goes to bed with his mother-in-law.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5610	5	27	24	‘Cursed is the one who kills his neighbor in private.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5611	5	27	25	‘Cursed is the one who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5612	5	27	26	‘Cursed is the one who refuses to keep the words of this law.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’
5613	5	28	1	¶“If you indeed obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and are careful to observe all his commandments I am giving you today, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will elevate you above all the nations of the earth.
5614	5	28	2	All these blessings will come to you in abundance if you obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God:
5615	5	28	3	You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the field.
5616	5	28	4	Your children will be blessed, as well as the produce of your soil, the offspring of your livestock, the calves of your herds, and the lambs of your flocks.
5617	5	28	5	Your basket and your mixing bowl will be blessed.
5618	5	28	6	You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out.
5619	5	28	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will cause your enemies who attack you to be struck down before you; they will attack you from one direction but flee from you in seven different directions.
5620	5	28	8	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will decree blessing for you with respect to your barns and in everything you do – yes, he will bless you in the land he is giving you.
5621	5	28	9	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will designate you as his holy people just as he promised you, if you keep his commandments and obey him.
5622	5	28	10	Then all the peoples of the earth will see that you belong to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> and they will respect you.
5623	5	28	11	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will greatly multiply your children, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your soil in the land which he promised your ancestors he would give you.
5624	5	28	12	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will open for you his good treasure house, the heavens, to give you rain for the land in its season and to bless all you do; you will lend to many nations but you will not borrow from any.
5625	5	28	13	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will make you the head and not the tail, and you will always end up at the top and not at the bottom, if you obey his commandments which I am urging you today to be careful to do.
5626	5	28	14	But you must not turn away from all the commandments I am giving you today, to either the right or left, nor pursue other gods and worship them.
5627	5	28	15	¶“But if you ignore the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and are not careful to keep all his commandments and statutes I am giving you today, then all these curses will come upon you in full force:
5628	5	28	16	You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the field.
5629	5	28	17	Your basket and your mixing bowl will be cursed.
5630	5	28	18	Your children will be cursed, as well as the produce of your soil, the calves of your herds, and the lambs of your flocks.
5631	5	28	19	You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.
5632	5	28	20	¶“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will send on you a curse, confusing you and opposing you in everything you undertake until you are destroyed and quickly perish because of the evil of your deeds, in that you have forsaken me.
5633	5	28	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will plague you with deadly diseases until he has completely removed you from the land you are about to possess.
5634	5	28	22	He will afflict you with weakness, fever, inflammation, infection, sword, blight, and mildew; these will attack you until you perish.
5635	5	28	23	The sky above your heads will be bronze and the earth beneath you iron.
5636	5	28	24	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will make the rain of your land powder and dust; it will come down on you from the sky until you are destroyed.
5637	5	28	25	¶“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will allow you to be struck down before your enemies; you will attack them from one direction but flee from them in seven directions and will become an object of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
5638	5	28	26	Your carcasses will be food for every bird of the sky and wild animal of the earth, and there will be no one to chase them off.
5639	5	28	27	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, eczema, and scabies, all of which cannot be healed.
5640	5	28	28	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will also subject you to madness, blindness, and confusion of mind.
5641	5	28	29	You will feel your way along at noon like the blind person does in darkness and you will not succeed in anything you do; you will be constantly oppressed and continually robbed, with no one to save you.
5642	5	28	30	You will be engaged to a woman and another man will rape her. You will build a house but not live in it. You will plant a vineyard but not even begin to use it.
5643	5	28	31	Your ox will be slaughtered before your very eyes but you will not eat of it. Your donkey will be stolen from you as you watch and will not be returned to you. Your flock of sheep will be given to your enemies and there will be no one to save you.
5644	5	28	32	Your sons and daughters will be given to another people while you look on in vain all day, and you will be powerless to do anything about it.
5645	5	28	33	As for the produce of your land and all your labor, a people you do not know will consume it, and you will be nothing but oppressed and crushed for the rest of your lives.
5646	5	28	34	You will go insane from seeing all this.
5647	5	28	35	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will afflict you in your knees and on your legs with painful, incurable boils – from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.
5648	5	28	36	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will force you and your king whom you will appoint over you to go away to a people whom you and your ancestors have not known, and you will serve other gods of wood and stone there.
5649	5	28	37	You will become an occasion of horror, a proverb, and an object of ridicule to all the peoples to whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will drive you.
5650	5	28	38	¶“You will take much seed to the field but gather little harvest, because locusts will consume it.
5651	5	28	39	You will plant vineyards and cultivate them, but you will not drink wine or gather in grapes, because worms will eat them.
5652	5	28	40	You will have olive trees throughout your territory but you will not anoint yourself with olive oil, because the olives will drop off the trees while still unripe.
5653	5	28	41	You will bear sons and daughters but not keep them, because they will be taken into captivity.
5654	5	28	42	Whirring locusts will take over every tree and all the produce of your soil.
5655	5	28	43	The resident foreigners who reside among you will become higher and higher over you and you will become lower and lower.
5656	5	28	44	They will lend to you but you will not lend to them; they will become the head and you will become the tail!
5657	5	28	45	¶All these curses will fall on you, pursuing and overtaking you until you are destroyed, because you would not obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God by keeping his commandments and statutes that he has given you.
5658	5	28	46	These curses will be a perpetual sign and wonder with reference to you and your descendants.
5659	5	28	47	¶“Because you have not served the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God joyfully and wholeheartedly with the abundance of everything you have,
5660	5	28	48	instead in hunger, thirst, nakedness, and poverty you will serve your enemies whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will send against you. They will place an iron yoke on your neck until they have destroyed you.
5661	5	28	49	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will raise up a distant nation against you, one from the other side of the earth as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you will not understand,
5662	5	28	50	a nation of stern appearance that will have no regard for the elderly or pity for the young.
5663	5	28	51	They will devour the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your soil until you are destroyed. They will not leave you with any grain, new wine, olive oil, calves of your herds, or lambs of your flocks until they have destroyed you.
5664	5	28	52	They will besiege all of your villages until all of your high and fortified walls collapse – those in which you put your confidence throughout the land. They will besiege all your villages throughout the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has given you.
5665	5	28	53	You will then eat your own offspring, the flesh of the sons and daughters the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has given you, because of the severity of the siege by which your enemies will constrict you.
5666	5	28	54	The man among you who is by nature tender and sensitive will turn against his brother, his beloved wife, and his remaining children.
5667	5	28	55	He will withhold from all of them his children’s flesh that he is eating (since there is nothing else left), because of the severity of the siege by which your enemy will constrict you in your villages.
5668	5	28	56	Likewise, the most tender and delicate of your women, who would never think of putting even the sole of her foot on the ground because of her daintiness, will turn against her beloved husband, her sons and daughters,
5669	5	28	57	and will secretly eat her afterbirth and her newborn children (since she has nothing else), because of the severity of the siege by which your enemy will constrict you in your villages.
5670	5	28	58	¶“If you refuse to obey all the words of this law, the things written in this scroll, and refuse to fear this glorious and awesome name, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,
5671	5	28	59	then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will increase your punishments and those of your descendants – great and long-lasting afflictions and severe, enduring illnesses.
5672	5	28	60	He will infect you with all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will persistently afflict you.
5673	5	28	61	Moreover, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will bring upon you every kind of sickness and plague not mentioned in this scroll of commandments, until you have perished.
5674	5	28	62	There will be very few of you left, though at one time you were as numerous as the stars in the sky, because you will have disobeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
5675	5	28	63	This is what will happen: Just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> delighted to do good for you and make you numerous, he will take delight in destroying and decimating you. You will be uprooted from the land you are about to possess.
5676	5	28	64	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, gods of wood and stone.
5677	5	28	65	Among those nations you will have no rest nor will there be a place of peaceful rest for the soles of your feet, for there the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will give you an anxious heart, failing eyesight, and a spirit of despair.
5678	5	28	66	Your life will hang in doubt before you; you will be terrified by night and day and will have no certainty of surviving from one day to the next.
5679	5	28	67	In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were evening!’ And in the evening you will say, ‘I wish it were morning!’ because of the things you will fear and the things you will see.
5680	5	28	68	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will make you return to Egypt by ship, over a route I said to you that you would never see again. There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.”
5681	5	29	1	¶(28:69) These are the words of the covenant that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded Moses to make with the people of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb.
5682	5	29	2	¶Moses proclaimed to all Israel as follows: “You have seen all that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, all his servants, and his land.
5683	5	29	3	Your eyes have seen the great judgments, those signs and mighty wonders.
5684	5	29	4	But to this very day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not given you an understanding mind, perceptive eyes, or discerning ears!
5685	5	29	5	I have led you through the wilderness for forty years. Your clothing has not worn out nor have your sandals deteriorated.
5686	5	29	6	You have eaten no bread and drunk no wine or beer – all so that you might know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God!
5687	5	29	7	When you came to this place King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out to make war and we defeated them.
5688	5	29	8	Then we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh.
5689	5	29	9	¶“Therefore, keep the terms of this covenant and obey them so that you may be successful in everything you do.
5690	5	29	10	You are standing today, all of you, before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God – the heads of your tribes, your elders, your officials, every Israelite man,
5691	5	29	11	your infants, your wives, and the resident foreigners living in your encampment, those who chop wood and those who carry water –
5692	5	29	12	so that you may enter by oath into the covenant the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is making with you today.
5693	5	29	13	Today he will affirm that you are his people and that he is your God, just as he promised you and as he swore by oath to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
5694	5	29	14	It is not with you alone that I am making this covenant by oath,
5695	5	29	15	but with whoever stands with us here today before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God as well as those not with us here today.
5696	5	29	16	¶“(For you know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we crossed through the nations as we traveled.
5697	5	29	17	You have seen their detestable things and idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold.)
5698	5	29	18	Beware that the heart of no man, woman, clan, or tribe among you turns away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God today to pursue and serve the gods of those nations; beware that there is among you no root producing poisonous and bitter fruit.
5699	5	29	19	When such a person hears the words of this oath he secretly blesses himself and says, “I will have peace though I continue to walk with a stubborn spirit.” This will destroy the watered ground with the parched.
5700	5	29	20	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be unwilling to forgive him, and his intense anger will rage against that man; all the curses written in this scroll will fall upon him and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will obliterate his name from memory.
5701	5	29	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will single him out for judgment from all the tribes of Israel according to all the curses of the covenant written in this scroll of the law.
5702	5	29	22	The generation to come – your descendants who will rise up after you, as well as the foreigner who will come from distant places – will see the afflictions of that land and the illnesses that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has brought on it.
5703	5	29	23	The whole land will be covered with brimstone, salt, and burning debris; it will not be planted nor will it sprout or produce grass. It will resemble the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> destroyed in his intense anger.
5704	5	29	24	Then all the nations will ask, “Why has the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> done all this to this land? What is this fierce, heated display of anger all about?”
5705	5	29	25	Then people will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
5706	5	29	26	They went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods they did not know and that he did not permit them to worship.
5707	5	29	27	That is why the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anger erupted against this land, bringing on it all the curses written in this scroll.
5708	5	29	28	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has uprooted them from their land in anger, wrath, and great rage and has deported them to another land, as is clear today.”
5709	5	29	29	Secret things belong to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, but those that are revealed belong to us and our descendants forever, so that we might obey all the words of this law.
5710	5	30	1	¶“When you have experienced all these things, both the blessings and the curses I have set before you, you will reflect upon them in all the nations where the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has banished you.
5711	5	30	2	Then if you and your descendants turn to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and obey him with your whole mind and being just as I am commanding you today,
5712	5	30	3	the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will reverse your captivity and have pity on you. He will turn and gather you from all the peoples among whom he has scattered you.
5713	5	30	4	Even if your exiles are in the most distant land, from there the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will gather you and bring you back.
5714	5	30	5	Then he will bring you to the land your ancestors possessed and you also will possess it; he will do better for you and multiply you more than he did your ancestors.
5715	5	30	6	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will also cleanse your heart and the hearts of your descendants so that you may love him with all your mind and being and so that you may live.
5716	5	30	7	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will put all these curses on your enemies, on those who hate you and persecute you.
5717	5	30	8	You will return and obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, keeping all his commandments I am giving you today.
5718	5	30	9	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will make the labor of your hands abundantly successful and multiply your children, the offspring of your cattle, and the produce of your soil. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will once more rejoice over you to make you prosperous just as he rejoiced over your ancestors,
5719	5	30	10	if you obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and keep his commandments and statutes that are written in this scroll of the law. But you must turn to him with your whole mind and being.
5720	5	30	11	¶“This commandment I am giving you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it too remote.
5721	5	30	12	It is not in heaven, as though one must say, “Who will go up to heaven to get it for us and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?”
5722	5	30	13	And it is not across the sea, as though one must say, “Who will cross over to the other side of the sea and get it for us and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?”
5723	5	30	14	For the thing is very near you – it is in your mouth and in your mind so that you can do it.
5724	5	30	15	¶“Look ! I have set before you today life and prosperity on the one hand, and death and disaster on the other.
5725	5	30	16	What I am commanding you today is to love the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, to walk in his ways, and to obey his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances. Then you will live and become numerous and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will bless you in the land which you are about to possess.
5726	5	30	17	However, if you turn aside and do not obey, but are lured away to worship and serve other gods,
5727	5	30	18	I declare to you this very day that you will certainly perish! You will not extend your time in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
5728	5	30	19	Today I invoke heaven and earth as a witness against you that I have set life and death, blessing and curse, before you. Therefore choose life so that you and your descendants may live!
5729	5	30	20	I also call on you to love the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, to obey him and be loyal to him, for he gives you life and enables you to live continually in the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
5730	5	31	1	¶Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
5731	5	31	2	He said to them, “Today I am a hundred and twenty years old. I am no longer able to get about, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said to me, ‘You will not cross the Jordan.’
5732	5	31	3	As for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, he is about to cross over before you; he will destroy these nations before you and you will dispossess them. As for Joshua, he is about to cross before you just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said.
5733	5	31	4	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will do to them just what he did to Sihon and Og, the Amorite kings, and to their land, which he destroyed.
5734	5	31	5	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will deliver them over to you and you will do to them according to the whole commandment I have given you.
5735	5	31	6	Be strong and courageous! Do not fear or tremble before them, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is the one who is going with you. He will not fail you or abandon you!”
5736	5	31	7	Then Moses called out to Joshua in the presence of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you will accompany these people to the land that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised to give their ancestors, and you will enable them to inherit it.
5737	5	31	8	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is indeed going before you – he will be with you; he will not fail you or abandon you. Do not be afraid or discouraged!”
5738	5	31	9	¶Then Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the Levitical priests, who carry the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant, and to all Israel’s elders.
5739	5	31	10	He commanded them: “At the end of seven years, at the appointed time of the cancellation of debts, at the Feast of Shelters,
5740	5	31	11	when all Israel comes to appear before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in the place he chooses, you must read this law before them within their hearing.
5741	5	31	12	Gather the people – men, women, and children, as well as the resident foreigners in your villages – so they may hear and thus learn about and fear the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and carefully obey all the words of this law.
5742	5	31	13	Then their children, who have not known this law, will also hear about and learn to fear the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God for as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
5743	5	31	14	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “The day of your death is near. Summon Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting so that I can commission him.” So Moses and Joshua presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
5744	5	31	15	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud that stood above the door of the tent.
5745	5	31	16	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, “You are about to die, and then these people will begin to prostitute themselves with the foreign gods of the land into which they are going. They will reject me and break my covenant that I have made with them.
5746	5	31	17	At that time my anger will erupt against them and I will abandon them and hide my face from them until they are devoured. Many disasters and distresses will overcome them so that they will say at that time, ‘Have not these disasters overcome us because our God is not among us ?’
5747	5	31	18	But I will certainly hide myself at that time because of all the wickedness they will have done by turning to other gods.
5748	5	31	19	Now write down for yourselves the following song and teach it to the Israelites. Put it into their very mouths so that this song may serve as my witness against the Israelites!
5749	5	31	20	For after I have brought them to the land I promised to their ancestors – one flowing with milk and honey – and they eat their fill and become fat, then they will turn to other gods and worship them; they will reject me and break my covenant.
5750	5	31	21	Then when many disasters and distresses overcome them this song will testify against them, for their descendants will not forget it. I know the intentions they have in mind today, even before I bring them to the land I have promised.”
5751	5	31	22	So on that day Moses wrote down this song and taught it to the Israelites,
5752	5	31	23	and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commissioned Joshua son of Nun, “Be strong and courageous, for you will take the Israelites to the land I have promised them, and I will be with you.”
5753	5	31	24	¶When Moses finished writing on a scroll the words of this law in their entirety,
5754	5	31	25	he commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant,
5755	5	31	26	“Take this scroll of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. It will remain there as a witness against you,
5756	5	31	27	for I know about your rebellion and stubbornness. Indeed, even while I have been living among you to this very day, you have rebelled against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; you will be even more rebellious after my death!
5757	5	31	28	Gather to me all your tribal elders and officials so I can speak to them directly about these things and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them.
5758	5	31	29	For I know that after I die you will totally corrupt yourselves and turn away from the path I have commanded you to walk. Disaster will confront you in the days to come because you will act wickedly before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, inciting him to anger because of your actions.”
5759	5	31	30	Then Moses recited the words of this song from start to finish in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel.
5760	5	32	1	‡Listen, O heavens, and I will speak;‡hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
5761	5	32	2	‡My teaching will drop like the rain,‡my sayings will drip like the dew, ‡as rain drops upon the grass,‡and showers upon new growth.
5762	5	32	3	‡For I will proclaim the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡you must acknowledge the greatness of our God.
5763	5	32	4	‡As for the Rock, his work is perfect,‡for all his ways are just.‡He is a reliable God who is never unjust,‡he is fair and upright.
5764	5	32	5	‡His people have been unfaithful to him;‡they have not acted like his children – this is their sin. ‡They are a perverse and deceitful generation.
5765	5	32	6	‡Is this how you repay the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡you foolish, unwise people?‡Is he not your father, your Creator?‡He has made you and established you.
5766	5	32	7	‡Remember the ancient days;‡bear in mind the years of past generations. ‡Ask your father and he will inform you,‡your elders, and they will tell you.
5767	5	32	8	‡When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,‡when he divided up humankind, ‡he set the boundaries of the peoples,‡according to the number of the heavenly assembly.
5768	5	32	9	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s allotment is his people,‡Jacob is his special possession.
5769	5	32	10	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> found him in a desolate land, ‡in an empty wasteland where animals howl. ‡He continually guarded him and taught him; ‡he continually protected him like the pupil of his eye.
5770	5	32	11	‡Like an eagle that stirs up its nest,‡that hovers over its young,‡so the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spread out his wings and took him, ‡he lifted him up on his pinions.
5771	5	32	12	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> alone was guiding him, ‡no foreign god was with him.
5772	5	32	13	‡He enabled him to travel over the high terrain of the land,‡and he ate of the produce of the fields.‡He provided honey for him from the cliffs, ‡and olive oil from the hardest of rocks,
5773	5	32	14	‡butter from the herd‡and milk from the flock,‡along with the fat of lambs,‡rams and goats of Bashan,‡along with the best of the kernels of wheat;‡and from the juice of grapes you drank wine.
5774	5	32	15	‡But Jeshurun became fat and kicked,‡you got fat, thick, and stuffed!‡Then he deserted the God who made him,‡and treated the Rock who saved him with contempt.
5775	5	32	16	‡They made him jealous with other gods, ‡they enraged him with abhorrent idols.
5776	5	32	17	‡They sacrificed to demons, not God,‡to gods they had not known;‡to new gods who had recently come along,‡gods your ancestors had not known about.
5777	5	32	18	‡You have forgotten the Rock who fathered you,‡and put out of mind the God who gave you birth.
5778	5	32	19	‡But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> took note and despised them‡because his sons and daughters enraged him.
5779	5	32	20	‡He said, “I will reject them, ‡I will see what will happen to them;‡for they are a perverse generation,‡children who show no loyalty.
5780	5	32	21	‡They have made me jealous with false gods, ‡enraging me with their worthless gods; ‡so I will make them jealous with a people they do not recognize, ‡with a nation slow to learn I will enrage them.
5781	5	32	22	‡For a fire has been kindled by my anger,‡and it burns to lowest Sheol; ‡it consumes the earth and its produce,‡and ignites the foundations of the mountains.
5782	5	32	23	‡I will increase their disasters,‡I will use up my arrows on them.
5783	5	32	24	‡They will be starved by famine,‡eaten by plague, and bitterly stung; ‡I will send the teeth of wild animals against them,‡along with the poison of creatures that crawl in the dust.
5784	5	32	25	‡The sword will make people childless outside,‡and terror will do so inside;‡they will destroy both the young man and the virgin,‡the infant and the gray-haired man.
5785	5	32	26	‡“I said, ‘I want to cut them in pieces. ‡I want to make people forget they ever existed.
5786	5	32	27	‡But I fear the reaction of their enemies,‡for their adversaries would misunderstand‡and say, “Our power is great, ‡and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not done all this!”’
5787	5	32	28	‡They are a nation devoid of wisdom, ‡and there is no understanding among them.
5788	5	32	29	‡I wish that they were wise and could understand this,‡and that they could comprehend what will happen to them.”
5789	5	32	30	‡How can one man chase a thousand of them, ‡and two pursue ten thousand;‡unless their Rock had delivered them up, ‡and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had handed them over?
5790	5	32	31	‡For our enemies’ rock is not like our Rock,‡as even our enemies concede.
5791	5	32	32	‡For their vine is from the stock of Sodom,‡and from the fields of Gomorrah. ‡Their grapes contain venom, ‡their clusters of grapes are bitter.
5792	5	32	33	‡Their wine is snakes’ poison,‡the deadly venom of cobras.
5793	5	32	34	‡“Is this not stored up with me?” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡“Is it not sealed up in my storehouses?
5794	5	32	35	‡I will get revenge and pay them back‡at the time their foot slips;‡for the day of their disaster is near,‡and the impending judgment is rushing upon them!”
5795	5	32	36	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will judge his people,‡and will change his plans concerning his servants;‡when he sees that their power has disappeared,‡and that no one is left, whether confined or set free.
5796	5	32	37	‡He will say, “Where are their gods,‡the rock in whom they sought security,
5797	5	32	38	‡who ate the best of their sacrifices,‡and drank the wine of their drink offerings?‡Let them rise and help you;‡let them be your refuge!
5798	5	32	39	‡“See now that I, indeed I, am he!” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡“and there is no other god besides me.‡I kill and give life,‡I smash and I heal,‡and none can resist my power.
5799	5	32	40	‡For I raise up my hand to heaven,‡and say, ‘As surely as I live forever,
5800	5	32	41	‡I will sharpen my lightning-like sword,‡and my hand will grasp hold of the weapon of judgment; ‡I will execute vengeance on my foes,‡and repay those who hate me!
5801	5	32	42	‡I will make my arrows drunk with blood, ‡and my sword will devour flesh – ‡the blood of the slaughtered and captured,‡the chief of the enemy’s leaders!’”
5802	5	32	43	‡Cry out, O nations, with his people,‡for he will avenge his servants’ blood;‡he will take vengeance against his enemies,‡and make atonement for his land and people.
5803	5	32	44	¶Then Moses went with Joshua son of Nun and recited all the words of this song to the people.
5804	5	32	45	When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel
5805	5	32	46	he said to them, “Keep in mind all the words I am solemnly proclaiming to you today; you must command your children to observe carefully all the words of this law.
5806	5	32	47	For this is no idle word for you – it is your life! By this word you will live a long time in the land you are about to cross the Jordan to possess.”
5807	5	32	48	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Moses that same day,
5808	5	32	49	“Go up to this Abarim hill country, to Mount Nebo (which is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho) and look at the land of Canaan that I am giving to the Israelites as a possession.
5809	5	32	50	You will die on the mountain that you ascend and join your deceased ancestors, just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and joined his deceased ancestors,
5810	5	32	51	for both of you rebelled against me among the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin when you did not show me proper respect among the Israelites.
5811	5	32	52	You will see the land before you, but you will not enter the land that I am giving to the Israelites.”
5812	5	33	1	¶This is the blessing Moses the man of God pronounced upon the Israelites before his death.
5813	5	33	2	He said:‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came from Sinai‡and revealed himself to Israel from Seir.‡He appeared in splendor from Mount Paran,‡and came forth with ten thousand holy ones. ‡With his right hand he gave a fiery law to them.
5814	5	33	3	‡Surely he loves the people; ‡all your holy ones are in your power. ‡And they sit at your feet,‡each receiving your words.
5815	5	33	4	‡Moses delivered to us a law, ‡an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
5816	5	33	5	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was king over Jeshurun, ‡when the leaders of the people assembled,‡the tribes of Israel together.
5817	5	33	6	‡May Reuben live and not die,‡and may his people multiply.
5818	5	33	7	‡And this is the blessing to Judah. He said,‡Listen, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, to Judah’s voice,‡and bring him to his people.‡May his power be great,‡and may you help him against his foes.
5819	5	33	8	‡Of Levi he said:‡Your Thummim and Urim belong to your godly one, ‡whose authority you challenged at Massah, ‡and with whom you argued at the waters of Meribah.
5820	5	33	9	‡He said to his father and mother, “I have not seen him,” ‡and he did not acknowledge his own brothers‡or know his own children,‡for they kept your word,‡and guarded your covenant.
5821	5	33	10	‡They will teach Jacob your ordinances‡and Israel your law;‡they will offer incense as a pleasant odor, ‡and a whole offering on your altar.
5822	5	33	11	‡Bless, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, his goods,‡and be pleased with his efforts;‡undercut the legs of any who attack him,‡and of those who hate him, so that they cannot stand.
5823	5	33	12	‡Of Benjamin he said:‡The beloved of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will live safely by him;‡he protects him all the time, ‡and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> places him on his chest.
5824	5	33	13	‡Of Joseph he said:‡May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> bless his land‡with the harvest produced by the sky, by the dew,‡and by the depths crouching beneath;
5825	5	33	14	‡with the harvest produced by the daylight ‡and by the moonlight;
5826	5	33	15	‡with the best of the ancient mountains‡and the harvest produced by the age-old hills;
5827	5	33	16	‡with the harvest of the earth and its fullness‡and the pleasure of him who resided in the burning bush. ‡May blessing rest on Joseph’s head,‡and on the top of the head of the one set apart from his brothers.
5828	5	33	17	‡May the firstborn of his bull bring him honor,‡and may his horns be those of a wild ox;‡with them may he gore all peoples,‡all the far reaches of the earth.‡They are the ten thousands of Ephraim, ‡and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
5829	5	33	18	‡Of Zebulun he said:‡Rejoice, Zebulun, when you go outside, ‡and Issachar, when you are in your tents.
5830	5	33	19	‡They will summon peoples to the mountain,‡there they will sacrifice proper sacrifices;‡for they will enjoy the abundance of the seas,‡and the hidden treasures of the shores.
5831	5	33	20	‡Of Gad he said:‡Blessed be the one who enlarges Gad.‡Like a lioness he will dwell;‡he will tear at an arm – indeed, a scalp.
5832	5	33	21	‡He has selected the best part for himself,‡for the portion of the ruler is set aside there;‡he came with the leaders of the people,‡he obeyed the righteous laws of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡and his ordinances with Israel.
5833	5	33	22	‡Of Dan he said:‡Dan is a lion’s cub;‡he will leap forth from Bashan.
5834	5	33	23	‡Of Naphtali he said:‡O Naphtali, overflowing with favor,‡and full of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s blessing,‡possess the west and south.
5835	5	33	24	‡Of Asher he said:‡Asher is blessed with children,‡may he be favored by his brothers‡and may he dip his foot in olive oil.
5836	5	33	25	‡The bars of your gates will be made of iron and bronze,‡and may you have lifelong strength.
5837	5	33	26	‡There is no one like God, O Jeshurun, ‡who rides through the sky to help you, ‡on the clouds in majesty.
5838	5	33	27	‡The everlasting God is a refuge, ‡and underneath you are his eternal arms; ‡he has driven out enemies before you,‡and has said, “Destroy!”
5839	5	33	28	‡Israel lives in safety,‡the fountain of Jacob is quite secure, ‡in a land of grain and new wine;‡indeed, its heavens rain down dew.
5840	5	33	29	‡You have joy, Israel! Who is like you?‡You are a people delivered by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡your protective shield‡and your exalted sword.‡May your enemies cringe before you;‡may you trample on their backs.
5841	5	34	1	¶Then Moses ascended from the rift valley plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the summit of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> showed him the whole land – Gilead to Dan,
5842	5	34	2	and all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the distant sea,
5843	5	34	3	the Negev, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of date palm trees, as far as Zoar.
5844	5	34	4	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “This is the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it, but you will not cross over there.”
5845	5	34	5	¶So Moses, the servant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, died there in the land of Moab as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had said.
5846	5	34	6	He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab near Beth Peor, but no one knows his exact burial place to this very day.
5847	5	34	7	Moses was 120 years old when he died, but his eye was not dull nor had his vitality departed.
5848	5	34	8	The Israelites mourned for Moses in the rift valley plains of Moab for thirty days; then the days of mourning for Moses ended.
5849	5	34	9	¶Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had placed his hands on him; and the Israelites listened to him and did just what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.
5850	5	34	10	No prophet ever again arose in Israel like Moses, who knew the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> face to face.
5851	5	34	11	He did all the signs and wonders the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, all his servants, and the whole land,
5852	5	34	12	and he displayed great power and awesome might in view of all Israel.
5853	6	1	1	¶After Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant died, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant:
5854	6	1	2	“Moses my servant is dead. Get ready! Cross the Jordan River! Lead these people into the land which I am ready to hand over to them.
5855	6	1	3	I am handing over to you every place you set foot, as I promised Moses.
5856	6	1	4	Your territory will extend from the desert in the south to Lebanon in the north. It will extend all the way to the great River Euphrates in the east (including all of Syria) and all the way to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.
5857	6	1	5	No one will be able to resist you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not abandon you or leave you alone.
5858	6	1	6	Be strong and brave! You must lead these people in the conquest of this land that I solemnly promised their ancestors I would hand over to them.
5859	6	1	7	Make sure you are very strong and brave! Carefully obey all the law my servant Moses charged you to keep! Do not swerve from it to the right or to the left, so that you may be successful in all you do.
5860	6	1	8	This law scroll must not leave your lips! You must memorize it day and night so you can carefully obey all that is written in it. Then you will prosper and be successful.
5861	6	1	9	I repeat, be strong and brave! Don’t be afraid and don’t panic, for I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, am with you in all you do.”
5862	6	1	10	¶Joshua instructed the leaders of the people:
5863	6	1	11	“Go through the camp and command the people, ‘Prepare your supplies, for within three days you will cross the Jordan River and begin the conquest of the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is ready to hand over to you.’”
5864	6	1	12	¶Joshua told the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh:
5865	6	1	13	“Remember what Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant commanded you. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you a place to settle and is handing this land over to you.
5866	6	1	14	Your wives, children and cattle may stay in the land that Moses assigned to you east of the Jordan River. But all you warriors must cross over armed for battle ahead of your brothers. You must help them
5867	6	1	15	until the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gives your brothers a place like yours to settle and they conquer the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is ready to hand over to them. Then you may go back to your allotted land and occupy the land Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant assigned you east of the Jordan.”
5868	6	1	16	¶They told Joshua, “We will do everything you say. We will go wherever you send us.
5869	6	1	17	Just as we obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. But may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God be with you as he was with Moses!
5870	6	1	18	Any man who rebels against what you say and does not obey all your commands will be executed. But be strong and brave!”
5871	6	2	1	¶Joshua son of Nun sent two spies out from Shittim secretly and instructed them: “Find out what you can about the land, especially Jericho.” They stopped at the house of a prostitute named Rahab and spent the night there.
5872	6	2	2	The king of Jericho received this report: “Note well! Israelite men have come here tonight to spy on the land.”
5873	6	2	3	So the king of Jericho sent this order to Rahab: “Turn over the men who came to you – the ones who came to your house – for they have come to spy on the whole land!”
5874	6	2	4	But the woman hid the two men and replied, “Yes, these men were clients of mine, but I didn’t know where they came from.
5875	6	2	5	When it was time to shut the city gate for the night, the men left. I don’t know where they were heading. Chase after them quickly, for you have time to catch them!”
5876	6	2	6	(Now she had taken them up to the roof and had hidden them in the stalks of flax she had spread out on the roof.)
5877	6	2	7	Meanwhile the king’s men tried to find them on the road to the Jordan River near the fords. The city gate was shut as soon as they set out in pursuit of them.
5878	6	2	8	¶Now before the spies went to sleep, Rahab went up to the roof.
5879	6	2	9	She said to the men, “I know the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is handing this land over to you. We are absolutely terrified of you, and all who live in the land are cringing before you.
5880	6	2	10	For we heard how the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you left Egypt and how you annihilated the two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og, on the other side of the Jordan.
5881	6	2	11	When we heard the news we lost our courage and no one could even breathe for fear of you. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is God in heaven above and on earth below!
5882	6	2	12	So now, promise me this with an oath sworn in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s name. Because I have shown allegiance to you, show allegiance to my family. Give me a solemn pledge
5883	6	2	13	that you will spare the lives of my father, mother, brothers, sisters, and all who belong to them, and rescue us from death.”
5884	6	2	14	The men said to her, “If you die, may we die too! If you do not report what we’ve been up to, then, when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hands the land over to us, we will show unswerving allegiance to you.”
5885	6	2	15	¶Then Rahab let them down by a rope through the window. (Her house was built as part of the city wall; she lived in the wall.)
5886	6	2	16	She told them, “Head to the hill country, so the ones chasing you don’t find you. Hide from them there for three days, long enough for those chasing you to return. Then you can be on your way.”
5887	6	2	17	The men said to her, “We are not bound by this oath you made us swear unless the following conditions are met:
5888	6	2	18	When we invade the land , tie this red rope in the window through which you let us down, and gather together in your house your father, mother, brothers, and all who live in your father’s house.
5889	6	2	19	Anyone who leaves your house will be responsible for his own death – we are innocent in that case! But if anyone with you in the house is harmed, we will be responsible.
5890	6	2	20	If you should report what we’ve been up to, we are not bound by this oath you made us swear.”
5891	6	2	21	She said, “I agree to these conditions.” She sent them on their way and then tied the red rope in the window.
5892	6	2	22	They went to the hill country and stayed there for three days, long enough for those chasing them to return. Their pursuers looked all along the way but did not find them.
5893	6	2	23	Then the two men returned – they came down from the hills, crossed the river, came to Joshua son of Nun, and reported to him all they had discovered.
5894	6	2	24	They told Joshua, “Surely the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is handing over all the land to us! All who live in the land are cringing before us!”
5895	6	3	1	¶Bright and early the next morning Joshua and the Israelites left Shittim and came to the Jordan. They camped there before crossing the river.
5896	6	3	2	After three days the leaders went through the camp
5897	6	3	3	and commanded the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God being carried by the Levitical priests, you must leave here and walk behind it.
5898	6	3	4	But stay about three thousand feet behind it. Keep your distance so you can see which way you should go, for you have not traveled this way before.”
5899	6	3	5	¶Joshua told the people, “Ritually consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will perform miraculous deeds among you.”
5900	6	3	6	Joshua told the priests, “Pick up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people.” So they picked up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.
5901	6	3	7	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Joshua, “This very day I will begin to honor you before all Israel so they will know that I am with you just as I was with Moses.
5902	6	3	8	Instruct the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, ‘When you reach the bank of the Jordan River, wade into the water.’”
5903	6	3	9	¶Joshua told the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God!”
5904	6	3	10	Joshua continued, “This is how you will know the living God is among you and that he will truly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.
5905	6	3	11	Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth is ready to enter the Jordan ahead of you.
5906	6	3	12	Now select for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one per tribe.
5907	6	3	13	When the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the Lord of the whole earth, touch the water of the Jordan, the water coming downstream toward you will stop flowing and pile up.”
5908	6	3	14	¶So when the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.
5909	6	3	15	When the ones carrying the ark reached the Jordan and the feet of the priests carrying the ark touched the surface of the water – (the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest time) –
5910	6	3	16	the water coming downstream toward them stopped flowing. It piled up far upstream at Adam (the city near Zarethan); there was no water at all flowing to the sea of the rift valley (the Salt Sea). The people crossed the river opposite Jericho.
5911	6	3	17	The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan. All Israel crossed over on dry ground until the entire nation was on the other side.
5912	6	4	1	¶When the entire nation was on the other side, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Joshua,
5913	6	4	2	“Select for yourselves twelve men from the people, one per tribe.
5914	6	4	3	Instruct them, ‘Pick up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests stand firmly, and carry them over with you and put them in the place where you camp tonight.’”
5915	6	4	4	¶Joshua summoned the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one per tribe.
5916	6	4	5	Joshua told them, “Go in front of the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God to the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to put a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the Israelite tribes.
5917	6	4	6	The stones will be a reminder to you. When your children ask someday, ‘Why are these stones important to you?’
5918	6	4	7	tell them how the water of the Jordan stopped flowing before the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. When it crossed the Jordan, the water of the Jordan stopped flowing. These stones will be a lasting memorial for the Israelites.”
5919	6	4	8	¶The Israelites did just as Joshua commanded. They picked up twelve stones, according to the number of the Israelite tribes, from the middle of the Jordan as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had instructed Joshua. They carried them over with them to the camp and put them there.
5920	6	4	9	Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan in the very place where the priests carrying the ark of the covenant stood. They remain there to this very day.
5921	6	4	10	¶Now the priests carrying the ark of the covenant were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the Lord had commanded Joshua to tell the people was accomplished, in accordance with all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people went across quickly,
5922	6	4	11	and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and the priests crossed as the people looked on.
5923	6	4	12	The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed for battle ahead of the Israelites, just as Moses had instructed them.
5924	6	4	13	About forty thousand battle-ready troops marched past the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to fight on the rift valley plains of Jericho.
5925	6	4	14	That day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought honor to Joshua before all Israel. They respected him all his life, just as they had respected Moses.
5926	6	4	15	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Joshua,
5927	6	4	16	“Instruct the priests carrying the ark of the covenantal laws to come up from the Jordan.”
5928	6	4	17	So Joshua instructed the priests, “Come up from the Jordan!”
5929	6	4	18	The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came up from the middle of the Jordan, and as soon as they set foot on dry land, the water of the Jordan flowed again and returned to flood stage.
5930	6	4	19	¶The people went up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped in Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
5931	6	4	20	Now Joshua set up in Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan.
5932	6	4	21	He told the Israelites, “When your children someday ask their fathers, ‘What do these stones represent?’
5933	6	4	22	explain to your children, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry ground.’
5934	6	4	23	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God dried up the water of the Jordan before you while you crossed over. It was just like when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God dried up the Red Sea before us while we crossed it.
5935	6	4	24	He has done this so all the nations of the earth might recognize the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s power and so you might always obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.”
5936	6	5	1	¶When all the Amorite kings on the west side of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the seacoast heard how the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had dried up the water of the Jordan before the Israelites while they crossed, they lost their courage and could not even breathe for fear of the Israelites.
5937	6	5	2	¶At that time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites once again.”
5938	6	5	3	So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites on the Hill of the Foreskins.
5939	6	5	4	This is why Joshua had to circumcise them: All the men old enough to fight when they left Egypt died on the journey through the wilderness after they left Egypt.
5940	6	5	5	Now all the men who left were circumcised, but all the sons born on the journey through the wilderness after they left Egypt were uncircumcised.
5941	6	5	6	Indeed, for forty years the Israelites traveled through the wilderness until all the men old enough to fight when they left Egypt, the ones who had disobeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, died off. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had sworn a solemn oath to them that he would not let them see the land he had sworn by oath to their ancestors to give them, a land rich in milk and honey.
5942	6	5	7	He replaced them with their sons, whom Joshua circumcised. They were uncircumcised; their fathers had not circumcised them along the way.
5943	6	5	8	When all the men had been circumcised, they stayed there in the camp until they had healed.
5944	6	5	9	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Joshua, “Today I have taken away the disgrace of Egypt from you.” So that place is called Gilgal even to this day.
5945	6	5	10	¶So the Israelites camped in Gilgal and celebrated the Passover in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month in the rift valley plains of Jericho.
5946	6	5	11	They ate some of the produce of the land the day after the Passover, including unleavened bread and roasted grain.
5947	6	5	12	The manna stopped appearing the day they ate some of the produce of the land; the Israelites never ate manna again. They ate from the produce of the land of Canaan that year.
5948	6	5	13	¶When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him holding a drawn sword. Joshua approached him and asked him, “Are you on our side or allied with our enemies?”
5949	6	5	14	He answered, “Truly I am the commander of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s army. Now I have arrived!” Joshua bowed down with his face to the ground and asked, “What does my master want to say to his servant?”
5950	6	5	15	The commander of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s army answered Joshua, “Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you stand is holy.” Joshua did so.
5951	6	6	1	¶Now Jericho was shut tightly because of the Israelites. No one was allowed to leave or enter.
5952	6	6	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Joshua, “See, I am about to defeat Jericho for you, along with its king and its warriors.
5953	6	6	3	Have all the warriors march around the city one time; do this for six days.
5954	6	6	4	Have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the horns.
5955	6	6	5	When you hear the signal from the ram’s horn, have the whole army give a loud battle cry. Then the city wall will collapse and the warriors should charge straight ahead.”
5956	6	6	6	¶So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and instructed them, “Pick up the ark of the covenant, and seven priests must carry seven rams’ horns in front of the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
5957	6	6	7	And he told the army, “Move ahead and march around the city, with armed troops going ahead of the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
5958	6	6	8	¶When Joshua gave the army its orders, the seven priests carrying the seven rams’ horns before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> moved ahead and blew the horns as the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> followed behind.
5959	6	6	9	Armed troops marched ahead of the priests blowing the horns, while the rear guard followed along behind the ark blowing rams’ horns.
5960	6	6	10	Now Joshua had instructed the army, “Do not give a battle cry or raise your voices; say nothing until the day I tell you, ‘Give the battle cry.’ Then give the battle cry!”
5961	6	6	11	So Joshua made sure they marched the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> around the city one time. Then they went back to the camp and spent the night there.
5962	6	6	12	¶Bright and early the next morning Joshua had the priests pick up the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
5963	6	6	13	The seven priests carrying the seven rams’ horns before the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> marched along blowing their horns. Armed troops marched ahead of them, while the rear guard followed along behind the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> blowing rams’ horns.
5964	6	6	14	They marched around the city one time on the second day, then returned to the camp. They did this six days in all.
5965	6	6	15	¶On the seventh day they were up at the crack of dawn and marched around the city as before – only this time they marched around it seven times.
5966	6	6	16	The seventh time around, the priests blew the rams’ horns and Joshua told the army, “Give the battle cry, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is handing the city over to you!
5967	6	6	17	The city and all that is in it must be set apart for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house will live, because she hid the spies we sent.
5968	6	6	18	But be careful when you are setting apart the riches for God. If you take any of it, you will make the Israelite camp subject to annihilation and cause a disaster.
5969	6	6	19	All the silver and gold, as well as bronze and iron items, belong to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They must go into the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s treasury.”
5970	6	6	20	¶The rams’ horns sounded and when the army heard the signal, they gave a loud battle cry. The wall collapsed and the warriors charged straight ahead into the city and captured it.
5971	6	6	21	They annihilated with the sword everything that breathed in the city, including men and women, young and old, as well as cattle, sheep, and donkeys.
5972	6	6	22	Joshua told the two men who had spied on the land, “Enter the prostitute’s house and bring out the woman and all who belong to her as you promised her.”
5973	6	6	23	So the young spies went and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out her whole family and took them to a place outside the Israelite camp.
5974	6	6	24	But they burned the city and all that was in it, except for the silver, gold, and bronze and iron items they put in the treasury of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s house.
5975	6	6	25	Yet Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, her father’s family, and all who belonged to her. She lives in Israel to this very day because she hid the messengers Joshua sent to spy on Jericho.
5976	6	6	26	At that time Joshua made this solemn declaration: “The man who attempts to rebuild this city of Jericho will stand condemned before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He will lose his firstborn son when he lays its foundations and his youngest son when he erects its gates!”
5977	6	6	27	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with Joshua and he became famous throughout the land.
5978	6	7	1	¶But the Israelites disobeyed the command about the city’s riches. Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, stole some of the riches. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was furious with the Israelites.
5979	6	7	2	¶Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai (which is located near Beth Aven, east of Bethel) and instructed them, “Go up and spy on the land.” So the men went up and spied on Ai.
5980	6	7	3	They returned and reported to Joshua, “Don’t send the whole army. About two or three thousand men are adequate to defeat Ai. Don’t tire out the whole army, for Ai is small.”
5981	6	7	4	¶So about three thousand men went up, but they fled from the men of Ai.
5982	6	7	5	The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them and chased them from in front of the city gate all the way to the fissures and defeated them on the steep slope. The people’s courage melted away like water.
5983	6	7	6	¶Joshua tore his clothes; he and the leaders of Israel lay face down on the ground before the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> until evening and threw dirt on their heads.
5984	6	7	7	Joshua prayed, “O, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! Why did you bring these people across the Jordan to hand us over to the Amorites so they could destroy us? If only we had been satisfied to live on the other side of the Jordan!
5985	6	7	8	O Lord, what can I say now that Israel has retreated before its enemies?
5986	6	7	9	When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this, they will turn against us and destroy the very memory of us from the earth. What will you do to protect your great reputation?”
5987	6	7	10	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responded to Joshua, “Get up! Why are you lying there face down?
5988	6	7	11	Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenantal commandment! They have taken some of the riches; they have stolen them and deceitfully put them among their own possessions.
5989	6	7	12	The Israelites are unable to stand before their enemies; they retreat because they have become subject to annihilation. I will no longer be with you, unless you destroy what has contaminated you.
5990	6	7	13	Get up! Ritually consecrate the people and tell them this: ‘Ritually consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, because this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said, “You are contaminated, O Israel! You will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove what is contaminating you.”
5991	6	7	14	In the morning you must approach in tribal order. The tribe the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> selects must approach by clans. The clan the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> selects must approach by families. The family the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> selects must approach man by man.
5992	6	7	15	The one caught with the riches must be burned up along with all who belong to him, because he violated the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant and did such a disgraceful thing in Israel.’”
5993	6	7	16	¶Bright and early the next morning Joshua made Israel approach in tribal order, and the tribe of Judah was selected.
5994	6	7	17	He then made the clans of Judah approach, and the clan of the Zerahites was selected. He made the clan of the Zerahites approach, and Zabdi was selected.
5995	6	7	18	He then made Zabdi’s family approach man by man and Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was selected.
5996	6	7	19	So Joshua said to Achan, “My son, honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel and give him praise! Tell me what you did; don’t hide anything from me!”
5997	6	7	20	Achan told Joshua, “It is true. I have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel in this way:
5998	6	7	21	I saw among the goods we seized a nice robe from Babylon, two hundred silver pieces, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels. I wanted them, so I took them. They are hidden in the ground right in the middle of my tent with the silver underneath.”
5999	6	7	22	¶Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent. The things were hidden right in his tent, with the silver underneath.
6000	6	7	23	They took it all from the middle of the tent, brought it to Joshua and all the Israelites, and placed it before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
6001	6	7	24	Then Joshua and all Israel took Achan, son of Zerah, along with the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons, daughters, ox, donkey, sheep, tent, and all that belonged to him and brought them up to the Valley of Disaster.
6002	6	7	25	Joshua said, “Why have you brought disaster on us? The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will bring disaster on you today!” All Israel stoned him to death. (They also stoned and burned the others.)
6003	6	7	26	Then they erected over him a large pile of stones (it remains to this very day) and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anger subsided. So that place is called the Valley of Disaster to this very day.
6004	6	8	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Joshua, “Don’t be afraid and don’t panic! Take the whole army with you and march against Ai! See, I am handing over to you the king of Ai, along with his people, city, and land.
6005	6	8	2	Do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho and its king, except you may plunder its goods and cattle. Set an ambush behind the city!”
6006	6	8	3	¶Joshua and the whole army marched against Ai. Joshua selected thirty thousand brave warriors and sent them out at night.
6007	6	8	4	He ordered them, “Look, set an ambush behind the city. Don’t go very far from the city; all of you be ready!
6008	6	8	5	I and all the troops who are with me will approach the city. When they come out to fight us like before, we will retreat from them.
6009	6	8	6	They will attack us until we have lured them from the city, for they will say, ‘They are retreating from us like before.’ We will retreat from them.
6010	6	8	7	Then you rise up from your hiding place and seize the city. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will hand it over to you.
6011	6	8	8	When you capture the city, set it on fire in keeping with the Lord’s message. See, I have given you orders.”
6012	6	8	9	Joshua sent them away and they went to their hiding place west of Ai, between Bethel and Ai. Joshua spent that night with the army.
6013	6	8	10	¶Bright and early the next morning Joshua gathered the army, and he and the leaders of Israel marched at the head of it to Ai.
6014	6	8	11	All the troops that were with him marched up and drew near the city. They camped north of Ai on the other side of the valley.
6015	6	8	12	He took five thousand men and set an ambush west of the city between Bethel and Ai.
6016	6	8	13	The army was in position – the main army north of the city and the rear guard west of the city. That night Joshua went into the middle of the valley.
6017	6	8	14	¶When the king of Ai saw Israel, they rushed to get up early. Then the men of the city went out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people, at the meeting place near the rift valley. But he did not realize an ambush was waiting for him behind the city.
6018	6	8	15	Joshua and all Israel pretended to be defeated by them and they retreated along the way to the wilderness.
6019	6	8	16	All the reinforcements in Ai were ordered to chase them; they chased Joshua and were lured away from the city.
6020	6	8	17	No men were left in Ai or Bethel; they all went out after Israel. They left the city wide open and chased Israel.
6021	6	8	18	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Joshua, “Hold out toward Ai the curved sword in your hand, for I am handing the city over to you.” So Joshua held out toward Ai the curved sword in his hand.
6022	6	8	19	When he held out his hand, the men waiting in ambush rose up quickly from their place and attacked. They entered the city, captured it, and immediately set it on fire.
6023	6	8	20	When the men of Ai turned around, they saw the smoke from the city ascending into the sky and were so shocked they were unable to flee in any direction. In the meantime the men who were retreating to the wilderness turned against their pursuers.
6024	6	8	21	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that the city was going up in smoke, they turned around and struck down the men of Ai.
6025	6	8	22	At the same time the men who had taken the city came out to fight, and the men of Ai were trapped in the middle. The Israelites struck them down, leaving no survivors or refugees.
6026	6	8	23	But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
6027	6	8	24	¶When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai who had chased them toward the wilderness (they all fell by the sword), all Israel returned to Ai and put the sword to it.
6028	6	8	25	Twelve thousand men and women died that day, including all the men of Ai.
6029	6	8	26	Joshua kept holding out his curved sword until Israel had annihilated all who lived in Ai.
6030	6	8	27	But Israel did plunder the cattle and the goods of the city, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s orders to Joshua.
6031	6	8	28	Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanently uninhabited mound (it remains that way to this very day).
6032	6	8	29	He hung the king of Ai on a tree, leaving him exposed until evening. At sunset Joshua ordered that his corpse be taken down from the tree. They threw it down at the entrance of the city gate and erected over it a large pile of stones (it remains to this very day).
6033	6	8	30	¶Then Joshua built an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel on Mount Ebal,
6034	6	8	31	just as Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant had commanded the Israelites. As described in the law scroll of Moses, it was made with uncut stones untouched by an iron tool. On it they offered burnt sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and sacrificed tokens of peace.
6035	6	8	32	There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua inscribed on the stones a duplicate of the law written by Moses.
6036	6	8	33	All the people, rulers, leaders, and judges were standing on either side of the ark, in front of the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Both resident foreigners and native Israelites were there. Half the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and the other half in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant had previously instructed to them to do for the formal blessing ceremony.
6037	6	8	34	Then Joshua read aloud all the words of the law, including the blessings and the curses, just as they are written in the law scroll.
6038	6	8	35	Joshua read aloud every commandment Moses had given before the whole assembly of Israel, including the women, children, and resident foreigners who lived among them.
6039	6	9	1	¶When the news reached all the kings on the west side of the Jordan – in the hill country, the foothills, and all along the Mediterranean coast as far as Lebanon (including the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites) –
6040	6	9	2	they formed an alliance to fight against Joshua and Israel.
6041	6	9	3	¶When the residents of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho and Ai,
6042	6	9	4	they did something clever. They collected some provisions and put worn-out sacks on their donkeys, along with worn-out wineskins that were ripped and patched.
6043	6	9	5	They had worn-out, patched sandals on their feet and dressed in worn-out clothes. All their bread was dry and hard.
6044	6	9	6	They came to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant land. Make a treaty with us.”
6045	6	9	7	The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you live near us. So how can we make a treaty with you?”
6046	6	9	8	But they said to Joshua, “We are willing to be your subjects.” So Joshua said to them, “Who are you and where do you come from?”
6047	6	9	9	They told him, “Your subjects have come from a very distant land because of the reputation of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, for we have heard the news about all he did in Egypt
6048	6	9	10	and all he did to the two Amorite kings on the other side of the Jordan – King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan in Ashtaroth.
6049	6	9	11	Our leaders and all who live in our land told us, ‘Take provisions for your journey and go meet them. Tell them, “We are willing to be your subjects. Make a treaty with us.”’
6050	6	9	12	This bread of ours was warm when we packed it in our homes the day we started out to meet you, but now it is dry and hard.
6051	6	9	13	These wineskins we filled were brand new, but look how they have ripped. Our clothes and sandals have worn out because it has been a very long journey.”
6052	6	9	14	The men examined some of their provisions, but they failed to ask the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s advice.
6053	6	9	15	Joshua made a peace treaty with them and agreed to let them live. The leaders of the community sealed it with an oath.
6054	6	9	16	¶Three days after they made the treaty with them, the Israelites found out they were from the local area and lived nearby.
6055	6	9	17	So the Israelites set out and on the third day arrived at their cities – Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.
6056	6	9	18	The Israelites did not attack them because the leaders of the community had sworn an oath to them in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel. The whole community criticized the leaders,
6057	6	9	19	but all the leaders told the whole community, “We swore an oath to them in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel. So now we can’t hurt them!
6058	6	9	20	We must let them live so we can escape the curse attached to the oath we swore to them.”
6059	6	9	21	The leaders then added, “Let them live.” So they became woodcutters and water carriers for the whole community, as the leaders had decided.
6060	6	9	22	¶Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said to them, “Why did you trick us by saying, ‘We live far away from you,’ when you really live nearby?
6061	6	9	23	Now you are condemned to perpetual servitude as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
6062	6	9	24	They said to Joshua, “It was carefully reported to your subjects how the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God commanded Moses his servant to assign you the whole land and to destroy all who live in the land from before you. Because of you we were terrified we would lose our lives, so we did this thing.
6063	6	9	25	So now we are in your power. Do to us what you think is good and appropriate.”
6064	6	9	26	Joshua did as they said; he kept the Israelites from killing them
6065	6	9	27	and that day made them woodcutters and water carriers for the community and for the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at the divinely chosen site. (They continue in that capacity to this very day.)
6066	6	10	1	¶Adoni-Zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua captured Ai and annihilated it and its king as he did Jericho and its king. He also heard how the people of Gibeon made peace with Israel and lived among them.
6067	6	10	2	All Jerusalem was terrified because Gibeon was a large city, like one of the royal cities. It was larger than Ai and all its men were warriors.
6068	6	10	3	So King Adoni-Zedek of Jerusalem sent this message to King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon:
6069	6	10	4	“Come to my aid so we can attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”
6070	6	10	5	So the five Amorite kings (the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon) and all their troops gathered together and advanced. They deployed their troops and fought against Gibeon.
6071	6	10	6	¶The men of Gibeon sent this message to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, “Do not abandon your subjects! Come up here quickly and rescue us! Help us! For all the Amorite kings living in the hill country are attacking us.”
6072	6	10	7	So Joshua and his whole army, including the bravest warriors, marched up from Gilgal.
6073	6	10	8	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Joshua, “Don’t be afraid of them, for I am handing them over to you. Not one of them can resist you.”
6074	6	10	9	Joshua attacked them by surprise after marching all night from Gilgal.
6075	6	10	10	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> routed them before Israel. Israel thoroughly defeated them at Gibeon. They chased them up the road to the pass of Beth Horon and struck them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.
6076	6	10	11	As they fled from Israel on the slope leading down from Beth Horon, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> threw down on them large hailstones from the sky, all the way to Azekah. They died – in fact, more died from the hailstones than the Israelites killed with the sword.
6077	6	10	12	¶The day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> delivered the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> before Israel: ‡“O sun, stand still over Gibeon! ‡O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon!”
6078	6	10	13	¶The sun stood still and the moon stood motionless while the nation took vengeance on its enemies. The event is recorded in the Scroll of the Upright One. The sun stood motionless in the middle of the sky and did not set for about a full day.
6079	6	10	14	There has not been a day like it before or since. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> obeyed a man, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> fought for Israel!
6080	6	10	15	Then Joshua and all Israel returned to the camp at Gilgal.
6081	6	10	16	¶The five Amorite kings ran away and hid in the cave at Makkedah.
6082	6	10	17	Joshua was told, “The five kings have been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah.”
6083	6	10	18	Joshua said, “Roll large stones over the mouth of the cave and post guards in front of it.
6084	6	10	19	But don’t you delay! Chase your enemies and catch them! Don’t allow them to retreat to their cities, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is handing them over to you.”
6085	6	10	20	Joshua and the Israelites almost totally wiped them out, but some survivors did escape to the fortified cities.
6086	6	10	21	Then the whole army safely returned to Joshua at the camp in Makkedah. No one dared threaten the Israelites.
6087	6	10	22	Joshua said, “Open the cave’s mouth and bring the five kings out of the cave to me.”
6088	6	10	23	They did as ordered; they brought the five kings out of the cave to him – the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.
6089	6	10	24	When they brought the kings out to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the troops who accompanied him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came up and put their feet on their necks.
6090	6	10	25	Then Joshua said to them, “Don’t be afraid and don’t panic! Be strong and brave, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will do the same thing to all your enemies you fight.”
6091	6	10	26	Then Joshua executed them and hung them on five trees. They were left hanging on the trees until evening.
6092	6	10	27	At sunset Joshua ordered his men to take them down from the trees. They threw them into the cave where they had hidden and piled large stones over the mouth of the cave. (They remain to this very day.)
6093	6	10	28	¶That day Joshua captured Makkedah and put the sword to it and its king. He annihilated everyone who lived in it; he left no survivors. He did to its king what he had done to the king of Jericho.
6094	6	10	29	¶Joshua and all Israel marched from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against it.
6095	6	10	30	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> handed it and its king over to Israel, and Israel put the sword to all who lived there; they left no survivors. They did to its king what they had done to the king of Jericho.
6096	6	10	31	¶Joshua and all Israel marched from Libnah to Lachish. He deployed his troops and fought against it.
6097	6	10	32	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> handed Lachish over to Israel and they captured it on the second day. They put the sword to all who lived there, just as they had done to Libnah.
6098	6	10	33	Then King Horam of Gezer came up to help Lachish, but Joshua struck him down, as well as his army, until no survivors remained.
6099	6	10	34	¶Joshua and all Israel marched from Lachish to Eglon. They deployed troops and fought against it.
6100	6	10	35	That day they captured it and put the sword to all who lived there. That day they annihilated it just as they had done to Lachish.
6101	6	10	36	¶Joshua and all Israel marched up from Eglon to Hebron and fought against it.
6102	6	10	37	They captured it and put the sword to its king, all its surrounding cities, and all who lived in it; they left no survivors. As they had done at Eglon, they annihilated it and all who lived there.
6103	6	10	38	¶Joshua and all Israel turned to Debir and fought against it.
6104	6	10	39	They captured it, its king, and all its surrounding cities and put the sword to them. They annihilated everyone who lived there; they left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king what they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron.
6105	6	10	40	¶Joshua defeated the whole land, including the hill country, the Negev, the foothills, the slopes, and all their kings. He left no survivors. He annihilated everything that breathed, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel had commanded.
6106	6	10	41	Joshua conquered the area between Kadesh Barnea and Gaza and the whole region of Goshen, all the way to Gibeon.
6107	6	10	42	Joshua captured in one campaign all these kings and their lands, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel fought for Israel.
6108	6	10	43	Then Joshua and all Israel returned to the camp at Gilgal.
6109	6	11	1	¶When King Jabin of Hazor heard the news, he organized a coalition, including King Jobab of Madon, the king of Shimron, the king of Acshaph,
6110	6	11	2	and the northern kings who ruled in the hill country, the rift valley south of Kinnereth, the foothills, and the heights of Dor to the west.
6111	6	11	3	Canaanites came from the east and west; Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites from the hill country; and Hivites from below Hermon in the area of Mizpah.
6112	6	11	4	These kings came out with their armies; they were as numerous as the sand on the seashore and had a large number of horses and chariots.
6113	6	11	5	All these kings gathered and joined forces at the Waters of Merom to fight Israel.
6114	6	11	6	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Joshua, “Don’t be afraid of them, for about this time tomorrow I will cause all of them to lie dead before Israel. You must hamstring their horses and burn their chariots.”
6115	6	11	7	Joshua and his whole army caught them by surprise at the Waters of Merom and attacked them.
6116	6	11	8	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> handed them over to Israel and they struck them down and chased them all the way to Greater Sidon, Misrephoth Maim, and the Mizpah Valley to the east. They struck them down until no survivors remained.
6117	6	11	9	Joshua did to them as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots.
6118	6	11	10	¶At that time Joshua turned, captured Hazor, and struck down its king with the sword, for Hazor was at that time the leader of all these kingdoms.
6119	6	11	11	They annihilated everyone who lived there with the sword – no one who breathed remained – and burned Hazor.
6120	6	11	12	¶Joshua captured all these royal cities and all their kings and annihilated them with the sword, as Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant had commanded.
6121	6	11	13	But Israel did not burn any of the cities located on mounds, except for Hazor; it was the only one Joshua burned.
6122	6	11	14	The Israelites plundered all the goods of these cities and the cattle, but they totally destroyed all the people and allowed no one who breathed to live.
6123	6	11	15	Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant passed on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commands to Joshua, and Joshua did as he was told. He did not ignore any of the commands the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had given Moses.
6124	6	11	16	¶Joshua conquered the whole land, including the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the foothills, the rift valley, the hill country of Israel and its foothills,
6125	6	11	17	from Mount Halak on up to Seir, as far as Baal Gad in the Lebanon Valley below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and executed them.
6126	6	11	18	Joshua campaigned against these kings for quite some time.
6127	6	11	19	No city made peace with the Israelites (except the Hivites living in Gibeon); they had to conquer all of them,
6128	6	11	20	for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> determined to make them obstinate so they would attack Israel. He wanted Israel to annihilate them without mercy, as he had instructed Moses.
6129	6	11	21	¶At that time Joshua attacked and eliminated the Anakites from the hill country – from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and all the hill country of Judah and Israel. Joshua annihilated them and their cities.
6130	6	11	22	No Anakites were left in Israelite territory, though some remained in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.
6131	6	11	23	Joshua conquered the whole land, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had promised Moses, and he assigned Israel their tribal portions. Then the land was free of war.
6132	6	12	1	¶Now these are the kings of the land whom the Israelites defeated and drove from their land on the east side of the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon, including all the eastern rift valley:
6133	6	12	2	¶King Sihon of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley) – including the city in the middle of the valley and half of Gilead – all the way to the Jabbok Valley bordering Ammonite territory.
6134	6	12	3	His kingdom included the eastern rift valley from the Sea of Kinnereth to the sea of the rift valley (the Salt Sea), including the route to Beth Jeshimoth and the area southward below the slopes of Pisgah.
6135	6	12	4	¶The territory of King Og of Bashan, one of the few remaining Rephaites, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei
6136	6	12	5	and ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, all of Bashan to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and half of Gilead as far as the border of King Sihon of Heshbon.
6137	6	12	6	¶Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant and the Israelites defeated them and Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant assigned their land to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
6138	6	12	7	¶These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the Israelites defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal Gad in the Lebanon Valley to Mount Halak on up to Seir. Joshua assigned this territory to the Israelite tribes,
6139	6	12	8	including the hill country, the foothills, the rift valley, the slopes, the wilderness, and the Negev – the land of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites:
6140	6	12	9	‡the king of Jericho (one),‡the king of Ai – located near Bethel – (one),
6141	6	12	10	‡the king of Jerusalem (one),‡the king of Hebron (one),
6142	6	12	11	‡the king of Jarmuth (one),‡the king of Lachish (one),
6143	6	12	12	‡the king of Eglon (one),‡the king of Gezer (one),
6144	6	12	13	‡the king of Debir (one),‡the king of Geder (one),
6145	6	12	14	‡the king of Hormah (one),‡the king of Arad (one),

6156	6	13	1	¶When Joshua was very old, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told him, “You are very old, and a great deal of land remains to be conquered.
6157	6	13	2	This is the land that remains: all the territory of the Philistines and all the Geshurites,
6158	6	13	3	from the Shihor River east of Egypt northward to the territory of Ekron (it is regarded as Canaanite territory), including the area belonging to the five Philistine lords who ruled in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, as well as Avvite land
6159	6	13	4	to the south; all the Canaanite territory, from Arah in the region of Sidon to Aphek, as far as Amorite territory;
6160	6	13	5	the territory of Byblos and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
6161	6	13	6	I will drive out before the Israelites all who live in the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, all the Sidonians; you be sure to parcel it out to Israel as I instructed you.
6162	6	13	7	Now, divide up this land among the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”
6163	6	13	8	¶The other half of Manasseh, Reuben, and Gad received their allotted tribal lands on east side of the Jordan, just as Moses, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant, had assigned them.
6164	6	13	9	Their territory started from Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley), included the city in the middle of the valley, the whole plain of Medeba as far as Dibon,
6165	6	13	10	and all the cities of King Sihon of the Amorites who ruled in Heshbon, and ended at the Ammonite border.
6166	6	13	11	Their territory also included Gilead, Geshurite and Maacathite territory, all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah –
6167	6	13	12	the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei. (He was one of the few remaining Rephaites.) Moses defeated them and took their lands.
6168	6	13	13	But the Israelites did not conquer the Geshurites and Maacathites; Geshur and Maacah live among Israel to this very day.
6169	6	13	14	However, Moses did not assign land as an inheritance to the Levites; their inheritance is the sacrificial offerings made to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, as he instructed them.
6170	6	13	15	¶Moses assigned land to the tribe of Reuben by its clans.
6171	6	13	16	Their territory started at Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley) and included the city in the middle of the valley, the whole plain of Medeba,
6172	6	13	17	Heshbon and all its surrounding cities on the plain, including Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,
6173	6	13	18	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
6174	6	13	19	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley,
6175	6	13	20	Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth.
6176	6	13	21	It encompassed all the cities of the plain and the whole realm of King Sihon of the Amorites who ruled in Heshbon. Moses defeated him and the Midianite leaders Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba (they were subjects of Sihon and lived in his territory).
6177	6	13	22	The Israelites killed Balaam son of Beor, the omen reader, along with the others.
6178	6	13	23	The border of the tribe of Reuben was the Jordan. The land allotted to the tribe of Reuben by its clans included these cities and their towns.
6179	6	13	24	¶Moses assigned land to the tribe of Gad by its clans.
6180	6	13	25	Their territory included Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half of Ammonite territory as far as Aroer near Rabbah.
6181	6	13	26	Their territory ran from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir.
6182	6	13	27	It included the valley of Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, and the rest of the realm of King Sihon of Heshbon, the area east of the Jordan to the end of the Sea of Kinnereth.
6183	6	13	28	The land allotted to the tribe of Gad by its clans included these cities and their towns.
6184	6	13	29	¶Moses assigned land to the half-tribe of Manasseh by its clans.
6185	6	13	30	Their territory started at Mahanaim and encompassed all Bashan, the whole realm of King Og of Bashan, including all sixty cities in Havvoth Jair in Bashan.
6186	6	13	31	Half of Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities in the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were assigned to the descendants of Makir son of Manasseh, to half the descendants of Makir by their clans.
6187	6	13	32	¶These are the land assignments made by Moses in the rift valley plains of Moab east of the Jordan River opposite Jericho.
6188	6	13	33	However, Moses did not assign land as an inheritance to the Levites; their inheritance is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, as he instructed them.
6189	6	14	1	¶The following is a record of the territory assigned to the Israelites in the land of Canaan by Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the Israelite tribal leaders.
6190	6	14	2	The land assignments to the nine and a half tribes were made by drawing lots, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had instructed Moses.
6191	6	14	3	Now Moses had assigned land to the two and a half tribes east of the Jordan, but he assigned no land to the Levites.
6192	6	14	4	The descendants of Joseph were considered as two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites were allotted no territory, though they were assigned cities in which to live, along with the grazing areas for their cattle and possessions.
6193	6	14	5	The Israelites followed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s instructions to Moses and divided up the land.
6194	6	14	6	¶The men of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said about you and me to Moses, the man of God, at Kadesh Barnea.
6195	6	14	7	I was forty years old when Moses, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant, sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy on the land and I brought back to him an honest report.
6196	6	14	8	My countrymen who accompanied me frightened the people, but I remained loyal to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God.
6197	6	14	9	That day Moses made this solemn promise: ‘Surely the land on which you walked will belong to you and your descendants permanently, for you remained loyal to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.’
6198	6	14	10	So now, look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has preserved my life, just as he promised, these past forty-five years since the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke these words to Moses, during which Israel traveled through the wilderness. Now look, I am today eighty-five years old.
6199	6	14	11	Today I am still as strong as when Moses sent me out. I can fight and go about my daily activities with the same energy I had then.
6200	6	14	12	Now, assign me this hill country which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised me at that time! No doubt you heard at that time that the Anakites live there in large, fortified cities. But, assuming the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with me, I will conquer them, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised.”
6201	6	14	13	Joshua asked God to empower Caleb son of Jephunneh and assigned him Hebron.
6202	6	14	14	So Hebron remains the assigned land of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this very day because he remained loyal to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
6203	6	14	15	(Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba. Arba was a famous Anakite.) Then the land was free of war.
6204	6	15	1	¶The land allotted to the tribe of Judah by its clans reached to the border of Edom, to the wilderness of Zin in the Negev far to the south.
6205	6	15	2	Their southern border started at the southern tip of the Salt Sea,
6206	6	15	3	extended south of the Scorpion Ascent, crossed to Zin, went up from the south to Kadesh Barnea, crossed to Hezron, went up to Addar, and turned toward Karka.
6207	6	15	4	It then crossed to Azmon, extended to the Stream of Egypt, and ended at the sea. This was their southern border.
6208	6	15	5	¶The eastern border was the Salt Sea to the mouth of the Jordan River. ¶The northern border started north of the Salt Sea at the mouth of the Jordan,
6209	6	15	6	went up to Beth Hoglah, crossed north of Beth Arabah, and went up to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
6210	6	15	7	It then went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, turning northward to Gilgal (which is opposite the Pass of Adummim south of the valley), crossed to the waters of En Shemesh and extended to En Rogel.
6211	6	15	8	It then went up the Valley of Ben Hinnom to the slope of the Jebusites on the south (that is, Jerusalem), going up to the top of the hill opposite the Valley of Ben Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the Valley of the Rephaites to the north.
6212	6	15	9	It then went from the top of the hill to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, extended to the cities of Mount Ephron, and went to Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim).
6213	6	15	10	It then turned from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, crossed to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (that is Kesalon), descended to Beth Shemesh, and crossed to Timnah.
6214	6	15	11	It then extended to the slope of Ekron to the north, went toward Shikkeron, crossed to Mount Baalah, extended to Jabneel, and ended at the sea.
6215	6	15	12	¶The western border was the Mediterranean Sea. These were the borders of the tribe of Judah and its clans.
6216	6	15	13	¶Caleb son of Jephunneh was assigned Kiriath Arba (that is Hebron) within the tribe of Judah, according to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s instructions to Joshua. (Arba was the father of Anak.)
6217	6	15	14	Caleb drove out from there three Anakites – Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, descendants of Anak.
6218	6	15	15	From there he attacked the people of Debir. (Debir used to be called Kiriath Sepher.)
6219	6	15	16	Caleb said, “To the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher I will give my daughter Achsah as a wife.”
6220	6	15	17	When Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, captured it, Caleb gave Achsah his daughter to him as a wife.
6221	6	15	18	¶One time Achsah came and charmed her father so that she could ask him for some land. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb said to her, “What would you like?”
6222	6	15	19	She answered, “Please give me a special present. Since you have given me land in the Negev, now give me springs of water.” So he gave her both upper and lower springs.
6223	6	15	20	¶This is the land assigned to the tribe of Judah by its clans:
6224	6	15	21	These cities were located at the southern extremity of Judah’s tribal land near the border of Edom: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
6225	6	15	22	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
6226	6	15	23	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
6227	6	15	24	Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
6228	6	15	25	Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (that is, Hazor),
6229	6	15	26	Amam, Shema, Moladah,
6230	6	15	27	Hazar Gaddah, Heshbon, Beth Pelet,
6231	6	15	28	Hazar Shual, Beer Sheba, Biziothiah,
6232	6	15	29	Baalah, Iim, Ezem,
6233	6	15	30	Eltolad, Kesil, Hormah,
6234	6	15	31	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
6235	6	15	32	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon – a total of twenty-nine cities and their towns.
6236	6	15	33	¶These cities were in the foothills: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,
6237	6	15	34	Zanoah, En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam,
6238	6	15	35	Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,
6239	6	15	36	Shaaraim, Adithaim, and Gederah (or Gederothaim) – a total of fourteen cities and their towns.
6240	6	15	37	¶Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal Gad,
6241	6	15	38	Dilean, Mizpah, Joktheel,
6242	6	15	39	Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,
6243	6	15	40	Cabbon, Lahmas, Kitlish,
6244	6	15	41	Gederoth, Beth Dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah – a total of sixteen cities and their towns.
6245	6	15	42	¶Libnah, Ether, Ashan,
6246	6	15	43	Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
6247	6	15	44	Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah – a total of nine cities and their towns.
6248	6	15	45	¶Ekron and its surrounding towns and settlements;
6249	6	15	46	from Ekron westward, all those in the vicinity of Ashdod and their towns;
6250	6	15	47	Ashdod with its surrounding towns and settlements, and Gaza with its surrounding towns and settlements, as far as the Stream of Egypt and the border at the Mediterranean Sea.
6251	6	15	48	¶These cities were in the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
6252	6	15	49	Dannah, Kiriath Sannah (that is, Debir),
6253	6	15	50	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
6254	6	15	51	Goshen, Holon, and Giloh – a total of eleven cities and their towns.
6255	6	15	52	¶Arab, Dumah, Eshan,
6256	6	15	53	Janim, Beth Tappuah, Aphekah,
6257	6	15	54	Humtah, Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior – a total of nine cities and their towns.
6258	6	15	55	¶Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,
6259	6	15	56	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,
6260	6	15	57	Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah – a total of ten cities and their towns.
6261	6	15	58	¶Halhul, Beth Zur, Gedor,
6262	6	15	59	Maarath, Beth Anoth, and Eltekon – a total of six cities and their towns.
6263	6	15	60	¶Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim) and Rabbah – a total of two cities and their towns.
6264	6	15	61	¶These cities were in the wilderness: Beth Arabah, Middin, Secacah,
6265	6	15	62	Nibshan, the city of Salt, and En Gedi – a total of six cities and their towns.
6266	6	15	63	¶The men of Judah were unable to conquer the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. The Jebusites live with the people of Judah in Jerusalem to this very day.
6267	6	16	1	¶The land allotted to Joseph’s descendants extended from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho to the east, through the desert and on up from Jericho into the hill country of Bethel.
6268	6	16	2	The southern border extended from Bethel to Luz, and crossed to Arkite territory at Ataroth.
6269	6	16	3	It then descended westward to Japhletite territory, as far as the territory of lower Beth Horon and Gezer, and ended at the sea.
6270	6	16	4	¶Joseph’s descendants, Manasseh and Ephraim, were assigned their land.
6271	6	16	5	The territory of the tribe of Ephraim by its clans included the following: The border of their assigned land to the east was Ataroth Addar as far as upper Beth Horon.
6272	6	16	6	It then extended on to the sea, with Micmethath on the north. It turned eastward to Taanath Shiloh and crossed it on the east to Janoah.
6273	6	16	7	It then descended from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho, and extended to the Jordan River.
6274	6	16	8	From Tappuah it went westward to the Valley of Kanah and ended at the sea. This is the land assigned to the tribe of Ephraim by its clans.
6275	6	16	9	Also included were the cities set apart for the tribe of Ephraim within Manasseh’s territory, along with their towns.
6276	6	16	10	¶The Ephraimites did not conquer the Canaanites living in Gezer. The Canaanites live among the Ephraimites to this very day and do hard labor as their servants.
6277	6	17	1	¶The tribe of Manasseh, Joseph’s firstborn son, was also allotted land. The descendants of Makir, Manasseh’s firstborn and the father of Gilead, received land, for they were warriors. They were assigned Gilead and Bashan.
6278	6	17	2	The rest of Manasseh’s descendants were also assigned land by their clans, including the descendants of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These are the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans.
6279	6	17	3	¶Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
6280	6	17	4	They went before Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders and said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Moses to assign us land among our relatives.” So Joshua assigned them land among their uncles, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded.
6281	6	17	5	Manasseh was allotted ten shares of land, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan,
6282	6	17	6	for the daughters of Manasseh were assigned land among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.
6283	6	17	7	¶The border of Manasseh went from Asher to Micmethath which is near Shechem. It then went south toward those who live by En Tappuah.
6284	6	17	8	(The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah, located on the border of Manasseh, belonged to the tribe of Ephraim.)
6285	6	17	9	The border then descended southward to the Valley of Kanah. Ephraim was assigned cities there among the cities of Manasseh, but the border of Manasseh was north of the valley and ended at the sea.
6286	6	17	10	Ephraim’s territory was to the south, and Manasseh’s to the north. The sea was Manasseh’s western border and their territory touched Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.
6287	6	17	11	Within Issachar’s and Asher’s territory Manasseh was assigned Beth Shean, Ibleam, the residents of Dor, the residents of En Dor, the residents of Taanach, the residents of Megiddo, the three of Napheth, and the towns surrounding all these cities.
6288	6	17	12	But the men of Manasseh were unable to conquer these cities; the Canaanites managed to remain in those areas.
6289	6	17	13	Whenever the Israelites were strong militarily, they forced the Canaanites to do hard labor, but they never totally conquered them.
6290	6	17	14	¶The descendants of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you assigned us only one tribal allotment? After all, we have many people, for until now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has enabled us to increase in number.”
6291	6	17	15	Joshua replied to them, “Since you have so many people, go up into the forest and clear out a place to live in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaites, for the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you.”
6292	6	17	16	The descendants of Joseph said, “The whole hill country is inadequate for us, and the Canaanites living down in the valley in Beth Shean and its surrounding towns and in the Valley of Jezreel have chariots with iron-rimmed wheels.”
6293	6	17	17	Joshua said to the family of Joseph – to both Ephraim and Manasseh: “You have many people and great military strength. You will not have just one tribal allotment.
6294	6	17	18	The whole hill country will be yours; though it is a forest, you can clear it and it will be entirely yours. You can conquer the Canaanites, though they have chariots with iron-rimmed wheels and are strong.”
6295	6	18	1	¶The entire Israelite community assembled at Shiloh and there they set up the tent of meeting. Though they had subdued the land,
6296	6	18	2	seven Israelite tribes had not been assigned their allotted land.
6297	6	18	3	So Joshua said to the Israelites: “How long do you intend to put off occupying the land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of your ancestors has given you?
6298	6	18	4	Pick three men from each tribe. I will send them out to walk through the land and make a map of it for me.
6299	6	18	5	Divide it into seven regions. Judah will stay in its territory in the south, and the family of Joseph in its territory in the north.
6300	6	18	6	But as for you, map out the land into seven regions and bring it to me. I will draw lots for you here before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.
6301	6	18	7	But the Levites will not have an allotted portion among you, for their inheritance is to serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their allotted land east of the Jordan which Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant assigned them.”
6302	6	18	8	¶When the men started out, Joshua told those going to map out the land, “Go, walk through the land, map it out, and return to me. Then I will draw lots for you before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> here in Shiloh.”
6303	6	18	9	The men journeyed through the land and mapped it and its cities out into seven regions on a scroll. Then they came to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh.
6304	6	18	10	Joshua drew lots for them in Shiloh before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and divided the land among the Israelites according to their allotted portions.
6305	6	18	11	¶The first lot belonged to the tribe of Benjamin by its clans. Their allotted territory was between Judah and Joseph.
6306	6	18	12	Their northern border started at the Jordan, went up to the slope of Jericho on the north, ascended westward to the hill country, and extended to the wilderness of Beth Aven.
6307	6	18	13	It then crossed from there to Luz, to the slope of Luz to the south (that is, Bethel), and descended to Ataroth Addar located on the hill that is south of lower Beth Horon.
6308	6	18	14	It then turned on the west side southward from the hill near Beth Horon on the south and extended to Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a city belonging to the tribe of Judah. This is the western border.
6309	6	18	15	The southern side started on the edge of Kiriath Jearim and extended westward to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
6310	6	18	16	The border then descended to the edge of the hill country near the Valley of Ben Hinnom located in the Valley of the Rephaites to the north. It descended through the Valley of Hinnom to the slope of the Jebusites to the south and then down to En Rogel.
6311	6	18	17	It went northward, extending to En Shemesh and Geliloth opposite the Pass of Adummim, and descended to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
6312	6	18	18	It crossed to the slope in front of the rift valley to the north and descended into the rift valley.
6313	6	18	19	It then crossed to the slope of Beth Hoglah to the north and ended at the northern tip of the Salt Sea at the mouth of the Jordan River. This was the southern border.
6314	6	18	20	The Jordan River borders it on the east. These were the borders of the land assigned to the tribe of Benjamin by its clans.
6315	6	18	21	¶These cities belonged to the tribe of Benjamin by its clans: Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,
6316	6	18	22	Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
6317	6	18	23	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
6318	6	18	24	Kephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba – a total of twelve cities and their towns.
6319	6	18	25	¶Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
6320	6	18	26	Mizpah, Kephirah, Mozah,
6321	6	18	27	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
6322	6	18	28	Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath – a total of fourteen cities and their towns. This was the land assigned to the tribe of Benjamin by its clans.
6323	6	19	1	¶The second lot belonged to the tribe of Simeon by its clans. Their assigned land was in the middle of Judah’s assigned land.
6324	6	19	2	Their assigned land included Beer Sheba, Moladah,
6325	6	19	3	Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem,
6326	6	19	4	Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
6327	6	19	5	Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah,
6328	6	19	6	Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen – a total of thirteen cities and their towns,
6329	6	19	7	Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan – a total of four cities and their towns,
6330	6	19	8	as well as all the towns around these cities as far as Baalath Beer (Ramah of the Negev). This was the land assigned to the tribe of Simeon by its clans.
6331	6	19	9	Simeon’s assigned land was taken from Judah’s allotted portion, for Judah’s territory was too large for them; so Simeon was assigned land within Judah.
6332	6	19	10	¶The third lot belonged to the tribe of Zebulun by its clans. The border of their territory extended to Sarid.
6333	6	19	11	Their border went up westward to Maralah and touched Dabbesheth and the valley near Jokneam.
6334	6	19	12	From Sarid it turned eastward to the territory of Kisloth Tabor, extended to Daberath, and went up to Japhia.
6335	6	19	13	From there it crossed eastward to Gath Hepher and Eth Kazin and extended to Rimmon, turning toward Neah.
6336	6	19	14	It then turned on the north to Hannathon and ended at the Valley of Iphtah El.
6337	6	19	15	Their territory included Kattah, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem; in all they had twelve cities and their towns.
6338	6	19	16	This was the land assigned to the tribe of Zebulun by its clans, including these cities and their towns.
6339	6	19	17	¶The fourth lot belonged to the tribe of Issachar by its clans.
6340	6	19	18	Their assigned land included Jezreel, Kesulloth, Shunem,
6341	6	19	19	Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,
6342	6	19	20	Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,
6343	6	19	21	Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah and Beth Pazzez.
6344	6	19	22	Their border touched Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh, and ended at the Jordan. They had sixteen cities and their towns.
6345	6	19	23	This was the land assigned to the tribe of Issachar by its clans, including the cities and their towns.
6346	6	19	24	¶The fifth lot belonged to the tribe of Asher by its clans.
6347	6	19	25	Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Acshaph,
6348	6	19	26	Alammelech, Amad, and Mishal. Their border touched Carmel to the west and Shihor Libnath.
6349	6	19	27	It turned eastward toward Beth Dagon, touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah El to the north, as well as Beth Emek and Neiel, and extended to Cabul on the north
6350	6	19	28	and on to Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon.
6351	6	19	29	It then turned toward Ramah as far as the fortified city of Tyre, turned to Hosah, and ended at the sea near Hebel, Achzib,
6352	6	19	30	Umah, Aphek, and Rehob. In all they had twenty-two cities and their towns.
6353	6	19	31	This was the land assigned to the tribe of Asher by its clans, including these cities and their towns.
6354	6	19	32	¶The sixth lot belonged to the tribe of Naphtali by its clans.
6355	6	19	33	Their border started at Heleph and the oak of Zaanannim, went to Adami Nekeb, Jabneel and on to Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan River.
6356	6	19	34	It turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, extended from there to Hukok, touched Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and the Jordan on the east.
6357	6	19	35	The fortified cities included Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth,
6358	6	19	36	Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
6359	6	19	37	Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,
6360	6	19	38	Yiron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh. In all they had nineteen cities and their towns.
6361	6	19	39	This was the land assigned to the tribe of Naphtali by its clans, including the cities and their towns.
6362	6	19	40	¶The seventh lot belonged to the tribe of Dan by its clans.
6363	6	19	41	Their assigned land included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh,
6364	6	19	42	Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,
6365	6	19	43	Elon, Timnah, Ekron,
6366	6	19	44	Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
6367	6	19	45	Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,
6368	6	19	46	the waters of Jarkon, and Rakkon, including the territory in front of Joppa.
6369	6	19	47	(The Danites failed to conquer their territory, so they went up and fought with Leshem and captured it. They put the sword to it, took possession of it, and lived in it. They renamed it Dan after their ancestor.)
6370	6	19	48	This was the land assigned to the tribe of Dan by its clans, including these cities and their towns.
6371	6	19	49	¶When they finished dividing the land into its regions, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun some land.
6372	6	19	50	As the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had instructed, they gave him the city he requested – Timnath Serah in the Ephraimite hill country. He built up the city and lived in it.
6373	6	19	51	¶These are the land assignments which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the Israelite tribal leaders made by drawing lots in Shiloh before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at the entrance of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing up the land.
6374	6	20	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> instructed Joshua:
6375	6	20	2	“Have the Israelites select the cities of refuge that I told you about through Moses.
6376	6	20	3	Anyone who accidentally kills someone can escape there; these cities will be a place of asylum from the avenger of blood.
6377	6	20	4	The one who committed manslaughter should escape to one of these cities, stand at the entrance of the city gate, and present his case to the leaders of that city. They should then bring him into the city, give him a place to stay, and let him live there.
6378	6	20	5	When the avenger of blood comes after him, they must not hand over to him the one who committed manslaughter, for he accidentally killed his fellow man without premeditation.
6379	6	20	6	He must remain in that city until his case is decided by the assembly and the high priest dies. Then the one who committed manslaughter may return home to the city from which he escaped.”
6380	6	20	7	¶So they selected Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
6381	6	20	8	Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho they selected Bezer in the wilderness on the plain belonging to the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead belonging to the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan belonging to the tribe of Manasseh.
6382	6	20	9	These were the cities of refuge appointed for all the Israelites and for resident foreigners living among them. Anyone who accidentally killed someone could escape there and not be executed by the avenger of blood, at least until his case was reviewed by the assembly.
6383	6	21	1	¶The tribal leaders of the Levites went before Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and the Israelite tribal leaders
6384	6	21	2	in Shiloh in the land of Canaan and said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Moses to assign us cities in which to live along with the grazing areas for our cattle.”
6385	6	21	3	So the Israelites assigned these cities and their grazing areas to the Levites from their own holdings, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had instructed.
6386	6	21	4	¶The first lot belonged to the Kohathite clans. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest were allotted thirteen cities from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.
6387	6	21	5	The rest of Kohath’s descendants were allotted ten cities from the clans of the tribe of Ephraim, and from the tribe of Dan and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
6388	6	21	6	Gershon’s descendants were allotted thirteen cities from the clans of the tribe of Issachar, and from the tribes of Asher and Naphtali and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
6389	6	21	7	Merari’s descendants by their clans were allotted twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
6390	6	21	8	So the Israelites assigned to the Levites by lot these cities and their grazing areas, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had instructed Moses.
6391	6	21	9	¶They assigned from the tribes of Judah and Simeon the cities listed below.
6392	6	21	10	They were assigned to the Kohathite clans of the Levites who were descendants of Aaron, for the first lot belonged to them.
6393	6	21	11	They assigned them Kiriath Arba (Arba was the father of Anak), that is, Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, along with its surrounding grazing areas.
6394	6	21	12	(Now the city’s fields and surrounding towns they had assigned to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his property.)
6395	6	21	13	So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they assigned Hebron (a city of refuge for one who committed manslaughter), Libnah,
6396	6	21	14	Jattir, Eshtemoa,
6397	6	21	15	Holon, Debir,
6398	6	21	16	Ain, Juttah, and Beth Shemesh, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of nine cities taken from these two tribes.
6399	6	21	17	From the tribe of Benjamin they assigned Gibeon, Geba,
6400	6	21	18	Anathoth, and Almon, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of four cities.
6401	6	21	19	The priests descended from Aaron received thirteen cities and their grazing areas.
6402	6	21	20	¶The rest of the Kohathite clans of the Levites were allotted cities from the tribe of Ephraim.
6403	6	21	21	They assigned them Shechem (a city of refuge for one who committed manslaughter) in the hill country of Ephraim, Gezer,
6404	6	21	22	Kibzaim, and Beth Horon, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of four cities.
6405	6	21	23	From the tribe of Dan they assigned Eltekeh, Gibbethon,
6406	6	21	24	Aijalon, and Gath Rimmon, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of four cities.
6407	6	21	25	From the half-tribe of Manasseh they assigned Taanach and Gath Rimmon, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of two cities.
6408	6	21	26	The rest of the Kohathite clans received ten cities and their grazing areas.
6409	6	21	27	¶They assigned to the Gershonite clans of the Levites the following cities: from the half-tribe of Manasseh: Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge for one who committed manslaughter) and Beeshtarah, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of two cities;
6410	6	21	28	from the tribe of Issachar: Kishon, Daberath,
6411	6	21	29	Jarmuth, and En Gannim, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of four cities;
6412	6	21	30	from the tribe of Asher: Mishal, Abdon,
6413	6	21	31	Helkath, and Rehob, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of four cities;
6414	6	21	32	from the tribe of Naphtali: Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for one who committed manslaughter), Hammoth Dor, and Kartan, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of three cities.
6415	6	21	33	The Gershonite clans received thirteen cities and their grazing areas.
6416	6	21	34	¶They assigned to the Merarite clans (the remaining Levites) the following cities: from the tribe of Zebulun: Jokneam, Kartah,
6417	6	21	35	Dimnah, and Nahalal, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of four cities;
6418	6	21	36	from the tribe of Reuben: Bezer, Jahaz,
6419	6	21	37	Kedemoth, and Mephaath, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of four cities;
6420	6	21	38	from the tribe of Gad: Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge for one who committed manslaughter), Mahanaim,
6421	6	21	39	Heshbon, and Jazer, along with the grazing areas of each – a total of four cities.
6422	6	21	40	The Merarite clans (the remaining Levites) were allotted twelve cities.
6423	6	21	41	¶The Levites received within the land owned by the Israelites forty-eight cities in all and their grazing areas.
6424	6	21	42	Each of these cities had grazing areas around it; they were alike in this regard.
6425	6	21	43	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave Israel all the land he had solemnly promised to their ancestors, and they conquered it and lived in it.
6426	6	21	44	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made them secure, in fulfillment of all he had solemnly promised their ancestors. None of their enemies could resist them. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> handed all their enemies over to them.
6427	6	21	45	Not one of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s faithful promises to the family of Israel was left unfulfilled; every one was realized.
6428	6	22	1	¶Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh
6429	6	22	2	and told them: “You have carried out all the instructions of Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant, and you have obeyed all I have told you.
6430	6	22	3	You have not abandoned your fellow Israelites this entire time, right up to this very day. You have completed the task given you by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
6431	6	22	4	Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has made your fellow Israelites secure, just as he promised them. So now you may turn around and go to your homes in your own land which Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant assigned to you east of the Jordan.
6432	6	22	5	But carefully obey the commands and instructions Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant gave you. Love the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, follow all his instructions, obey his commands, be loyal to him, and serve him with all your heart and being!”
6433	6	22	6	¶Joshua rewarded them and sent them on their way; they returned to their homes.
6434	6	22	7	(Now to one half-tribe of Manasseh, Moses had assigned land in Bashan; and to the other half Joshua had assigned land on the west side of the Jordan with their fellow Israelites.) When Joshua sent them home, he rewarded them,
6435	6	22	8	saying, “Take home great wealth, a lot of cattle, silver, gold, bronze, iron, and a lot of clothing. Divide up the goods captured from your enemies with your brothers.”
6436	6	22	9	So the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites in Shiloh in the land of Canaan and headed home to their own land in Gilead, which they acquired by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s command through Moses.
6437	6	22	10	¶The Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan and built there, near the Jordan, an impressive altar.
6438	6	22	11	The Israelites received this report: “Look, the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the entrance to the land of Canaan, at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side.”
6439	6	22	12	When the Israelites heard this, the entire Israelite community assembled at Shiloh to launch an attack against them.
6440	6	22	13	¶The Israelites sent Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
6441	6	22	14	He was accompanied by ten leaders, one from each of the Israelite tribes, each one a family leader among the Israelite clans.
6442	6	22	15	They went to the land of Gilead to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and said to them:
6443	6	22	16	“The entire community of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘Why have you disobeyed the God of Israel by turning back today from following the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>? You built an altar for yourselves and have rebelled today against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
6444	6	22	17	The sin we committed at Peor was bad enough. To this very day we have not purified ourselves; it even brought a plague on the community of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
6445	6	22	18	Now today you dare to turn back from following the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! You are rebelling today against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; tomorrow he may break out in anger against the entire community of Israel.
6446	6	22	19	But if your own land is impure, cross over to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s own land, where the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> himself lives, and settle down among us. But don’t rebel against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> or us by building for yourselves an altar aside from the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.
6447	6	22	20	When Achan son of Zerah disobeyed the command about the city’s riches, the entire Israelite community was judged, though only one man had sinned. He most certainly died for his sin!’”
6448	6	22	21	¶The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the leaders of the Israelite clans:
6449	6	22	22	“El, God, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! El, God, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! He knows the truth! Israel must also know! If we have rebelled or disobeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, don’t spare us today!
6450	6	22	23	If we have built an altar for ourselves to turn back from following the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by making burnt sacrifices and grain offerings on it, or by offering tokens of peace on it, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> himself will punish us.
6451	6	22	24	We swear we have done this because we were worried that in the future your descendants would say to our descendants, ‘What relationship do you have with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel?
6452	6	22	25	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made the Jordan a boundary between us and you Reubenites and Gadites. You have no right to worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’ In this way your descendants might cause our descendants to stop obeying the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
6453	6	22	26	So we decided to build this altar, not for burnt offerings and sacrifices,
6454	6	22	27	but as a reminder to us and you, and to our descendants who follow us, that we will honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in his very presence with burnt offerings, sacrifices, and tokens of peace. Then in the future your descendants will not be able to say to our descendants, ‘You have no right to worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’
6455	6	22	28	We said, ‘If in the future they say such a thing to us or to our descendants, we will reply, “See the model of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s altar that our ancestors made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a reminder to us and you.”’
6456	6	22	29	Far be it from us to rebel against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by turning back today from following after the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by building an altar for burnt offerings, sacrifices, and tokens of peace aside from the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God located in front of his dwelling place!”
6457	6	22	30	¶When Phinehas the priest and the community leaders and Israel’s clan leaders who accompanied him heard the defense of the Reubenites, Gadites, and the Manassehites, they were satisfied.
6458	6	22	31	Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest, said to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the Manassehites, “Today we know that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is among us, because you have not disobeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in this. Now you have rescued the Israelites from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s judgment.”
6459	6	22	32	¶Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest, and the leaders left the Reubenites and Gadites in the land of Gilead and reported back to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
6460	6	22	33	The Israelites were satisfied with their report and gave thanks to God. They said nothing more about launching an attack to destroy the land in which the Reubenites and Gadites lived.
6461	6	22	34	The Reubenites and Gadites named the altar, “Surely it is a Reminder to us that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is God.”
6462	6	23	1	¶A long time passed after the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made Israel secure from all their enemies, and Joshua was very old.
6463	6	23	2	So Joshua summoned all Israel, including the elders, rulers, judges, and leaders, and told them: “I am very old.
6464	6	23	3	You saw everything the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God did to all these nations on your behalf, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God fights for you.
6465	6	23	4	See, I have parceled out to your tribes these remaining nations, from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, including all the nations I defeated.
6466	6	23	5	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will drive them out from before you and remove them, so you can occupy their land as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God promised you.
6467	6	23	6	Be very strong! Carefully obey all that is written in the law scroll of Moses so you won’t swerve from it to the right or the left,
6468	6	23	7	or associate with these nations that remain near you. You must not invoke or make solemn declarations by the names of their gods! You must not worship or bow down to them!
6469	6	23	8	But you must be loyal to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, as you have been to this very day.
6470	6	23	9	¶“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> drove out from before you great and mighty nations; no one has been able to resist you to this very day.
6471	6	23	10	One of you makes a thousand run away, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God fights for you as he promised you he would.
6472	6	23	11	Watch yourselves carefully! Love the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God!
6473	6	23	12	But if you ever turn away and make alliances with these nations that remain near you, and intermarry with them and establish friendly relations with them,
6474	6	23	13	know for certain that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God will no longer drive out these nations from before you. They will trap and ensnare you; they will be a whip that tears your sides and thorns that blind your eyes until you disappear from this good land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God gave you.
6475	6	23	14	¶“Look, today I am about to die. You know with all your heart and being that not even one of all the faithful promises the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God made to you is left unfulfilled; every one was realized – not one promise is unfulfilled!
6476	6	23	15	But in the same way every faithful promise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God made to you has been realized, it is just as certain, if you disobey, that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will bring on you every judgment until he destroys you from this good land which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God gave you.
6477	6	23	16	If you violate the covenantal laws of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God which he commanded you to keep, and follow, worship, and bow down to other gods, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be very angry with you and you will disappear quickly from the good land which he gave to you.”
6478	6	24	1	¶Joshua assembled all the Israelite tribes at Shechem. He summoned Israel’s elders, rulers, judges, and leaders, and they appeared before God.
6479	6	24	2	Joshua told all the people, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said: ‘In the distant past your ancestors lived beyond the Euphrates River, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor. They worshiped other gods,
6480	6	24	3	but I took your father Abraham from beyond the Euphrates and brought him into the entire land of Canaan. I made his descendants numerous; I gave him Isaac,
6481	6	24	4	and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I assigned Mount Seir, while Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
6482	6	24	5	I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt down when I intervened in their land. Then I brought you out.
6483	6	24	6	When I brought your fathers out of Egypt, you arrived at the sea. The Egyptians chased your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
6484	6	24	7	Your fathers cried out for help to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; he made the area between you and the Egyptians dark, and then drowned them in the sea. You witnessed with your very own eyes what I did in Egypt. You lived in the wilderness for a long time.
6485	6	24	8	Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought with you, but I handed them over to you; you conquered their land and I destroyed them from before you.
6486	6	24	9	Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, launched an attack against Israel. He summoned Balaam son of Beor to call down judgment on you.
6487	6	24	10	I refused to respond to Balaam; he kept prophesying good things about you, and I rescued you from his power.
6488	6	24	11	You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The leaders of Jericho, as well as the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites, fought with you, but I handed them over to you.
6489	6	24	12	I sent terror ahead of you to drive out before you the two Amorite kings. I gave you the victory; it was not by your swords or bows.
6490	6	24	13	I gave you a land in which you had not worked hard; you took up residence in cities you did not build and you are eating the produce of vineyards and olive groves you did not plant.’
6491	6	24	14	¶Now obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and worship him with integrity and loyalty. Put aside the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt and worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
6492	6	24	15	If you have no desire to worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, choose today whom you will worship, whether it be the gods whom your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. But I and my family will worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
6493	6	24	16	¶The people responded, “Far be it from us to abandon the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> so we can worship other gods!
6494	6	24	17	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God took us and our fathers out of slavery in the land of Egypt and performed these awesome miracles before our very eyes. He continually protected us as we traveled and when we passed through nations.
6495	6	24	18	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> drove out from before us all the nations, including the Amorites who lived in the land. So we too will worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for he is our God!”
6496	6	24	19	¶Joshua warned the people, “You will not keep worshiping the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God who will not forgive your rebellion or your sins.
6497	6	24	20	If you abandon the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and worship foreign gods, he will turn against you; he will bring disaster on you and destroy you, though he once treated you well.”
6498	6	24	21	¶The people said to Joshua, “No! We really will worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
6499	6	24	22	Joshua said to the people, “Do you agree to be witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?” They replied, “We are witnesses!”
6500	6	24	23	Joshua said, “Now put aside the foreign gods that are among you and submit to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.”
6501	6	24	24	¶The people said to Joshua, “We will worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God and obey him.”
6502	6	24	25	¶That day Joshua drew up an agreement for the people, and he established rules and regulations for them in Shechem.
6503	6	24	26	Joshua wrote these words in the Law Scroll of God. He then took a large stone and set it up there under the oak tree near the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s shrine.
6504	6	24	27	Joshua said to all the people, “Look, this stone will be a witness against us, for it has heard everything the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to us. It will be a witness against you if you deny your God.”
6505	6	24	28	When Joshua dismissed the people, they went to their allotted portions of land.
6506	6	24	29	¶After all this Joshua son of Nun, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant, died at the age of one hundred ten.
6507	6	24	30	They buried him in his allotted territory in Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
6508	6	24	31	Israel worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> throughout Joshua’s lifetime and as long as the elderly men who outlived him remained alive. These men had experienced firsthand everything the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had done for Israel.
6509	6	24	32	¶The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the part of the field that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of money. So it became the inheritance of the tribe of Joseph.
6510	6	24	33	¶Eleazar son of Aaron died, and they buried him in Gibeah in the hill country of Ephraim, where his son Phinehas had been assigned land.
6511	7	1	1	¶After Joshua died, the Israelites asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Who should lead the invasion against the Canaanites and launch the attack?”
6512	7	1	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “The men of Judah should take the lead. Be sure of this! I am handing the land over to them.”
6513	7	1	3	The men of Judah said to their relatives, the men of Simeon, “Invade our allotted land with us and help us attack the Canaanites. Then we will go with you into your allotted land.” So the men of Simeon went with them.
6514	7	1	4	¶The men of Judah attacked, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> handed the Canaanites and Perizzites over to them. They killed ten thousand men at Bezek.
6515	7	1	5	They met Adoni-Bezek at Bezek and fought him. They defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites.
6516	7	1	6	When Adoni-Bezek ran away, they chased him and captured him. Then they cut off his thumbs and big toes.
6517	7	1	7	Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings, with thumbs and big toes cut off, used to lick up food scraps under my table. God has repaid me for what I did to them.” They brought him to Jerusalem, where he died.
6518	7	1	8	The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They put the sword to it and set the city on fire.
6519	7	1	9	¶Later the men of Judah went down to attack the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev, and the foothills.
6520	7	1	10	The men of Judah attacked the Canaanites living in Hebron. (Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba.) They killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
6521	7	1	11	From there they attacked the people of Debir. (Debir used to be called Kiriath Sepher.)
6522	7	1	12	Caleb said, “To the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher I will give my daughter Achsah as a wife.”
6523	7	1	13	When Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it, Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife.
6524	7	1	14	¶One time Achsah came and charmed her father so she could ask him for some land. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb said to her, “What would you like?”
6525	7	1	15	She answered, “Please give me a special present. Since you have given me land in the Negev, now give me springs of water.” So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs.
6526	7	1	16	¶Now the descendants of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of date palm trees to Arad in the wilderness of Judah, located in the Negev. They went and lived with the people of Judah.
6527	7	1	17	¶The men of Judah went with their brothers the men of Simeon and defeated the Canaanites living in Zephath. They wiped out Zephath. So people now call the city Hormah.
6528	7	1	18	The men of Judah captured Gaza, Ashkelon, Ekron, and the territory surrounding each of these cities.
6529	7	1	19	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with the men of Judah. They conquered the hill country, but they could not conquer the people living in the coastal plain, because they had chariots with iron-rimmed wheels.
6530	7	1	20	Caleb received Hebron, just as Moses had promised. He drove out the three Anakites.
6531	7	1	21	The men of Benjamin, however, did not conquer the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. The Jebusites live with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this very day.
6532	7	1	22	¶When the men of Joseph attacked Bethel, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with them.
6533	7	1	23	When the men of Joseph spied out Bethel (it used to be called Luz),
6534	7	1	24	the spies spotted a man leaving the city. They said to him, “If you show us a secret entrance into the city, we will reward you.”
6535	7	1	25	He showed them a secret entrance into the city, and they put the city to the sword. But they let the man and his extended family leave safely.
6536	7	1	26	He moved to Hittite country and built a city. He named it Luz, and it has kept that name to this very day.
6537	7	1	27	¶The men of Manasseh did not conquer Beth Shean, Taanach, or their surrounding towns. Nor did they conquer the people living in Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo or their surrounding towns. The Canaanites managed to remain in those areas.
6538	7	1	28	Whenever Israel was strong militarily, they forced the Canaanites to do hard labor, but they never totally conquered them.
6539	7	1	29	¶The men of Ephraim did not conquer the Canaanites living in Gezer. The Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.
6540	7	1	30	¶The men of Zebulun did not conquer the people living in Kitron and Nahalol. The Canaanites lived among them and were forced to do hard labor.
6541	7	1	31	¶The men of Asher did not conquer the people living in Acco or Sidon, nor did they conquer Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphek, or Rehob.
6542	7	1	32	The people of Asher live among the Canaanites residing in the land because they did not conquer them.
6543	7	1	33	¶The men of Naphtali did not conquer the people living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath. They live among the Canaanites residing in the land. The Canaanites living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were forced to do hard labor for them.
6544	7	1	34	¶The Amorites forced the people of Dan to live in the hill country. They did not allow them to live in the coastal plain.
6545	7	1	35	The Amorites managed to remain in Har Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. Whenever the tribe of Joseph was strong militarily, the Amorites were forced to do hard labor.
6546	7	1	36	The border of Amorite territory ran from the Scorpion Ascent to Sela and on up.
6547	7	2	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel went up from Gilgal to Bokim. He said, “I brought you up from Egypt and led you into the land I had solemnly promised to give to your ancestors. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you,
6548	7	2	2	but you must not make an agreement with the people who live in this land. You should tear down the altars where they worship.’ But you have disobeyed me. Why would you do such a thing?
6549	7	2	3	At that time I also warned you, ‘If you disobey, I will not drive out the Canaanites before you. They will ensnare you and their gods will lure you away.’”
6550	7	2	4	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel finished speaking these words to all the Israelites, the people wept loudly.
6551	7	2	5	They named that place Bokim and offered sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> there.
6552	7	2	6	¶When Joshua dismissed the people, the Israelites went to their allotted portions of territory, intending to take possession of the land.
6553	7	2	7	The people worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> throughout Joshua’s lifetime and as long as the elderly men who outlived him remained alive. These men had witnessed all the great things the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had done for Israel.
6554	7	2	8	Joshua son of Nun, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant, died at the age of one hundred ten.
6555	7	2	9	The people buried him in his allotted land in Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
6556	7	2	10	That entire generation passed away; a new generation grew up that had not personally experienced the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence or seen what he had done for Israel.
6557	7	2	11	¶The Israelites did evil before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by worshiping the Baals.
6558	7	2	12	They abandoned the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors who brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods – the gods of the nations who lived around them. They worshiped them and made the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> angry.
6559	7	2	13	They abandoned the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and worshiped Baal and the Ashtoreths.
6560	7	2	14	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was furious with Israel and handed them over to robbers who plundered them. He turned them over to their enemies who lived around them. They could no longer withstand their enemies’ attacks.
6561	7	2	15	Whenever they went out to fight, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did them harm, just as he had warned and solemnly vowed he would do. They suffered greatly.
6562	7	2	16	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> raised up leaders who delivered them from these robbers.
6563	7	2	17	But they did not obey their leaders. Instead they prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. They quickly turned aside from the path their ancestors had walked. Their ancestors had obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commands, but they did not.
6564	7	2	18	When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> raised up leaders for them, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with each leader and delivered the people from their enemies while the leader remained alive. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> felt sorry for them when they cried out in agony because of what their harsh oppressors did to them.
6565	7	2	19	When a leader died, the next generation would again act more wickedly than the previous one. They would follow after other gods, worshiping them and bowing down to them. They did not give up their practices or their stubborn ways.
6566	7	2	20	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was furious with Israel. He said, “This nation has violated the terms of the covenant I made with their ancestors by disobeying me.
6567	7	2	21	So I will no longer remove before them any of the nations that Joshua left unconquered when he died,
6568	7	2	22	in order to test Israel. I want to see whether or not the people will carefully walk in the path marked out by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, as their ancestors were careful to do.”
6569	7	2	23	This is why the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> permitted these nations to remain and did not conquer them immediately; he did not hand them over to Joshua.
6570	7	3	1	¶These were the nations the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> permitted to remain so he could use them to test Israel – he wanted to test all those who had not experienced battle against the Canaanites.
6571	7	3	2	He left those nations simply because he wanted to teach the subsequent generations of Israelites, who had not experienced the earlier battles, how to conduct holy war.
6572	7	3	3	These were the nations: the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
6573	7	3	4	They were left to test Israel, so the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> would know if his people would obey the commands he gave their ancestors through Moses.
6574	7	3	5	¶The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
6575	7	3	6	They took the Canaanites’ daughters as wives and gave their daughters to the Canaanites; they worshiped their gods as well.
6576	7	3	7	¶The Israelites did evil in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight. They forgot the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God and worshiped the Baals and the Asherahs.
6577	7	3	8	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was furious with Israel and turned them over to King Cushan-Rishathaim of Armon-Haraim. They were Cushan-Rishathaim’s subjects for eight years.
6578	7	3	9	When the Israelites cried out for help to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he raised up a deliverer for the Israelites who rescued them. His name was Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
6579	7	3	10	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit empowered him and he led Israel. When he went to do battle, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> handed over to him King Cushan-Rishathaim of Armon and he overpowered him.
6580	7	3	11	The land had rest for forty years; then Othniel son of Kenaz died.
6581	7	3	12	¶The Israelites again did evil in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave King Eglon of Moab control over Israel because they had done evil in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight.
6582	7	3	13	Eglon formed alliances with the Ammonites and Amalekites. He came and defeated Israel, and they seized the city of date palm trees .
6583	7	3	14	The Israelites were subject to King Eglon of Moab for eighteen years.
6584	7	3	15	¶When the Israelites cried out for help to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he raised up a deliverer for them. His name was Ehud son of Gera the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The Israelites sent him to King Eglon of Moab with their tribute payment.
6585	7	3	16	Ehud made himself a sword – it had two edges and was eighteen inches long. He strapped it under his coat on his right thigh.
6586	7	3	17	He brought the tribute payment to King Eglon of Moab. (Now Eglon was a very fat man.)
6587	7	3	18	¶After Ehud brought the tribute payment, he dismissed the people who had carried it.
6588	7	3	19	But he went back once he reached the carved images at Gilgal. He said to Eglon, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” Eglon said, “Be quiet!” All his attendants left.
6589	7	3	20	When Ehud approached him, he was sitting in his well-ventilated upper room all by himself. Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” When Eglon rose up from his seat,
6590	7	3	21	Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled the sword from his right thigh, and drove it into Eglon’s belly.
6591	7	3	22	The handle went in after the blade, and the fat closed around the blade, for Ehud did not pull the sword out of his belly.
6592	7	3	23	As Ehud went out into the vestibule, he closed the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.
6593	7	3	24	¶When Ehud had left, Eglon’s servants came and saw the locked doors of the upper room. They said, “He must be relieving himself in the well-ventilated inner room.”
6594	7	3	25	They waited so long they were embarrassed, but he still did not open the doors of the upper room. Finally they took the key and opened the doors. Right before their eyes was their master, sprawled out dead on the floor!
6595	7	3	26	Now Ehud had escaped while they were delaying. When he passed the carved images, he escaped to Seirah.
6596	7	3	27	¶When he reached Seirah, he blew a trumpet in the Ephraimite hill country. The Israelites went down with him from the hill country, with Ehud in the lead.
6597	7	3	28	He said to them, “Follow me, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is about to defeat your enemies, the Moabites!” They followed him, captured the fords of the Jordan River opposite Moab, and did not let anyone cross.
6598	7	3	29	That day they killed about ten thousand Moabites – all strong, capable warriors; not one escaped.
6599	7	3	30	Israel humiliated Moab that day, and the land had rest for eighty years.
6600	7	3	31	¶After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath. He killed six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. So he also delivered Israel.
6601	7	4	1	¶The Israelites again did evil in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight after Ehud’s death.
6602	7	4	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> turned them over to King Jabin of Canaan, who ruled in Hazor. The general of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth Haggoyim.
6603	7	4	3	The Israelites cried out for help to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, because Sisera had nine hundred chariots with iron-rimmed wheels, and he cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years.
6604	7	4	4	¶Now Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was leading Israel at that time.
6605	7	4	5	She would sit under the Date Palm Tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the Ephraimite hill country. The Israelites would come up to her to have their disputes settled.
6606	7	4	6	¶She summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali. She said to him, “Is it not true that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel is commanding you? Go, march to Mount Tabor! Take with you ten thousand men from Naphtali and Zebulun!
6607	7	4	7	I will bring Sisera, the general of Jabin’s army, to you at the Kishon River, along with his chariots and huge army. I will hand him over to you.”
6608	7	4	8	Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I will go. But if you do not go with me, I will not go.”
6609	7	4	9	She said, “I will indeed go with you. But you will not gain fame on the expedition you are undertaking, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will turn Sisera over to a woman.” Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.
6610	7	4	10	Barak summoned men from Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; Deborah went up with him as well.
6611	7	4	11	Now Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses’ father-in-law. He lived near the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh.
6612	7	4	12	¶When Sisera heard that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,
6613	7	4	13	he ordered all his chariotry – nine hundred chariots with iron-rimmed wheels – and all the troops he had with him to go from Harosheth Haggoyim to the River Kishon.
6614	7	4	14	Deborah said to Barak, “Spring into action, for this is the day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is handing Sisera over to you! Has the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> not taken the lead?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.
6615	7	4	15	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> routed Sisera, all his chariotry, and all his army with the edge of the sword. Sisera jumped out of his chariot and ran away on foot.
6616	7	4	16	Now Barak chased the chariots and the army all the way to Harosheth Haggoyim. Sisera’s whole army died by the edge of the sword; not even one survived!
6617	7	4	17	¶Now Sisera ran away on foot to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, for King Jabin of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite had made a peace treaty.
6618	7	4	18	Jael came out to welcome Sisera. She said to him, “Stop and rest, my lord. Stop and rest with me. Don’t be afraid.” So Sisera stopped to rest in her tent, and she put a blanket over him.
6619	7	4	19	He said to her, “Give me a little water to drink, because I’m thirsty.” She opened a goatskin container of milk and gave him some milk to drink. Then she covered him up again.
6620	7	4	20	He said to her, “Stand watch at the entrance to the tent. If anyone comes along and asks you, ‘Is there a man here?’ say, ‘No.’”
6621	7	4	21	Then Jael wife of Heber took a tent peg in one hand and a hammer in the other. She crept up on him, drove the tent peg through his temple into the ground while he was asleep from exhaustion, and he died.
6622	7	4	22	Now Barak was chasing Sisera. Jael went out to welcome him. She said to him, “Come here and I will show you the man you are searching for.” He went with her into the tent, and there he saw Sisera sprawled out dead with the tent peg in his temple.
6623	7	4	23	¶That day God humiliated King Jabin of Canaan before the Israelites.
6624	7	4	24	Israel’s power continued to overwhelm King Jabin of Canaan until they did away with him.
6625	7	5	1	¶On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this victory song:
6626	7	5	2	‡“When the leaders took the lead in Israel,‡When the people answered the call to war – ‡Praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!
6627	7	5	3	‡Hear, O kings!‡Pay attention, O rulers!‡I will sing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! ‡I will sing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel!
6628	7	5	4	‡O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, when you departed from Seir,‡when you marched from Edom’s plains,‡the earth shook, the heavens poured down,‡the clouds poured down rain.
6629	7	5	5	‡The mountains trembled before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of Sinai; ‡before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
6630	7	5	6	‡In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,‡in the days of Jael caravans disappeared; ‡travelers had to go on winding side roads.
6631	7	5	7	‡Warriors were scarce, ‡they were scarce in Israel,‡until you arose, Deborah,‡until you arose as a motherly protector in Israel.
6632	7	5	8	‡God chose new leaders, ‡then fighters appeared in the city gates; ‡but, I swear, not a shield or spear could be found, ‡among forty military units in Israel.
6633	7	5	9	‡My heart went out to Israel’s leaders,‡to the people who answered the call to war. ‡Praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!
6634	7	5	10	‡You who ride on light-colored female donkeys,‡who sit on saddle blankets, ‡you who walk on the road, pay attention!
6635	7	5	11	‡Hear the sound of those who divide the sheep among the watering places;‡there they tell of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s victorious deeds,‡the victorious deeds of his warriors in Israel.‡Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s people went down to the city gates –
6636	7	5	12	‡Wake up, wake up, Deborah!‡Wake up, wake up, sing a song!‡Get up, Barak!‡Capture your prisoners of war, son of Abinoam!
6637	7	5	13	‡Then the survivors came down to the mighty ones; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s people came down to me as warriors.
6638	7	5	14	‡They came from Ephraim, who uprooted Amalek, ‡they follow after you, Benjamin, with your soldiers.‡From Makir leaders came down,‡from Zebulun came the ones who march carrying an officer’s staff.
6639	7	5	15	‡Issachar’s leaders were with Deborah,‡the men of Issachar supported Barak;‡into the valley they were sent under Barak’s command. ‡Among the clans of Reuben there was intense heart searching.
6640	7	5	16	‡Why do you remain among the sheepfolds, ‡listening to the shepherds playing their pipes for their flocks? ‡As for the clans of Reuben – there was intense searching of heart.
6641	7	5	17	‡Gilead stayed put beyond the Jordan River.‡As for Dan – why did he seek temporary employment in the shipyards? ‡Asher remained on the seacoast,‡he stayed by his harbors.
6642	7	5	18	‡The men of Zebulun were not concerned about their lives; ‡Naphtali charged on to the battlefields.
6643	7	5	19	‡Kings came, they fought;‡the kings of Canaan fought,‡at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, ‡but they took no silver as plunder.
6644	7	5	20	‡From the sky the stars fought,‡from their paths in the heavens they fought against Sisera.

6656	7	6	1	¶The Israelites did evil in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight, so the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> turned them over to Midian for seven years.
6657	7	6	2	The Midianites overwhelmed Israel. Because of Midian the Israelites made shelters for themselves in the hills, as well as caves and strongholds.
6658	7	6	3	Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people from the east would attack them.
6659	7	6	4	They invaded the land and devoured its crops all the way to Gaza. They left nothing for the Israelites to eat, and they took away the sheep, oxen, and donkeys.
6660	7	6	5	When they invaded with their cattle and tents, they were as thick as locusts. Neither they nor their camels could be counted. They came to devour the land.
6661	7	6	6	Israel was so severely weakened by Midian that the Israelites cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for help.
6662	7	6	7	¶When the Israelites cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for help because of Midian,
6663	7	6	8	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent a prophet to the Israelites. He said to them, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said: ‘I brought you up from Egypt and took you out of that place of slavery.
6664	7	6	9	I rescued you from Egypt’s power and from the power of all who oppressed you. I drove them out before you and gave their land to you.
6665	7	6	10	I said to you, “I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God! Do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are now living!” But you have disobeyed me.’”
6666	7	6	11	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel came and sat down under the oak tree in Ophrah owned by Joash the Abiezrite. He arrived while Joash’s son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress so he could hide it from the Midianites.
6667	7	6	12	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel appeared and said to him, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with you, courageous warrior!”
6668	7	6	13	Gideon said to him, “Pardon me, but if the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with us, why has such disaster overtaken us? Where are all his miraculous deeds our ancestors told us about? They said, ‘Did the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> not bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has abandoned us and handed us over to Midian.”
6669	7	6	14	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> himself turned to him and said, “You have the strength. Deliver Israel from the power of the Midianites! Have I not sent you?”
6670	7	6	15	Gideon said to him, “But Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Just look! My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my family.”
6671	7	6	16	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Ah, but I will be with you! You will strike down the whole Midianite army.”
6672	7	6	17	Gideon said to him, “If you really are pleased with me, then give me a sign as proof that it is really you speaking with me.
6673	7	6	18	Do not leave this place until I come back with a gift and present it to you.” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “I will stay here until you come back.”
6674	7	6	19	¶Gideon went and prepared a young goat, along with unleavened bread made from an ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. He brought the food to him under the oak tree and presented it to him.
6675	7	6	20	God’s angel said to him, “Put the meat and unleavened bread on this rock, and pour out the broth.” Gideon did as instructed.
6676	7	6	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of his staff. Fire flared up from the rock and consumed the meat and unleavened bread. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel then disappeared.
6677	7	6	22	¶When Gideon realized that it was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel, he said, “Oh no! Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! I have seen the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel face to face!”
6678	7	6	23	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “You are safe! Do not be afraid! You are not going to die!”
6679	7	6	24	Gideon built an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> there, and named it “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is on friendly terms with me.” To this day it is still there in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
6680	7	6	25	¶That night the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Take the bull from your father’s herd, as well as a second bull, one that is seven years old. Pull down your father’s Baal altar and cut down the nearby Asherah pole.
6681	7	6	26	Then build an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God on the top of this stronghold according to the proper pattern. Take the second bull and offer it as a burnt sacrifice on the wood from the Asherah pole that you cut down.”
6682	7	6	27	So Gideon took ten of his servants and did just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had told him. He was too afraid of his father’s family and the men of the city to do it in broad daylight, so he waited until nighttime.
6683	7	6	28	¶When the men of the city got up the next morning, they saw the Baal altar pulled down, the nearby Asherah pole cut down, and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar.
6684	7	6	29	They said to one another, “Who did this?” They investigated the matter thoroughly and concluded that Gideon son of Joash had done it.
6685	7	6	30	The men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, so we can execute him! He pulled down the Baal altar and cut down the nearby Asherah pole.”
6686	7	6	31	But Joash said to all those who confronted him, “Must you fight Baal’s battles? Must you rescue him? Whoever takes up his cause will die by morning! If he really is a god, let him fight his own battles! After all, it was his altar that was pulled down.”
6687	7	6	32	That very day Gideon’s father named him Jerub-Baal, because he had said, “Let Baal fight with him, for it was his altar that was pulled down.”
6688	7	6	33	¶All the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people from the east assembled. They crossed the Jordan River and camped in the Jezreel Valley.
6689	7	6	34	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit took control of Gideon. He blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.
6690	7	6	35	He sent messengers throughout Manasseh and summoned them to follow him as well. He also sent messengers throughout Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet him.
6691	7	6	36	¶Gideon said to God, “If you really intend to use me to deliver Israel, as you promised, then give me a sign as proof.
6692	7	6	37	Look, I am putting a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and the ground around it is dry, then I will be sure that you will use me to deliver Israel, as you promised.”
6693	7	6	38	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did as he asked. When he got up the next morning, he squeezed the fleece, and enough dew dripped from it to fill a bowl.
6694	7	6	39	Gideon said to God, “Please do not get angry at me, when I ask for just one more sign. Please allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make only the fleece dry, while the ground around it is covered with dew.”
6695	7	6	40	That night God did as he asked. Only the fleece was dry and the ground around it was covered with dew.
6696	7	7	1	¶Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and his men got up the next morning and camped near the spring of Harod. The Midianites were camped north of them near the hill of Moreh in the valley.
6697	7	7	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Gideon, “You have too many men for me to hand Midian over to you. Israel might brag, ‘Our own strength has delivered us.’
6698	7	7	3	Now, announce to the men, ‘Whoever is shaking with fear may turn around and leave Mount Gilead.’” Twenty-two thousand men went home; ten thousand remained.
6699	7	7	4	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Gideon again, “There are still too many men. Bring them down to the water and I will thin the ranks some more. When I say, ‘This one should go with you,’ pick him to go; when I say, ‘This one should not go with you,’ do not take him.”
6700	7	7	5	So he brought the men down to the water. Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Gideon, “Separate those who lap the water as a dog laps from those who kneel to drink.”
6701	7	7	6	Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths; the rest of the men kneeled to drink water.
6702	7	7	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men who lapped I will deliver the whole army and I will hand Midian over to you. The rest of the men should go home.”
6703	7	7	8	The men who were chosen took supplies and their trumpets. Gideon sent all the men of Israel back to their homes; he kept only three hundred men. Now the Midianites were camped down below in the valley.
6704	7	7	9	¶That night the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Gideon, “Get up! Attack the camp, for I am handing it over to you.
6705	7	7	10	But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with Purah your servant
6706	7	7	11	and listen to what they are saying. Then you will be brave and attack the camp.” So he went down with Purah his servant to where the sentries were guarding the camp.
6707	7	7	12	Now the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people from the east covered the valley like a swarm of locusts. Their camels could not be counted; they were as innumerable as the sand on the seashore.
6708	7	7	13	When Gideon arrived, he heard a man telling another man about a dream he had. The man said, “Look! I had a dream. I saw a stale cake of barley bread rolling into the Midianite camp. It hit a tent so hard it knocked it over and turned it upside down. The tent just collapsed.”
6709	7	7	14	The other man said, “Without a doubt this symbolizes the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God is handing Midian and all the army over to him.”
6710	7	7	15	¶When Gideon heard the report of the dream and its interpretation, he praised God. Then he went back to the Israelite camp and said, “Get up, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is handing the Midianite army over to you!”
6711	7	7	16	He divided the three hundred men into three units. He gave them all trumpets and empty jars with torches inside them.
6712	7	7	17	He said to them, “Watch me and do as I do. Watch closely! I am going to the edge of the camp. Do as I do!
6713	7	7	18	When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, you also blow your trumpets all around the camp. Then say, ‘For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and for Gideon!’”
6714	7	7	19	¶Gideon took a hundred men to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guards. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars they were carrying.
6715	7	7	20	All three units blew their trumpets and broke their jars. They held the torches in their left hand and the trumpets in their right. Then they yelled, “A sword for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and for Gideon!”
6716	7	7	21	They stood in order all around the camp. The whole army ran away; they shouted as they scrambled away.
6717	7	7	22	When the three hundred men blew their trumpets, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> caused the Midianites to attack one another with their swords throughout the camp. The army fled to Beth Shittah on the way to Zererah. They went to the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.
6718	7	7	23	Israelites from Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh answered the call and chased the Midianites.
6719	7	7	24	¶Now Gideon sent messengers throughout the Ephraimite hill country who announced, “Go down and head off the Midianites. Take control of the fords of the streams all the way to Beth Barah and the Jordan River.” When all the Ephraimites had assembled, they took control of the fords all the way to Beth Barah and the Jordan River.
6720	7	7	25	They captured the two Midianite generals, Oreb and Zeeb. They executed Oreb on the rock of Oreb and Zeeb in the winepress of Zeeb. They chased the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was now on the other side of the Jordan River.
6721	7	8	1	¶The Ephraimites said to him, “Why have you done such a thing to us? You did not summon us when you went to fight the Midianites!” They argued vehemently with him.
6722	7	8	2	He said to them, “Now what have I accomplished compared to you? Even Ephraim’s leftover grapes are better quality than Abiezer’s harvest!
6723	7	8	3	It was to you that God handed over the Midianite generals, Oreb and Zeeb! What did I accomplish to rival that?” When he said this, they calmed down.
6724	7	8	4	¶Now Gideon and his three hundred men had crossed over the Jordan River, and even though they were exhausted, they were still chasing the Midianites.
6725	7	8	5	He said to the men of Succoth, “Give some loaves of bread to the men who are following me, because they are exhausted. I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
6726	7	8	6	The officials of Succoth said, “You have not yet overpowered Zebah and Zalmunna. So why should we give bread to your army?”
6727	7	8	7	Gideon said, “Since you will not help, after the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hands Zebah and Zalmunna over to me, I will thresh your skin with desert thorns and briers.”
6728	7	8	8	He went up from there to Penuel and made the same request. The men of Penuel responded the same way the men of Succoth had.
6729	7	8	9	He also threatened the men of Penuel, warning, “When I return victoriously, I will tear down this tower.”
6730	7	8	10	¶Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their armies. There were about fifteen thousand survivors from the army of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand sword-wielding soldiers had been killed.
6731	7	8	11	Gideon went up the road of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and ambushed the surprised army.
6732	7	8	12	When Zebah and Zalmunna ran away, Gideon chased them and captured the two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna. He had surprised their entire army.
6733	7	8	13	¶Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the pass of Heres.
6734	7	8	14	He captured a young man from Succoth and interrogated him. The young man wrote down for him the names of Succoth’s officials and city leaders – seventy-seven men in all.
6735	7	8	15	He approached the men of Succoth and said, “Look what I have! Zebah and Zalmunna! You insulted me, saying, ‘You have not yet overpowered Zebah and Zalmunna. So why should we give bread to your exhausted men?’”
6736	7	8	16	He seized the leaders of the city, along with some desert thorns and briers; he then “threshed” the men of Succoth with them.
6737	7	8	17	He also tore down the tower of Penuel and executed the city’s men.
6738	7	8	18	¶He said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “Describe for me the men you killed at Tabor.” They said, “They were like you. Each one looked like a king’s son.”
6739	7	8	19	He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. I swear, as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is alive, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.”
6740	7	8	20	He ordered Jether his firstborn son, “Come on! Kill them!” But Jether was too afraid to draw his sword, because he was still young.
6741	7	8	21	Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, “Come on, you strike us, for a man is judged by his strength.” So Gideon killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent-shaped ornaments which were on the necks of their camels.
6742	7	8	22	¶The men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us – you, your son, and your grandson. For you have delivered us from Midian’s power.”
6743	7	8	23	Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will rule over you.”
6744	7	8	24	Gideon continued, “I would like to make one request. Each of you give me an earring from the plunder you have taken.” (The Midianites had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.)
6745	7	8	25	They said, “We are happy to give you earrings.” So they spread out a garment, and each one threw an earring from his plunder onto it.
6746	7	8	26	The total weight of the gold earrings he requested came to seventeen hundred gold shekels. This was in addition to the crescent-shaped ornaments, jewelry, purple clothing worn by the Midianite kings, and the necklaces on the camels.
6747	7	8	27	Gideon used all this to make an ephod, which he put in his hometown of Ophrah. All the Israelites prostituted themselves to it by worshiping it there. It became a snare to Gideon and his family.
6748	7	8	28	¶The Israelites humiliated Midian; the Midianites’ fighting spirit was broken. The land had rest for forty years during Gideon’s time.
6749	7	8	29	Then Jerub-Baal son of Joash went home and settled down.
6750	7	8	30	Gideon fathered seventy sons through his many wives.
6751	7	8	31	His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also gave him a son, whom he named Abimelech.
6752	7	8	32	Gideon son of Joash died at a very old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash located in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
6753	7	8	33	¶After Gideon died, the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They made Baal-Berith their god.
6754	7	8	34	The Israelites did not remain true to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God, who had delivered them from all the enemies who lived around them.
6755	7	8	35	They did not treat the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) fairly in return for all the good he had done for Israel.
6756	7	9	1	¶Now Abimelech son of Jerub-Baal went to Shechem to see his mother’s relatives. He said to them and to his mother’s entire extended family,
6757	7	9	2	“Tell all the leaders of Shechem this: ‘Why would you want to have seventy men, all Jerub-Baal’s sons, ruling over you, when you can have just one ruler? Recall that I am your own flesh and blood.’”
6758	7	9	3	His mother’s relatives spoke on his behalf to all the leaders of Shechem and reported his proposal. The leaders were drawn to Abimelech; they said, “He is our close relative.”
6759	7	9	4	They paid him seventy silver shekels out of the temple of Baal-Berith. Abimelech then used the silver to hire some lawless, dangerous men as his followers.
6760	7	9	5	He went to his father’s home in Ophrah and murdered his half-brothers, the seventy legitimate sons of Jerub-Baal, on one stone. Only Jotham, Jerub-Baal’s youngest son, escaped, because he hid.
6761	7	9	6	All the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo assembled and then went and made Abimelech king by the oak near the pillar in Shechem.
6762	7	9	7	¶When Jotham heard the news, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim. He spoke loudly to the people below, “Listen to me, leaders of Shechem, so that God may listen to you!
6763	7	9	8	¶“The trees were determined to go out and choose a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Be our king!’
6764	7	9	9	But the olive tree said to them, ‘I am not going to stop producing my oil, which is used to honor gods and men, just to sway above the other trees!’
6765	7	9	10	¶“So the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and be our king!’
6766	7	9	11	But the fig tree said to them, ‘I am not going to stop producing my sweet figs, my excellent fruit, just to sway above the other trees!’
6767	7	9	12	¶“So the trees said to the grapevine, ‘You come and be our king!’
6768	7	9	13	But the grapevine said to them, ‘I am not going to stop producing my wine, which makes gods and men so happy, just to sway above the other trees!’
6769	7	9	14	¶“So all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘You come and be our king!’
6770	7	9	15	The thornbush said to the trees, ‘If you really want to choose me as your king, then come along, find safety under my branches! Otherwise may fire blaze from the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!’
6771	7	9	16	¶“Now, if you have shown loyalty and integrity when you made Abimelech king, if you have done right to Jerub-Baal and his family, if you have properly repaid him –
6772	7	9	17	my father fought for you; he risked his life and delivered you from Midian’s power.
6773	7	9	18	But you have attacked my father’s family today. You murdered his seventy legitimate sons on one stone and made Abimelech, the son of his female slave, king over the leaders of Shechem, just because he is your close relative.
6774	7	9	19	So if you have shown loyalty and integrity to Jerub-Baal and his family today, then may Abimelech bring you happiness and may you bring him happiness!
6775	7	9	20	But if not, may fire blaze from Abimelech and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo! May fire also blaze from the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo and consume Abimelech!”
6776	7	9	21	Then Jotham ran away to Beer and lived there to escape from Abimelech his half-brother.
6777	7	9	22	¶Abimelech commanded Israel for three years.
6778	7	9	23	God sent a spirit to stir up hostility between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem. He made the leaders of Shechem disloyal to Abimelech.
6779	7	9	24	He did this so the violent deaths of Jerub-Baal’s seventy sons might be avenged and Abimelech, their half-brother who murdered them, might have to pay for their spilled blood, along with the leaders of Shechem who helped him murder them.
6780	7	9	25	The leaders of Shechem rebelled against Abimelech by putting bandits in the hills, who robbed everyone who traveled by on the road. But Abimelech found out about it.
6781	7	9	26	¶Gaal son of Ebed came through Shechem with his brothers. The leaders of Shechem transferred their loyalty to him.
6782	7	9	27	They went out to the field, harvested their grapes, squeezed out the juice, and celebrated. They came to the temple of their god and ate, drank, and cursed Abimelech.
6783	7	9	28	Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerub-Baal, and is not Zebul the deputy he appointed? Serve the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem! But why should we serve Abimelech?
6784	7	9	29	If only these men were under my command, I would get rid of Abimelech!” He challenged Abimelech, “Muster your army and come out for battle!”
6785	7	9	30	¶When Zebul, the city commissioner, heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he was furious.
6786	7	9	31	He sent messengers to Abimelech, who was in Arumah, reporting, “Beware! Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers are coming to Shechem and inciting the city to rebel against you.
6787	7	9	32	Now, come up at night with your men and set an ambush in the field outside the city.
6788	7	9	33	In the morning at sunrise quickly attack the city. When he and his men come out to fight you, do what you can to him.”
6789	7	9	34	¶So Abimelech and all his men came up at night and set an ambush outside Shechem – they divided into four units.
6790	7	9	35	When Gaal son of Ebed came out and stood at the entrance to the city’s gate, Abimelech and his men got up from their hiding places.
6791	7	9	36	Gaal saw the men and said to Zebul, “Look, men are coming down from the tops of the hills.” But Zebul said to him, “You are seeing the shadows on the hills – it just looks like men.”
6792	7	9	37	Gaal again said, “Look, men are coming down from the very center of the land. A unit is coming by way of the Oak Tree of the Diviners.”
6793	7	9	38	Zebul said to him, “Where now are your bragging words, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Are these not the men you insulted? Go out now and fight them!”
6794	7	9	39	So Gaal led the leaders of Shechem out and fought Abimelech.
6795	7	9	40	Abimelech chased him, and Gaal ran from him. Many Shechemites fell wounded at the entrance of the gate.
6796	7	9	41	Abimelech went back to Arumah; Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.
6797	7	9	42	¶The next day the Shechemites came out to the field. When Abimelech heard about it,
6798	7	9	43	he took his men and divided them into three units and set an ambush in the field. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he attacked and struck them down.
6799	7	9	44	Abimelech and his units attacked and blocked the entrance to the city’s gate. Two units then attacked all the people in the field and struck them down.
6800	7	9	45	Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed all the people in it. Then he leveled the city and spread salt over it.
6801	7	9	46	¶When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard the news, they went to the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith.
6802	7	9	47	Abimelech heard that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were in one place.
6803	7	9	48	He and all his men went up on Mount Zalmon. He took an ax in his hand and cut off a tree branch. He put it on his shoulder and said to his men, “Quickly, do what you have just seen me do!”
6804	7	9	49	So each of his men also cut off a branch and followed Abimelech. They put the branches against the stronghold and set fire to it. All the people of the Tower of Shechem died – about a thousand men and women.
6805	7	9	50	¶Abimelech moved on to Thebez; he besieged and captured it.
6806	7	9	51	There was a fortified tower in the center of the city, so all the men and women, as well as the city’s leaders, ran into it and locked the entrance. Then they went up to the roof of the tower.
6807	7	9	52	Abimelech came and attacked the tower. When he approached the entrance of the tower to set it on fire,
6808	7	9	53	a woman threw an upper millstone down on his head and shattered his skull.
6809	7	9	54	He quickly called to the young man who carried his weapons, “Draw your sword and kill me, so they will not say, ‘A woman killed him.’” So the young man stabbed him and he died.
6810	7	9	55	When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they went home.
6811	7	9	56	¶God repaid Abimelech for the evil he did to his father by murdering his seventy half-brothers.
6812	7	9	57	God also repaid the men of Shechem for their evil deeds. The curse spoken by Jotham son of Jerub-Baal fell on them.
6813	7	10	1	¶After Abimelech’s death, Tola son of Puah, grandson of Dodo, from the tribe of Issachar, rose up to deliver Israel. He lived in Shamir in the Ephraimite hill country.
6814	7	10	2	He led Israel for twenty-three years, then died and was buried in Shamir.
6815	7	10	3	¶Jair the Gileadite rose up after him; he led Israel for twenty-two years.
6816	7	10	4	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys and possessed thirty cities. To this day these towns are called Havvoth Jair – they are in the land of Gilead.
6817	7	10	5	Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
6818	7	10	6	¶The Israelites again did evil in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight. They worshiped the Baals and the Ashtoreths, as well as the gods of Syria, Sidon, Moab, the Ammonites, and the Philistines. They abandoned the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and did not worship him.
6819	7	10	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was furious with Israel and turned them over to the Philistines and Ammonites.
6820	7	10	8	They ruthlessly oppressed the Israelites that eighteenth year – that is, all the Israelites living east of the Jordan in Amorite country in Gilead.
6821	7	10	9	The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight with Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Israel suffered greatly.
6822	7	10	10	¶The Israelites cried out for help to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: “We have sinned against you. We abandoned our God and worshiped the Baals.”
6823	7	10	11	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to the Israelites, “Did I not deliver you from Egypt, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,
6824	7	10	12	the Sidonians, Amalek, and Midian when they oppressed you? You cried out for help to me, and I delivered you from their power.
6825	7	10	13	But since you abandoned me and worshiped other gods, I will not deliver you again.
6826	7	10	14	Go and cry for help to the gods you have chosen! Let them deliver you from trouble!”
6827	7	10	15	But the Israelites said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “We have sinned. You do to us as you see fit, but deliver us today!”
6828	7	10	16	They threw away the foreign gods they owned and worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Finally the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> grew tired of seeing Israel suffer so much.
6829	7	10	17	¶The Ammonites assembled and camped in Gilead; the Israelites gathered together and camped in Mizpah.
6830	7	10	18	The leaders of Gilead said to one another, “Who is willing to lead the charge against the Ammonites? He will become the leader of all who live in Gilead!”
6831	7	11	1	¶Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a brave warrior. His mother was a prostitute, but Gilead was his father.
6832	7	11	2	Gilead’s wife also gave him sons. When his wife’s sons grew up, they made Jephthah leave and said to him, “You are not going to inherit any of our father’s wealth, because you are another woman’s son.”
6833	7	11	3	So Jephthah left his half-brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Lawless men joined Jephthah’s gang and traveled with him.
6834	7	11	4	¶It was some time after this when the Ammonites fought with Israel.
6835	7	11	5	When the Ammonites attacked, the leaders of Gilead asked Jephthah to come back from the land of Tob.
6836	7	11	6	They said, “Come, be our commander, so we can fight with the Ammonites.”
6837	7	11	7	Jephthah said to the leaders of Gilead, “But you hated me and made me leave my father’s house. Why do you come to me now, when you are in trouble?”
6838	7	11	8	The leaders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That may be true, but now we pledge to you our loyalty. Come with us and fight with the Ammonites. Then you will become the leader of all who live in Gilead.”
6839	7	11	9	Jephthah said to the leaders of Gilead, “All right! If you take me back to fight with the Ammonites and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gives them to me, I will be your leader.”
6840	7	11	10	The leaders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will judge any grievance you have against us, if we do not do as you say.”
6841	7	11	11	So Jephthah went with the leaders of Gilead. The people made him their leader and commander. Jephthah repeated the terms of the agreement before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in Mizpah.
6842	7	11	12	¶Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king, saying, “Why have you come against me to attack my land?”
6843	7	11	13	The Ammonite king said to Jephthah’s messengers, “Because Israel stole my land when they came up from Egypt – from the Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north, and as far west as the Jordan. Now return it peaceably!”
6844	7	11	14	¶Jephthah sent messengers back to the Ammonite king
6845	7	11	15	and said to him, “This is what Jephthah says, ‘Israel did not steal the land of Moab and the land of the Ammonites.
6846	7	11	16	When they left Egypt, Israel traveled through the desert as far as the Red Sea and then came to Kadesh.
6847	7	11	17	Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Please allow us to pass through your land.” But the king of Edom rejected the request. Israel sent the same request to the king of Moab, but he was unwilling to cooperate. So Israel stayed at Kadesh.
6848	7	11	18	Then Israel went through the wilderness and bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab. They traveled east of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon River; they did not go through Moabite territory (the Arnon was Moab’s border).
6849	7	11	19	Israel sent messengers to King Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, “Please allow us to pass through your land to our land.”
6850	7	11	20	But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. He assembled his whole army, camped in Jahaz, and fought with Israel.
6851	7	11	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel handed Sihon and his whole army over to Israel and they defeated them. Israel took all the land of the Amorites who lived in that land.
6852	7	11	22	They took all the Amorite territory from the Arnon River on the south to the Jabbok River on the north, from the desert in the east to the Jordan in the west.
6853	7	11	23	Since the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has driven out the Amorites before his people Israel, do you think you can just take it from them?
6854	7	11	24	You have the right to take what Chemosh your god gives you, but we will take the land of all whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God has driven out before us.
6855	7	11	25	Are you really better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he dare to quarrel with Israel? Did he dare to fight with them?
6856	7	11	26	Israel has been living in Heshbon and its nearby towns, in Aroer and its nearby towns, and in all the cities along the Arnon for three hundred years! Why did you not reclaim them during that time?
6857	7	11	27	I have not done you wrong, but you are doing wrong by attacking me. May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the Judge, judge this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites!’”
6858	7	11	28	But the Ammonite king disregarded the message sent by Jephthah.
6859	7	11	29	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit empowered Jephthah. He passed through Gilead and Manasseh and went to Mizpah in Gilead. From there he approached the Ammonites.
6860	7	11	30	Jephthah made a vow to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, saying, “If you really do hand the Ammonites over to me,
6861	7	11	31	then whoever is the first to come through the doors of my house to meet me when I return safely from fighting the Ammonites – he will belong to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and I will offer him up as a burnt sacrifice.”
6862	7	11	32	Jephthah approached the Ammonites to fight with them, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> handed them over to him.
6863	7	11	33	He defeated them from Aroer all the way to Minnith – twenty cities in all, even as far as Abel Keramim! He wiped them out! The Israelites humiliated the Ammonites.
6864	7	11	34	¶When Jephthah came home to Mizpah, there was his daughter hurrying out to meet him, dancing to the rhythm of tambourines. She was his only child; except for her he had no son or daughter.
6865	7	11	35	When he saw her, he ripped his clothes and said, “Oh no! My daughter! You have completely ruined me! You have brought me disaster! I made an oath to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> and I cannot break it.”
6866	7	11	36	She said to him, “My father, since you made an oath to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, do to me as you promised. After all, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> vindicated you before your enemies, the Ammonites.”
6867	7	11	37	She then said to her father, “Please grant me this one wish. For two months allow me to walk through the hills with my friends and mourn my virginity.”
6868	7	11	38	He said, “You may go.” He permitted her to leave for two months. She went with her friends and mourned her virginity as she walked through the hills.
6869	7	11	39	After two months she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. She died a virgin. Her tragic death gave rise to a custom in Israel.
6870	7	11	40	Every year Israelite women commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four days.
6871	7	12	1	¶The Ephraimites assembled and crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why did you go and fight with the Ammonites without asking us to go with you? We will burn your house down right over you!”
6872	7	12	2	¶Jephthah said to them, “My people and I were in a struggle and the Ammonites were oppressing me greatly. I asked for your help, but you did not deliver me from their power.
6873	7	12	3	When I saw that you were not going to help, I risked my life and advanced against the Ammonites, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> handed them over to me. Why have you come up to fight with me today?”
6874	7	12	4	Jephthah assembled all the men of Gilead and they fought with Ephraim. The men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because the Ephraimites insulted them, saying, “You Gileadites are refugees in Ephraim, living within Ephraim’s and Manasseh’s territory.”
6875	7	12	5	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan River opposite Ephraim. Whenever an Ephraimite fugitive said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead asked him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,”
6876	7	12	6	then they said to him, “Say ‘Shibboleth!’” If he said, “Sibboleth” (and could not pronounce the word correctly), they grabbed him and executed him right there at the fords of the Jordan. On that day forty-two thousand Ephraimites fell dead.
6877	7	12	7	Jephthah led Israel for six years; then he died and was buried in his city in Gilead.
6878	7	12	8	¶After him Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel.
6879	7	12	9	He had thirty sons. He arranged for thirty of his daughters to be married outside his extended family, and he arranged for thirty young women to be brought from outside as wives for his sons. Ibzan led Israel for seven years;
6880	7	12	10	then he died and was buried in Bethlehem.
6881	7	12	11	¶After him Elon the Zebulunite led Israel for ten years.
6882	7	12	12	Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
6883	7	12	13	¶After him Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite led Israel.
6884	7	12	14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys. He led Israel for eight years.
6885	7	12	15	Then Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
6886	7	13	1	¶The Israelites again did evil in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight, so the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> handed them over to the Philistines for forty years.
6887	7	13	2	¶There was a man named Manoah from Zorah, from the Danite tribe. His wife was infertile and childless.
6888	7	13	3	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel appeared to the woman and said to her, “You are infertile and childless, but you will conceive and have a son.
6889	7	13	4	Now be careful! Do not drink wine or beer, and do not eat any food that will make you ritually unclean.
6890	7	13	5	Look, you will conceive and have a son. You must never cut his hair, for the child will be dedicated to God from birth. He will begin to deliver Israel from the power of the Philistines.”
6891	7	13	6	¶The woman went and said to her husband, “A man sent from God came to me! He looked like God’s angel – he was very awesome. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.
6892	7	13	7	He said to me, ‘Look, you will conceive and have a son. So now, do not drink wine or beer and do not eat any food that will make you ritually unclean. For the child will be dedicated to God from birth till the day he dies.’”
6893	7	13	8	¶Manoah prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Please, Lord, allow the man sent from God to visit us again, so he can teach us how we should raise the child who will be born.”
6894	7	13	9	God answered Manoah’s prayer. God’s angel visited the woman again while she was sitting in the field. But her husband Manoah was not with her.
6895	7	13	10	The woman ran at once and told her husband, “Come quickly, the man who visited me the other day has appeared to me!”
6896	7	13	11	So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he met the man, he said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” He said, “Yes.”
6897	7	13	12	Manoah said, “Now, when your announcement comes true, how should the child be raised and what should he do?”
6898	7	13	13	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel told Manoah, “Your wife should pay attention to everything I told her.
6899	7	13	14	She should not drink anything that the grapevine produces. She must not drink wine or beer, and she must not eat any food that will make her ritually unclean. She should obey everything I commanded her to do.”
6900	7	13	15	Manoah said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel, “Please stay here awhile, so we can prepare a young goat for you to eat.”
6901	7	13	16	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel said to Manoah, “If I stay, I will not eat your food. But if you want to make a burnt sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you should offer it.” (He said this because Manoah did not know that he was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel.)
6902	7	13	17	Manoah said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel, “Tell us your name, so we can honor you when your announcement comes true.”
6903	7	13	18	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel said to him, “You should not ask me my name, because you cannot comprehend it.”
6904	7	13	19	Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s messenger did an amazing thing as Manoah and his wife watched.
6905	7	13	20	As the flame went up from the altar toward the sky, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel went up in it while Manoah and his wife watched. They fell facedown to the ground.
6906	7	13	21	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. After all this happened Manoah realized that the visitor had been the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel.
6907	7	13	22	Manoah said to his wife, “We will certainly die, because we have seen a supernatural being!”
6908	7	13	23	But his wife said to him, “If the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> wanted to kill us, he would not have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from us. He would not have shown us all these things, or have spoken to us like this just now.”
6909	7	13	24	¶Manoah’s wife gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The child grew and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> empowered him.
6910	7	13	25	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit began to control him in Mahaneh Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
6911	7	14	1	¶Samson went down to Timnah, where a Philistine girl caught his eye.
6912	7	14	2	When he got home, he told his father and mother, “A Philistine girl in Timnah has caught my eye. Now get her for my wife.”
6913	7	14	3	But his father and mother said to him, “Certainly you can find a wife among your relatives or among all our people! You should not have to go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines.” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, because she is the right one for me.”
6914	7	14	4	Now his father and mother did not realize this was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s doing, because he was looking for an opportunity to stir up trouble with the Philistines (for at that time the Philistines were ruling Israel).
6915	7	14	5	¶Samson went down to Timnah. When he approached the vineyards of Timnah, he saw a roaring young lion attacking him.
6916	7	14	6	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit empowered him and he tore the lion in two with his bare hands as easily as one would tear a young goat. But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.
6917	7	14	7	¶Samson continued on down to Timnah and spoke to the girl. In his opinion, she was just the right one.
6918	7	14	8	Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to see the lion’s remains. He saw a swarm of bees in the lion’s carcass, as well as some honey.
6919	7	14	9	He scooped it up with his hands and ate it as he walked along. When he returned to his father and mother, he offered them some and they ate it. But he did not tell them he had scooped the honey out of the lion’s carcass.
6920	7	14	10	¶Then Samson’s father accompanied him to Timnah for the marriage. Samson hosted a party there, for this was customary for bridegrooms to do.
6921	7	14	11	When the Philistines saw he had no attendants, they gave him thirty groomsmen who kept him company.
6922	7	14	12	Samson said to them, “I will give you a riddle. If you really can solve it during the seven days the party lasts, I will give you thirty linen robes and thirty sets of clothes.
6923	7	14	13	But if you cannot solve it, you will give me thirty linen robes and thirty sets of clothes.” They said to him, “Let us hear your riddle.”
6924	7	14	14	He said to them,‡“Out of the one who eats came something to eat;‡out of the strong one came something sweet.”¶They could not solve the riddle for three days.
6925	7	14	15	¶On the fourth day they said to Samson’s bride, “Trick your husband into giving the solution to the riddle. If you refuse, we will burn up you and your father’s family. Did you invite us here to make us poor?”
6926	7	14	16	So Samson’s bride cried on his shoulder and said, “You must hate me; you do not love me! You told the young men a riddle, but you have not told me the solution.” He said to her, “Look, I have not even told my father or mother. Do you really expect me to tell you?”
6927	7	14	17	She cried on his shoulder until the party was almost over. Finally, on the seventh day, he told her because she had nagged him so much. Then she told the young men the solution to the riddle.
6928	7	14	18	On the seventh day, before the sun set, the men of the city said to him,‡“What is sweeter than honey?‡What is stronger than a lion?”¶He said to them,‡“If you had not plowed with my heifer, ‡you would not have solved my riddle!”
6929	7	14	19	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit empowered him. He went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty men. He took their clothes and gave them to the men who had solved the riddle. He was furious as he went back home.
6930	7	14	20	Samson’s bride was then given to his best man.
6931	7	15	1	¶Sometime later, during the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat as a gift and went to visit his bride. He said to her father, “I want to sleep with my bride in her bedroom!” But her father would not let him enter.
6932	7	15	2	Her father said, “I really thought you absolutely despised her, so I gave her to your best man. Her younger sister is more attractive than she is. Take her instead!”
6933	7	15	3	Samson said to them, “This time I am justified in doing the Philistines harm!”
6934	7	15	4	Samson went and captured three hundred jackals and got some torches. He tied the jackals in pairs by their tails and then tied a torch to each pair.
6935	7	15	5	He lit the torches and set the jackals loose in the Philistines’ standing grain. He burned up the grain heaps and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.
6936	7	15	6	The Philistines asked, “Who did this?” They were told, “Samson, the Timnite’s son-in-law, because the Timnite took Samson’s bride and gave her to his best man.” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father.
6937	7	15	7	Samson said to them, “Because you did this, I will get revenge against you before I quit fighting.”
6938	7	15	8	He struck them down and defeated them. Then he went down and lived for a time in the cave in the cliff of Etam.
6939	7	15	9	¶The Philistines went up and invaded Judah. They arrayed themselves for battle in Lehi.
6940	7	15	10	The men of Judah said, “Why are you attacking us?” The Philistines said, “We have come up to take Samson prisoner so we can do to him what he has done to us.”
6941	7	15	11	Three thousand men of Judah went down to the cave in the cliff of Etam and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? Why have you done this to us?” He said to them, “I have only done to them what they have done to me.”
6942	7	15	12	They said to him, “We have come down to take you prisoner so we can hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson said to them, “Promise me you will not kill me.”
6943	7	15	13	They said to him, “We promise! We will only take you prisoner and hand you over to them. We promise not to kill you.” They tied him up with two brand new ropes and led him up from the cliff.
6944	7	15	14	When he arrived in Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they approached him. But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit empowered him. The ropes around his arms were like flax dissolving in fire, and they melted away from his hands.
6945	7	15	15	He happened to see a solid jawbone of a donkey. He grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.
6946	7	15	16	Samson then said,‡“With the jawbone of a donkey ‡I have left them in heaps; ‡with the jawbone of a donkey ‡I have struck down a thousand men!”
6947	7	15	17	¶When he finished speaking, he threw the jawbone down and named that place Ramath Lehi.
6948	7	15	18	¶He was very thirsty, so he cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and said, “You have given your servant this great victory. But now must I die of thirst and fall into hands of these uncircumcised Philistines?”
6949	7	15	19	So God split open the basin at Lehi and water flowed out from it. When he took a drink, his strength was restored and he revived. For this reason he named the spring En Hakkore. It remains in Lehi to this very day.
6950	7	15	20	Samson led Israel for twenty years during the days of Philistine prominence.
6951	7	16	1	¶Samson went to Gaza. There he saw a prostitute and slept with her.
6952	7	16	2	The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here!” So they surrounded the town and hid all night at the city gate, waiting for him to leave. They relaxed all night, thinking, “He will not leave until morning comes; then we will kill him!”
6953	7	16	3	Samson spent half the night with the prostitute; then he got up in the middle of the night and left. He grabbed the doors of the city gate, as well as the two posts, and pulled them right off, bar and all. He put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of a hill east of Hebron.
6954	7	16	4	¶After this Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the Sorek Valley.
6955	7	16	5	The rulers of the Philistines went up to visit her and said to her, “Trick him! Find out what makes him so strong and how we can subdue him and humiliate him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred silver pieces.”
6956	7	16	6	¶So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me what makes you so strong and how you can be subdued and humiliated.”
6957	7	16	7	Samson said to her, “If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I will become weak and be just like any other man.”
6958	7	16	8	So the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried and she tied him up with them.
6959	7	16	9	They hid in the bedroom and then she said to him, “The Philistines are here, Samson!” He snapped the bowstrings as easily as a thread of yarn snaps when it is put close to fire. The secret of his strength was not discovered.
6960	7	16	10	¶Delilah said to Samson, “Look, you deceived me and told me lies! Now tell me how you can be subdued.”
6961	7	16	11	He said to her, “If they tie me tightly with brand new ropes that have never been used, I will become weak and be just like any other man.”
6962	7	16	12	So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them and said to him, “The Philistines are here, Samson!” (The Philistines were hiding in the bedroom.) But he tore the ropes from his arms as if they were a piece of thread.
6963	7	16	13	¶Delilah said to Samson, “Up to now you have deceived me and told me lies. Tell me how you can be subdued.” He said to her, “If you weave the seven braids of my hair into the fabric on the loom and secure it with the pin, I will become weak and be like any other man.”
6964	7	16	14	So she made him go to sleep, wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric on the loom, fastened it with the pin, and said to him, “The Philistines are here, Samson!” He woke up and tore away the pin of the loom and the fabric.
6965	7	16	15	¶She said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when you will not share your secret with me? Three times you have deceived me and have not told me what makes you so strong.”
6966	7	16	16	She nagged him every day and pressured him until he was sick to death of it.
6967	7	16	17	Finally he told her his secret. He said to her, “My hair has never been cut, for I have been dedicated to God from the time I was conceived. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me; I would become weak, and be just like all other men.”
6968	7	16	18	When Delilah saw that he had told her his secret, she sent for the rulers of the Philistines, saying, “Come up here again, for he has told me his secret.” So the rulers of the Philistines went up to visit her, bringing the silver in their hands.
6969	7	16	19	She made him go to sleep on her lap and then called a man in to shave off the seven braids of his hair. She made him vulnerable and his strength left him.
6970	7	16	20	She said, “The Philistines are here, Samson!” He woke up and thought, “I will do as I did before and shake myself free.” But he did not realize that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had left him.
6971	7	16	21	The Philistines captured him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him in bronze chains. He became a grinder in the prison.
6972	7	16	22	His hair began to grow back after it had been shaved off.
6973	7	16	23	¶The rulers of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate. They said, “Our god has handed Samson, our enemy, over to us.”
6974	7	16	24	When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, “Our god has handed our enemy over to us, the one who ruined our land and killed so many of us!”
6975	7	16	25	¶When they really started celebrating, they said, “Call for Samson so he can entertain us!” So they summoned Samson from the prison and he entertained them. They made him stand between two pillars.
6976	7	16	26	Samson said to the young man who held his hand, “Position me so I can touch the pillars that support the temple. Then I can lean on them.”
6977	7	16	27	Now the temple was filled with men and women, and all the rulers of the Philistines were there. There were three thousand men and women on the roof watching Samson entertain.
6978	7	16	28	Samson called to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, remember me! Strengthen me just one more time, O God, so I can get swift revenge against the Philistines for my two eyes!”
6979	7	16	29	Samson took hold of the two middle pillars that supported the temple and he leaned against them, with his right hand on one and his left hand on the other.
6980	7	16	30	Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He pushed hard and the temple collapsed on the rulers and all the people in it. He killed many more people in his death than he had killed during his life.
6981	7	16	31	His brothers and all his family went down and brought him back. They buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led Israel for twenty years.
6982	7	17	1	¶There was a man named Micah from the Ephraimite hill country.
6983	7	17	2	He said to his mother, “You know the eleven hundred pieces of silver which were stolen from you, about which I heard you pronounce a curse? Look here, I have the silver. I stole it, but now I am giving it back to you.” His mother said, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> reward you, my son!”
6984	7	17	3	When he gave back to his mother the eleven hundred pieces of silver, his mother said, “I solemnly dedicate this silver to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. It will be for my son’s benefit. We will use it to make a carved image and a metal image.”
6985	7	17	4	When he gave the silver back to his mother, she took two hundred pieces of silver to a silversmith, who made them into a carved image and a metal image. She then put them in Micah’s house.
6986	7	17	5	Now this man Micah owned a shrine. He made an ephod and some personal idols and hired one of his sons to serve as a priest.
6987	7	17	6	In those days Israel had no king. Each man did what he considered to be right.
6988	7	17	7	¶There was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah. He was a Levite who had been temporarily residing among the tribe of Judah.
6989	7	17	8	This man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to find another place to live. He came to the Ephraimite hill country and made his way to Micah’s house.
6990	7	17	9	Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” He replied, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I am looking for a new place to live.”
6991	7	17	10	Micah said to him, “Stay with me. Become my adviser and priest. I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, plus clothes and food.”
6992	7	17	11	So the Levite agreed to stay with the man; the young man was like a son to Micah.
6993	7	17	12	Micah paid the Levite; the young man became his priest and lived in Micah’s house.
6994	7	17	13	Micah said, “Now I know the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will make me rich, because I have this Levite as my priest.”
6995	7	18	1	¶In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the Danite tribe was looking for a place to settle, because at that time they did not yet have a place to call their own among the tribes of Israel.
6996	7	18	2	The Danites sent out from their whole tribe five representatives, capable men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it. They said to them, “Go, explore the land.” They came to the Ephraimite hill country and spent the night at Micah’s house.
6997	7	18	3	As they approached Micah’s house, they recognized the accent of the young Levite. So they stopped there and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?”
6998	7	18	4	He told them what Micah had done for him, saying, “He hired me and I became his priest.”
6999	7	18	5	They said to him, “Seek a divine oracle for us, so we can know if we will be successful on our mission.”
7000	7	18	6	The priest said to them, “Go with confidence. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be with you on your mission.”
7001	7	18	7	¶So the five men journeyed on and arrived in Laish. They noticed that the people there were living securely, like the Sidonians do, undisturbed and unsuspecting. No conqueror was troubling them in any way. They lived far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.
7002	7	18	8	When the Danites returned to their tribe in Zorah and Eshtaol, their kinsmen asked them, “How did it go?”
7003	7	18	9	They said, “Come on, let’s attack them, for we saw their land and it is very good. You seem lethargic, but don’t hesitate to invade and conquer the land.
7004	7	18	10	When you invade, you will encounter unsuspecting people. The land is wide! God is handing it over to you – a place that lacks nothing on earth!”
7005	7	18	11	¶So six hundred Danites, fully armed, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.
7006	7	18	12	They went up and camped in Kiriath Jearim in Judah. (To this day that place is called Camp of Dan. It is west of Kiriath Jearim.)
7007	7	18	13	From there they traveled through the Ephraimite hill country and arrived at Micah’s house.
7008	7	18	14	The five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish said to their kinsmen, “Do you realize that inside these houses are an ephod, some personal idols, a carved image, and a metal image? Decide now what you want to do.”
7009	7	18	15	They stopped there, went inside the young Levite’s house (which belonged to Micah), and asked him how he was doing.
7010	7	18	16	Meanwhile the six hundred Danites, fully armed, stood at the entrance to the gate.
7011	7	18	17	The five men who had gone to spy out the land broke in and stole the carved image, the ephod, the personal idols, and the metal image, while the priest was standing at the entrance to the gate with the six hundred fully armed men.
7012	7	18	18	When these men broke into Micah’s house and stole the carved image, the ephod, the personal idols, and the metal image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
7013	7	18	19	They said to him, “Shut up! Put your hand over your mouth and come with us! You can be our adviser and priest. Wouldn’t it be better to be a priest for a whole Israelite tribe than for just one man’s family?”
7014	7	18	20	The priest was happy. He took the ephod, the personal idols, and the carved image and joined the group.
7015	7	18	21	¶They turned and went on their way, but they walked behind the children, the cattle, and their possessions.
7016	7	18	22	After they had gone a good distance from Micah’s house, Micah’s neighbors gathered together and caught up with the Danites.
7017	7	18	23	When they called out to the Danites, the Danites turned around and said to Micah, “Why have you gathered together?”
7018	7	18	24	He said, “You stole my gods that I made, as well as this priest, and then went away. What do I have left? How can you have the audacity to say to me, ‘What do you want?’”
7019	7	18	25	The Danites said to him, “Don’t say another word to us, or some very angry men will attack you, and you and your family will die.”
7020	7	18	26	The Danites went on their way; when Micah realized they were too strong to resist, he turned around and went home.
7021	7	18	27	¶Now the Danites took what Micah had made, as well as his priest, and came to Laish, where the people were undisturbed and unsuspecting. They struck them down with the sword and burned the city.
7022	7	18	28	No one came to the rescue because the city was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and occupied it.
7023	7	18	29	They named it Dan after their ancestor, who was one of Israel’s sons. But the city’s name used to be Laish.
7024	7	18	30	The Danites worshiped the carved image. Jonathan, descendant of Gershom, son of Moses, and his descendants served as priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the exile.
7025	7	18	31	They worshiped Micah’s carved image the whole time God’s authorized shrine was in Shiloh.
7026	7	19	1	¶In those days Israel had no king. There was a Levite living temporarily in the remote region of the Ephraimite hill country. He acquired a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
7027	7	19	2	However, she got angry at him and went home to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah. When she had been there four months,
7028	7	19	3	her husband came after her, hoping he could convince her to return. He brought with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. When she brought him into her father’s house and the girl’s father saw him, he greeted him warmly.
7029	7	19	4	His father-in-law, the girl’s father, persuaded him to stay with him for three days, and they ate and drank together, and spent the night there.
7030	7	19	5	On the fourth day they woke up early and the Levite got ready to leave. But the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, “Have a bite to eat for some energy, then you can go.”
7031	7	19	6	So the two of them sat down and had a meal together. Then the girl’s father said to the man, “Why not stay another night and have a good time!”
7032	7	19	7	When the man got ready to leave, his father-in-law convinced him to stay another night.
7033	7	19	8	He woke up early in the morning on the fifth day so he could leave, but the girl’s father said, “Get some energy. Wait until later in the day to leave!” So they ate a meal together.
7034	7	19	9	When the man got ready to leave with his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, “Look! The day is almost over! Stay another night! Since the day is over, stay another night here and have a good time. You can get up early tomorrow and start your trip home.”
7035	7	19	10	But the man did not want to stay another night. He left and traveled as far as Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a pair of saddled donkeys and his concubine.
7036	7	19	11	¶When they got near Jebus, it was getting quite late and the servant said to his master, “Come on, let’s stop at this Jebusite city and spend the night in it.”
7037	7	19	12	But his master said to him, “We should not stop at a foreign city where non-Israelites live. We will travel on to Gibeah.”
7038	7	19	13	He said to his servant, “Come on, we will go into one of the other towns and spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah.”
7039	7	19	14	So they traveled on, and the sun went down when they were near Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin.
7040	7	19	15	They stopped there and decided to spend the night in Gibeah. They came into the city and sat down in the town square, but no one invited them to spend the night.
7041	7	19	16	¶But then an old man passed by, returning at the end of the day from his work in the field. The man was from the Ephraimite hill country; he was living temporarily in Gibeah. (The residents of the town were Benjaminites.)
7042	7	19	17	When he looked up and saw the traveler in the town square, the old man said, “Where are you heading? Where do you come from?”
7043	7	19	18	The Levite said to him, “We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote region of the Ephraimite hill country. That’s where I’m from. I had business in Bethlehem in Judah, but now I’m heading home. But no one has invited me into their home.
7044	7	19	19	We have enough straw and grain for our donkeys, and there is enough food and wine for me, your female servant, and the young man who is with your servants. We lack nothing.”
7045	7	19	20	The old man said, “Everything is just fine! I will take care of all your needs. But don’t spend the night in the town square.”
7046	7	19	21	So he brought him to his house and fed the donkeys. They washed their feet and had a meal.
7047	7	19	22	¶They were having a good time, when suddenly some men of the city, some good-for-nothings, surrounded the house and kept beating on the door. They said to the old man who owned the house, “Send out the man who came to visit you so we can take carnal knowledge of him.”
7048	7	19	23	The man who owned the house went outside and said to them, “No, my brothers! Don’t do this wicked thing! After all, this man is a guest in my house. Don’t do such a disgraceful thing!
7049	7	19	24	Here are my virgin daughter and my guest’s concubine. I will send them out and you can abuse them and do to them whatever you like. But don’t do such a disgraceful thing to this man!”
7050	7	19	25	The men refused to listen to him, so the Levite grabbed his concubine and made her go outside. They raped her and abused her all night long until morning. They let her go at dawn.
7051	7	19	26	The woman arrived back at daybreak and was sprawled out on the doorstep of the house where her master was staying until it became light.
7052	7	19	27	When her master got up in the morning, opened the doors of the house, and went outside to start on his journey, there was the woman, his concubine, sprawled out on the doorstep of the house with her hands on the threshold.
7053	7	19	28	He said to her, “Get up, let’s leave!” But there was no response. He put her on the donkey and went home.
7054	7	19	29	When he got home, he took a knife, grasped his concubine, and carved her up into twelve pieces. Then he sent the pieces throughout Israel.
7055	7	19	30	Everyone who saw the sight said, “Nothing like this has happened or been witnessed during the entire time since the Israelites left the land of Egypt! Take careful note of it! Discuss it and speak!”
7056	7	20	1	¶All the Israelites from Dan to Beer Sheba and from the land of Gilead left their homes and assembled together before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at Mizpah.
7057	7	20	2	The leaders of all the people from all the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of God’s people, which numbered four hundred thousand sword-wielding foot soldiers.
7058	7	20	3	The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah. Then the Israelites said, “Explain how this wicked thing happened!”
7059	7	20	4	The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, spoke up, “I and my concubine stopped in Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin to spend the night.
7060	7	20	5	The leaders of Gibeah attacked me and at night surrounded the house where I was staying. They wanted to kill me; instead they abused my concubine so badly that she died.
7061	7	20	6	I took hold of my concubine and carved her up and sent the pieces throughout the territory occupied by Israel, because they committed such an unthinkable atrocity in Israel.
7062	7	20	7	All you Israelites, make a decision here!”
7063	7	20	8	¶All Israel rose up in unison and said, “Not one of us will go home! Not one of us will return to his house!
7064	7	20	9	Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: We will attack the city as the lot dictates.
7065	7	20	10	We will take ten of every group of a hundred men from all the tribes of Israel (and a hundred of every group of a thousand, and a thousand of every group of ten thousand) to get supplies for the army. When they arrive in Gibeah of Benjamin they will punish them for the atrocity which they committed in Israel.”
7066	7	20	11	So all the men of Israel gathered together at the city as allies.
7067	7	20	12	¶The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “How could such a wicked thing take place?
7068	7	20	13	Now, hand over the good-for-nothings in Gibeah so we can execute them and purge Israel of wickedness.” But the Benjaminites refused to listen to their Israelite brothers.
7069	7	20	14	The Benjaminites came from their cities and assembled at Gibeah to make war against the Israelites.
7070	7	20	15	That day the Benjaminites mustered from their cities twenty-six thousand sword-wielding soldiers, besides seven hundred well-trained soldiers from Gibeah.
7071	7	20	16	Among this army were seven hundred specially-trained left-handed soldiers. Each one could sling a stone and hit even the smallest target.
7072	7	20	17	The men of Israel (not counting Benjamin) had mustered four hundred thousand sword-wielding soldiers, every one an experienced warrior.
7073	7	20	18	¶The Israelites went up to Bethel and asked God, “Who should lead the charge against the Benjaminites?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Judah should lead.”
7074	7	20	19	The Israelites got up the next morning and moved against Gibeah.
7075	7	20	20	The men of Israel marched out to fight Benjamin; they arranged their battle lines against Gibeah.
7076	7	20	21	The Benjaminites attacked from Gibeah and struck down twenty-two thousand Israelites that day.
7077	7	20	22	¶The Israelite army took heart and once more arranged their battle lines, in the same place where they had taken their positions the day before.
7078	7	20	23	The Israelites went up and wept before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> until evening. They asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Should we again march out to fight the Benjaminites, our brothers?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Attack them!”
7079	7	20	24	So the Israelites marched toward the Benjaminites the next day.
7080	7	20	25	The Benjaminites again attacked them from Gibeah and struck down eighteen thousand sword-wielding Israelite soldiers.
7081	7	20	26	¶So all the Israelites, the whole army, went up to Bethel. They wept and sat there before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; they did not eat anything that day until evening. They offered up burnt sacrifices and tokens of peace to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7082	7	20	27	The Israelites asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> (for the ark of God’s covenant was there in those days;
7083	7	20	28	Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, was serving the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in those days), “Should we once more march out to fight the Benjaminites our brothers, or should we quit?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Attack, for tomorrow I will hand them over to you.”
7084	7	20	29	¶So Israel hid men in ambush outside Gibeah.
7085	7	20	30	The Israelites attacked the Benjaminites the next day; they took their positions against Gibeah just as they had done before.
7086	7	20	31	The Benjaminites attacked the army, leaving the city unguarded. They began to strike down their enemy just as they had done before. On the main roads (one leads to Bethel, the other to Gibeah) and in the field, they struck down about thirty Israelites.
7087	7	20	32	Then the Benjaminites said, “They are defeated just as before.” But the Israelites said, “Let’s retreat and lure them away from the city into the main roads.”
7088	7	20	33	All the men of Israel got up from their places and took their positions at Baal Tamar, while the Israelites hiding in ambush jumped out of their places west of Gibeah.
7089	7	20	34	Ten thousand men, well-trained soldiers from all Israel, then made a frontal assault against Gibeah – the battle was fierce. But the Benjaminites did not realize that disaster was at their doorstep.
7090	7	20	35	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> annihilated Benjamin before Israel; the Israelites struck down that day 25,100 sword-wielding Benjaminites.
7091	7	20	36	Then the Benjaminites saw they were defeated.¶The Israelites retreated before Benjamin, because they had confidence in the men they had hid in ambush outside Gibeah.
7092	7	20	37	The men hiding in ambush made a mad dash to Gibeah. They attacked and put the sword to the entire city.
7093	7	20	38	The Israelites and the men hiding in ambush had arranged a signal. When the men hiding in ambush sent up a smoke signal from the city,
7094	7	20	39	the Israelites counterattacked. Benjamin had begun to strike down the Israelites; they struck down about thirty men. They said, “There’s no doubt about it! They are totally defeated as in the earlier battle.”
7095	7	20	40	But when the signal, a pillar of smoke, began to rise up from the city, the Benjaminites turned around and saw the whole city going up in a cloud of smoke that rose high into the sky.
7096	7	20	41	When the Israelites turned around, the Benjaminites panicked because they could see that disaster was on their doorstep.
7097	7	20	42	They retreated before the Israelites, taking the road to the wilderness. But the battle overtook them as men from the surrounding cities struck them down.
7098	7	20	43	They surrounded the Benjaminites, chased them from Nohah, and annihilated them all the way to a spot east of Geba.
7099	7	20	44	Eighteen thousand Benjaminites, all of them capable warriors, fell dead.
7100	7	20	45	The rest turned and ran toward the wilderness, heading toward the cliff of Rimmon. But the Israelites caught five thousand of them on the main roads. They stayed right on their heels all the way to Gidom and struck down two thousand more.
7101	7	20	46	That day twenty-five thousand sword-wielding Benjaminites fell in battle, all of them capable warriors.
7102	7	20	47	Six hundred survivors turned and ran away to the wilderness, to the cliff of Rimmon. They stayed there four months.
7103	7	20	48	The Israelites returned to the Benjaminite towns and put the sword to them. They wiped out the cities, the animals, and everything they could find. They set fire to every city in their path.
7104	7	21	1	¶The Israelites had taken an oath in Mizpah, saying, “Not one of us will allow his daughter to marry a Benjaminite.”
7105	7	21	2	So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, weeping loudly and uncontrollably.
7106	7	21	3	They said, “Why, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, has this happened in Israel?” An entire tribe has disappeared from Israel today!”
7107	7	21	4	¶The next morning the people got up early and built an altar there. They offered up burnt sacrifices and tokens of peace.
7108	7	21	5	The Israelites asked, “Who from all the Israelite tribes has not assembled before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?”They had made a solemn oath that whoever did not assemble before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at Mizpah must certainly be executed.
7109	7	21	6	The Israelites regretted what had happened to their brother Benjamin. They said, “Today we cut off an entire tribe from Israel!
7110	7	21	7	How can we find wives for those who are left? After all, we took an oath in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s name not to give them our daughters as wives.”
7111	7	21	8	So they asked, “Who from all the Israelite tribes did not assemble before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at Mizpah?” Now it just so happened no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the gathering.
7112	7	21	9	When they took roll call, they noticed none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead were there.
7113	7	21	10	So the assembly sent 12,000 capable warriors against Jabesh Gilead. They commanded them, “Go and kill with your swords the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead, including the women and little children.
7114	7	21	11	Do this: exterminate every male, as well as every woman who has experienced a man’s bed. But spare the lives of any virgins.” So they did as instructed.
7115	7	21	12	They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young girls who were virgins who had never been intimate with a man in bed. They brought them back to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
7116	7	21	13	¶The entire assembly sent messengers to the Benjaminites at the cliff of Rimmon and assured them they would not be harmed.
7117	7	21	14	The Benjaminites returned at that time, and the Israelites gave to them the women they had spared from Jabesh Gilead. But there were not enough to go around.
7118	7	21	15	¶The people regretted what had happened to Benjamin because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had weakened the Israelite tribes.
7119	7	21	16	The leaders of the assembly said, “How can we find wives for those who are left? After all, the Benjaminite women have been wiped out.
7120	7	21	17	The remnant of Benjamin must be preserved. An entire Israelite tribe should not be wiped out.
7121	7	21	18	But we can’t allow our daughters to marry them, for the Israelites took an oath, saying, ‘Whoever gives a woman to a Benjaminite will be destroyed!’
7122	7	21	19	However, there is an annual festival to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel (east of the main road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem) and south of Lebonah.”
7123	7	21	20	So they commanded the Benjaminites, “Go hide in the vineyards,
7124	7	21	21	and keep your eyes open. When you see the daughters of Shiloh coming out to dance in the celebration, jump out from the vineyards. Each one of you, catch yourself a wife from among the daughters of Shiloh and then go home to the land of Benjamin.
7125	7	21	22	When their fathers or brothers come and protest to us, we’ll say to them, “Do us a favor and let them be, for we could not get each one a wife through battle. Don’t worry about breaking your oath! You would only be guilty if you had voluntarily given them wives.’”
7126	7	21	23	¶The Benjaminites did as instructed. They abducted two hundred of the dancing girls to be their wives. They went home to their own territory, rebuilt their cities, and settled down.
7127	7	21	24	Then the Israelites dispersed from there to their respective tribal and clan territories. Each went from there to his own property.
7128	7	21	25	In those days Israel had no king. Each man did what he considered to be right.
7129	8	1	1	¶During the time of the judges there was a famine in the land of Judah. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah went to live as a resident foreigner in the region of Moab, along with his wife and two sons.
7130	8	1	2	(Now the man’s name was Elimelech, his wife was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were of the clan of Ephrath from Bethlehem in Judah.) They entered the region of Moab and settled there.
7131	8	1	3	Sometime later Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, so she and her two sons were left alone.
7132	8	1	4	So her sons married Moabite women.<sup></sup> (One was named Orpah and the other Ruth.) And they continued to live there about ten years.
7133	8	1	5	Then Naomi’s two sons, Mahlon and Kilion, also died. So the woman was left all alone – bereaved of her two children as well as her husband!
7134	8	1	6	So she decided to return home from the region of Moab, accompanied by her daughters-in-law, because while she was living in Moab she had heard that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had shown concern for his people, reversing the famine by providing abundant crops.
7135	8	1	7	¶Now as she and her two daughters-in-law began to leave the place where she had been living to return to the land of Judah,
7136	8	1	8	Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Listen to me! Each of you should return to your mother’s home! May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> show you the same kind of devotion that you have shown to your deceased husbands and to me!
7137	8	1	9	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> enable each of you to find security in the home of a new husband!” Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept loudly.
7138	8	1	10	But they said to her, “No! We will return with you to your people.”
7139	8	1	11	¶But Naomi replied, “Go back home, my daughters! There is no reason for you to return to Judah with me! I am no longer capable of giving birth to sons who might become your husbands!
7140	8	1	12	Go back home, my daughters! For I am too old to get married again. Even if I thought that there was hope that I could get married tonight and conceive sons,
7141	8	1	13	surely you would not want to wait until they were old enough to marry! Surely you would not remain unmarried all that time! No, my daughters, you must not return with me. For my intense suffering is too much for you to bear. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is afflicting me!”
7142	8	1	14	¶Again they wept loudly. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung tightly to her.
7143	8	1	15	So Naomi said, “Look, your sister-in-law is returning to her people and to her god. Follow your sister-in-law back home!”
7144	8	1	16	But Ruth replied, ‡“Stop urging me to abandon you! ‡For wherever you go, I will go.‡Wherever you live, I will live.‡Your people will become my people,‡and your God will become my God.
7145	8	1	17	‡Wherever you die, I will die – and there I will be buried.‡May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> punish me severely if I do not keep my promise! ‡Only death will be able to separate me from you!”
7146	8	1	18	¶When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to dissuade her.
7147	8	1	19	So the two of them journeyed together until they arrived in Bethlehem. ¶When they entered Bethlehem, the whole village was excited about their arrival. The women of the village said, “Can this be Naomi?”
7148	8	1	20	But she replied to them, “Don’t call me ‘Naomi’! Call me ‘Mara’ because the Sovereign One has treated me very harshly.
7149	8	1	21	I left here full, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has caused me to return empty-handed. Why do you call me ‘Naomi,’ seeing that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has opposed me, and the Sovereign One has caused me to suffer?”
7150	8	1	22	So Naomi returned, accompanied by her Moabite daughter-in-law Ruth, who came back with her from the region of Moab. (Now they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.)
7151	8	2	1	¶Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side of the family named Boaz. He was a wealthy, prominent man from the clan of Elimelech.
7152	8	2	2	One day Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields so I can gather grain behind whoever permits me to do so.” Naomi replied, “You may go, my daughter.”
7153	8	2	3	So Ruth went and gathered grain in the fields behind the harvesters. Now she just happened to end up in the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.
7154	8	2	4	¶Now at that very moment, Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> be with you!” They replied, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> bless you!”
7155	8	2	5	Boaz asked his servant in charge of the harvesters, “To whom does this young woman belong?”
7156	8	2	6	The servant in charge of the harvesters replied, “She’s the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the region of Moab.
7157	8	2	7	She asked, ‘May I follow the harvesters and gather grain among the bundles?’ Since she arrived she has been working hard from this morning until now – except for sitting in the resting hut a short time.”
7158	8	2	8	¶So Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen carefully, my dear! Do not leave to gather grain in another field. You need not go beyond the limits of this field. You may go along beside my female workers.
7159	8	2	9	Take note of the field where the men are harvesting and follow behind with the female workers. I will tell the men to leave you alone. When you are thirsty, you may go to the water jars and drink some of the water the servants draw.”
7160	8	2	10	¶Ruth knelt before him with her forehead to the ground and said to him, “Why are you so kind and so attentive to me, even though I am a foreigner?”
7161	8	2	11	Boaz replied to her, “I have been given a full report of all that you have done for your mother-in-law following the death of your husband – how you left your father and your mother, as well as your homeland, and came to live among people you did not know previously.
7162	8	2	12	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> reward your efforts! May your acts of kindness be repaid fully by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, from whom you have sought protection!”
7163	8	2	13	She said, “You really are being kind to me, sir, for you have reassured and encouraged me, your servant, even though I will never be like one of your servants!”
7164	8	2	14	¶Later during the mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here and have some food! Dip your bread in the vinegar!” So she sat down beside the harvesters. Then he handed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was full and saved the rest.
7165	8	2	15	When she got up to gather grain, Boaz told his male servants, “Let her gather grain even among the bundles! Don’t chase her off!
7166	8	2	16	Make sure you pull out ears of grain for her and drop them so she can gather them up. Don’t tell her not to!”
7167	8	2	17	So she gathered grain in the field until evening. When she threshed what she had gathered, it came to about thirty pounds of barley!
7168	8	2	18	¶She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much grain she had gathered. Then Ruth gave her the roasted grain she had saved from mealtime.
7169	8	2	19	Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you gather grain today? Where did you work? May the one who took notice of you be rewarded!” So Ruth told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked. She said, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.”
7170	8	2	20	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be rewarded by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> because he has shown loyalty to the living on behalf of the dead!” Then Naomi said to her, “This man is a close relative of ours; he is our guardian.”
7171	8	2	21	Ruth the Moabite replied, “He even told me, ‘You may go along beside my servants until they have finished gathering all my harvest!’”
7172	8	2	22	Naomi then said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, “It is good, my daughter, that you should go out to work with his female servants. That way you will not be harmed, which could happen in another field.”
7173	8	2	23	So Ruth worked beside Boaz’s female servants, gathering grain until the end of the barley harvest as well as the wheat harvest. After that she stayed home with her mother-in-law.
7174	8	3	1	¶At that time, Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, “My daughter, I must find a home for you so you will be secure.
7175	8	3	2	Now Boaz, with whose female servants you worked, is our close relative. Look, tonight he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor.
7176	8	3	3	So bathe yourself, rub on some perfumed oil, and get dressed up. Then go down to the threshing floor. But don’t let the man know you’re there until he finishes his meal.
7177	8	3	4	When he gets ready to go to sleep, take careful notice of the place where he lies down. Then go, uncover his legs, and lie down beside him. He will tell you what you should do.”
7178	8	3	5	Ruth replied to Naomi, “I will do everything you have told me to do.”
7179	8	3	6	¶So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do.
7180	8	3	7	When Boaz had finished his meal and was feeling satisfied, he lay down to sleep at the far end of the grain heap. Then Ruth crept up quietly, uncovered his legs, and lay down beside him.
7181	8	3	8	In the middle of the night he was startled and turned over. Now he saw a woman lying beside him!
7182	8	3	9	He said, “Who are you?” She replied, “I am Ruth, your servant. Marry your servant, for you are a guardian of the family interests.”
7183	8	3	10	He said, “May you be rewarded by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, my dear! This act of devotion is greater than what you did before. For you have not sought to marry one of the young men, whether rich or poor.
7184	8	3	11	Now, my dear, don’t worry! I intend to do for you everything you propose, for everyone in the village knows that you are a worthy woman.
7185	8	3	12	Now yes, it is true that I am a guardian, but there is another guardian who is a closer relative than I am.
7186	8	3	13	Remain here tonight. Then in the morning, if he agrees to marry you, fine, let him do so. But if he does not want to do so, I promise, as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, to marry you. Sleep here until morning.”
7187	8	3	14	So she slept beside him until morning. She woke up while it was still dark. Boaz thought, “No one must know that a woman visited the threshing floor.”
7188	8	3	15	Then he said, “Hold out the shawl you are wearing and grip it tightly.” As she held it tightly, he measured out about sixty pounds of barley into the shawl and put it on her shoulders. Then he went into town,
7189	8	3	16	and she returned to her mother-in-law. ¶When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “How did things turn out for you, my daughter?” Ruth told her about all the man had done for her.
7190	8	3	17	She said, “He gave me these sixty pounds of barley, for he said to me, ‘Do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’”
7191	8	3	18	Then Naomi said, “Stay put, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out. For the man will not rest until he has taken care of the matter today.”
7192	8	4	1	¶Now Boaz went up to the village gate and sat there. Then along came the guardian whom Boaz had mentioned to Ruth! Boaz said, “Come here, what’s-your-name, and sit down.” So he came and sat down.
7193	8	4	2	Boaz chose ten of the village leaders and said, “Sit down here!” So they sat down.
7194	8	4	3	Then Boaz said to the guardian, “Naomi, who has returned from the region of Moab, is selling the portion of land that belongs to our relative Elimelech.
7195	8	4	4	So I am legally informing you: Acquire it before those sitting here and before the leaders of my people! If you want to exercise your right to redeem it, then do so. But if not, then tell me so I will know. For you possess the first option to redeem it; I am next in line after you.” He replied, “I will redeem it.”
7196	8	4	5	Then Boaz said, “When you acquire the field from Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the wife of our deceased relative, in order to preserve his family name by raising up a descendant who will inherit his property.”
7197	8	4	6	The guardian said, “Then I am unable to redeem it, for I would ruin my own inheritance in that case. You may exercise my redemption option, for I am unable to redeem it.”
7198	8	4	7	(Now this used to be the customary way to finalize a transaction involving redemption in Israel: A man would remove his sandal and give it to the other party. This was a legally binding act in Israel.)
7199	8	4	8	So the guardian said to Boaz, “You may acquire it,” and he removed his sandal.
7200	8	4	9	Then Boaz said to the leaders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I have acquired from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon.
7201	8	4	10	I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, as my wife to raise up a descendant who will inherit his property so the name of the deceased might not disappear from among his relatives and from his village. You are witnesses today.”
7202	8	4	11	All the people who were at the gate and the elders replied, “We are witnesses. May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> make the woman who is entering your home like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built up the house of Israel! May you prosper in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem.
7203	8	4	12	May your family become like the family of Perez – whom Tamar bore to Judah – through the descendants the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gives you by this young woman.”
7204	8	4	13	¶So Boaz married Ruth and slept with her. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> enabled her to conceive and she gave birth to a son.
7205	8	4	14	The village women said to Naomi, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> be praised because he has not left you without a guardian today! May he become famous in Israel!
7206	8	4	15	He will encourage you and provide for you when you are old, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, has given him birth. She is better to you than seven sons!”
7207	8	4	16	Naomi took the child and placed him on her lap; she became his caregiver.
7208	8	4	17	The neighbor women named him, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi.” They named him Obed. Now he became the father of Jesse – David’s father!
7209	8	4	18	¶These are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,
7210	8	4	19	Hezron was the father of Ram, Ram was the father of Amminadab,
7211	8	4	20	Amminadab was the father of Nachshon, Nachshon was the father of Salmah,
7212	8	4	21	Salmon was the father of Boaz, Boaz was the father of Obed,
7213	8	4	22	Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of David.
7214	9	1	1	¶There was a man from Ramathaim Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim. His name was Elkanah. He was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
7215	9	1	2	He had two wives; the name of the first was Hannah and the name of the second was Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
7216	9	1	3	This man would go up from his city year after year to worship and to sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies at Shiloh. (It was there that the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, served as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s priests.)
7217	9	1	4	The day came and Elkanah sacrificed. ¶(Now he used to give meat portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.
7218	9	1	5	But to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, although the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had not enabled her to have children.
7219	9	1	6	Her rival used to aggravate her to the point of exasperation, just to irritate her, since the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had not enabled her to have children.
7220	9	1	7	This is how it would go year after year. As often as she went up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s house, Peninnah would offend her that way.) ¶So she cried and refused to eat.
7221	9	1	8	Then her husband Elkanah said to her, “Hannah, why are you crying and why won’t you eat? Why are you so upset? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”
7222	9	1	9	So Hannah got up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. ¶At the time Eli the priest was sitting in his chair by the doorpost of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sanctuary.
7223	9	1	10	As for her, she was very distressed. She prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and was, in fact, weeping.
7224	9	1	11	She made a vow saying, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, if you would truly look on the suffering of your servant, and would keep me in mind and not neglect your servant, and give your servant a male child, then I will dedicate him to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> all the days of his life. His hair will never be cut.”
7225	9	1	12	¶It turned out that she did a great deal of praying before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Meanwhile Eli was watching her mouth.
7226	9	1	13	As for Hannah, she was speaking in her mind. Only her lips were moving; her voice could not be heard. So Eli thought she was a drunkard.
7227	9	1	14	¶Then he said to her, “How much longer do you intend to get drunk? Put away your wine!”
7228	9	1	15	But Hannah replied, “Not so, my lord! I am a woman under a great deal of stress. I haven’t drunk wine or beer. But I have poured out my soul before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7229	9	1	16	Don’t consider your servant a wicked woman. It’s just that, to this point, I have spoken from my deep pain and anguish.”
7230	9	1	17	¶Eli replied, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant the request that you have asked of him.”
7231	9	1	18	She said, “May I, your servant, find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and got something to eat. Her face no longer looked sad.
7232	9	1	19	¶They got up early the next morning. Then they worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and returned to their home at Ramathaim. Elkanah was intimate with his wife Hannah, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> called her to mind.
7233	9	1	20	Then Hannah became pregnant. ¶In the course of time she gave birth to a son. And she named him Samuel, thinking, “I asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for him.”
7234	9	1	21	Then the man Elkanah and all his family went up to make the yearly sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and to keep his vow.
7235	9	1	22	But Hannah did not go up with them, because she had told her husband, “Not until the boy is weaned. Then I will bring him so that he may appear before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. And he will remain there from then on.”
7236	9	1	23	¶Then her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what you think best. Stay until you have weaned him. Only may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> fulfill his promise.” ¶So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.
7237	9	1	24	Then she took him up with her as soon as she had weaned him, along with three bulls, an ephah of flour, and a container of wine. She came to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s house at Shiloh, and the boy was with them.
7238	9	1	25	They slaughtered the bull, then brought the boy to Eli.
7239	9	1	26	She said, “My lord. Just as surely as you are alive, my lord, I am the woman who previously stood here with you in order to pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7240	9	1	27	For this boy I prayed, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given me the request that I asked of him.
7241	9	1	28	So I also dedicate him to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. For all the days of his life he is dedicated to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”Then he bowed down there in worship to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7242	9	2	1	¶Hannah prayed, ‡“My heart has rejoiced in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡my horn has been raised high because of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡I have loudly denounced my enemies.‡Indeed I rejoice in your deliverance.
7243	9	2	2	‡No one is holy like the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!‡There is no one other than you!‡There is no rock like our God!
7244	9	2	3	‡Don’t keep speaking so arrogantly. ‡Proud talk should not come out of your mouth!‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is a God who knows;‡he evaluates what people do.
7245	9	2	4	‡The bows of warriors are shattered,‡but those who stumbled have taken on strength.
7246	9	2	5	‡The well-fed hire themselves out to earn food,‡but the hungry no longer lack. ‡Even the barren woman has given birth to seven, ‡but the one with many children has declined.
7247	9	2	6	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> both kills and gives life;‡he brings down to the grave and raises up.
7248	9	2	7	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> impoverishes and makes wealthy;‡he humbles and he exalts.
7249	9	2	8	‡He lifts the weak from the dust;‡he raises the poor from the ash heap‡to seat them with princes–‡he bestows on them an honored position. ‡The foundations of the earth belong to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>–‡he placed the world on them.
7250	9	2	9	‡He watches over his holy ones, ‡but the wicked are made speechless in the darkness, ‡for it is not by one’s own strength that one prevails.
7251	9	2	10	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> shatters his adversaries; ‡he thunders against them from the heavens.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> executes judgment to the ends of the earth.‡He will strengthen his king‡and exalt the power of his anointed one.”
7252	9	2	11	¶Then Elkanah went back home to Ramah. ¶The boy was serving the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with the favor of Eli the priest.
7253	9	2	12	But the sons of Eli were wicked men. They did not acknowledge the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s authority.
7254	9	2	13	This was the priests’ routine with the people. Whenever anyone was making a sacrifice, the priest’s attendant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand, just as the meat was boiling.
7255	9	2	14	He would jab it into the basin, kettle, cauldron, or pot. Everything that the fork would bring up the priest would take for himself. This is how they used to treat all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.
7256	9	2	15	¶Also, before they burned the fat the priest’s attendant would come and say to the person who was making the sacrifice, “Give some meat for the priest to roast! He won’t accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”
7257	9	2	16	If the individual said to him, “They should certainly burn the fat away first, then take for yourself whatever you wish,” he would say, “No! Give it now! If not, I’ll take it by force!”
7258	9	2	17	The sin of these young men was very great in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight, for they treated the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s offering with contempt.
7259	9	2	18	¶Now Samuel was ministering with the favor of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The boy was dressed in a linen ephod.
7260	9	2	19	His mother used to make him a small robe and bring it up to him from time to time when she would go up with her husband to make the annual sacrifice.
7261	9	2	20	Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife saying, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> establish descendants for you from this woman in place of the one that she dedicated to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”Then they would go to their home.
7262	9	2	21	And indeed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> attended to Hannah. She got pregnant and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. But the boy Samuel grew up before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7263	9	2	22	¶Eli was very old. And he would hear about everything that his sons used to do to all the people of Israel and how they used to go to bed with the women who were stationed at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
7264	9	2	23	So he said to them, “Why do you do these things, these evil things which I hear about from all these people?
7265	9	2	24	No, my sons! For the report that I hear circulating among the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s people is not good.
7266	9	2	25	If a man sins against a man, one may appeal to God on his behalf. But if a man sins against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who can intercede for him then?” But Eli’s sons would not listen to their father. Indeed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had decided to kill them.
7267	9	2	26	However, the boy Samuel was growing up and finding favor both with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and with people.
7268	9	2	27	¶Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: ‘I plainly revealed myself to your ancestor’s house when they were slaves to the house of Pharaoh in Egypt.
7269	9	2	28	I chose your ancestor from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer sacrifice on my altar, to burn incense, and to bear the ephod before me. I gave to your ancestor’s house all the fire offerings made by the Israelites.
7270	9	2	29	Why are you scorning my sacrifice and my offering that I commanded for my dwelling place? You have honored your sons more than you have me by having made yourselves fat from the best parts of all the offerings of my people Israel.’
7271	9	2	30	¶Therefore the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says, ‘I really did say that your house and your ancestor’s house would serve me forever.’ But now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘May it never be! For I will honor those who honor me, but those who despise me will be cursed!
7272	9	2	31	In fact, days are coming when I will remove your strength and the strength of your father’s house. There will not be an old man in your house!
7273	9	2	32	You will see trouble in my dwelling place! Israel will experience blessings, but there will not be an old man in your house for all time.
7274	9	2	33	Any man of yours that I do not cut off from my altar, I will cause his eyes to fail and will cause him grief. All of those born to your family will die by the sword of man.
7275	9	2	34	This will be a confirming sign for you that will be fulfilled through your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: in a single day they both will die!
7276	9	2	35	Then I will raise up for myself a faithful priest. He will do what is in my heart and soul. I will build for him a lasting dynasty and he will serve my chosen one for all time.
7277	9	2	36	Everyone who remains in your house will come to bow before him for a little money and for a scrap of bread. Each will say, ‘Assign me to a priestly task so I can eat a scrap of bread.’”
7278	9	3	1	¶Now the boy Samuel continued serving the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> under Eli’s supervision. Receiving a message from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was rare in those days; revelatory visions were infrequent.
7279	9	3	2	¶Eli’s eyes had begun to fail, so that he was unable to see well. At that time he was lying down in his place,
7280	9	3	3	and the lamp of God had not yet been extinguished. Samuel was lying down in the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as well; the ark of God was also there.
7281	9	3	4	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> called to Samuel, and he replied, “Here I am!”
7282	9	3	5	Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli said, “I didn’t call you. Go back and lie down.” So he went back and lay down.
7283	9	3	6	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> again called, “Samuel!” So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli said, “I didn’t call you, my son. Go back and lie down.”
7284	9	3	7	¶Now Samuel did not yet know the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s messages had not yet been revealed to him.
7285	9	3	8	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> called Samuel a third time. So he got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me!” Eli then realized that it was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who was calling the boy.
7286	9	3	9	So Eli said to Samuel, “Go back and lie down. When he calls you, say, “Speak, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for your servant is listening.” So Samuel went back and lay down in his place.
7287	9	3	10	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came and stood nearby, calling as he had previously done, “Samuel! Samuel!” Samuel replied, “Speak, for your servant is listening!”
7288	9	3	11	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Look! I am about to do something in Israel; when anyone hears about it, both of his ears will tingle.
7289	9	3	12	On that day I will carry out against Eli everything that I spoke about his house – from start to finish!
7290	9	3	13	You should tell him that I am about to judge his house forever because of the sin that he knew about. For his sons were cursing God, and he did not rebuke them.
7291	9	3	14	Therefore I swore an oath to the house of Eli, ‘The sin of the house of Eli can never be forgiven by sacrifice or by grain offering.’”
7292	9	3	15	¶So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.
7293	9	3	16	However, Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” He replied, “Here I am.”
7294	9	3	17	Eli said, “What message did he speak to you? Don’t conceal it from me. God will judge you severely if you conceal from me anything that he said to you!”
7295	9	3	18	¶So Samuel told him everything. He did not hold back anything from him. Eli said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will do what he pleases.”
7296	9	3	19	Samuel continued to grow, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with him. None of his prophecies fell to the ground unfulfilled.
7297	9	3	20	All Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba realized that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7298	9	3	21	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> again appeared in Shiloh, for it was in Shiloh that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had revealed himself to Samuel through a message from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7299	9	4	1	Samuel revealed the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to all Israel.¶Then the Israelites went out to fight the Philistines. They camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines camped at Aphek.
7300	9	4	2	The Philistines arranged their forces to fight Israel. As the battle spread out, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men in the battle line in the field.
7301	9	4	3	¶When the army came back to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why did the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> let us be defeated today by the Philistines? Let’s take with us the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from Shiloh. When it is with us, it will save us from the hand of our enemies.”
7302	9	4	4	¶So the army sent to Shiloh, and they took from there the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, who sits between the cherubim. Now the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
7303	9	4	5	When the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> arrived at the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly that the ground shook.
7304	9	4	6	¶When the Philistines heard the sound of the shout, they said, “What is this loud shout in the camp of the Hebrews?” Then they realized that the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had arrived at the camp.
7305	9	4	7	The Philistines were scared because they thought that gods had come to the camp. They said, “Woe to us! We’ve never seen anything like this!
7306	9	4	8	Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all sorts of plagues in the desert!
7307	9	4	9	Be strong and act like men, you Philistines, or else you will wind up serving the Hebrews the way they have served you! Act like men and fight!”
7308	9	4	10	¶So the Philistines fought. Israel was defeated; they all ran home. The slaughter was very great; thirty thousand foot soldiers from Israel fell in battle.
7309	9	4	11	The ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, were killed.
7310	9	4	12	¶On that day a Benjaminite ran from the battle lines and came to Shiloh. His clothes were torn and dirt was on his head.
7311	9	4	13	When he arrived in Shiloh, Eli was sitting in his chair on the lookout by the side of the road, for he was very worried about the ark of God. As the man entered the city to give his report, the whole city cried out.
7312	9	4	14	¶When Eli heard the outcry, he said, “What is this commotion?” The man quickly came and told Eli.
7313	9	4	15	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes looked straight ahead; he was unable to see.
7314	9	4	16	¶The man said to Eli, “I am the one who came from the battle lines! Just today I fled from the battle lines!” Eli asked, “How did things go, my son?”
7315	9	4	17	The messenger replied, “Israel has fled from the Philistines! The army has suffered a great defeat! Your two sons, Hophni and Phineas, are dead! The ark of God has been captured!”
7316	9	4	18	¶When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward from his chair beside the gate. He broke his neck and died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for forty years.
7317	9	4	19	¶His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phineas, was pregnant and close to giving birth. When she heard that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she doubled over and gave birth. But her labor pains were too much for her.
7318	9	4	20	As she was dying, the women who were there with her said, “Don’t be afraid! You have given birth to a son!” But she did not reply or pay any attention.
7319	9	4	21	¶She named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” referring to the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.
7320	9	4	22	She said, “The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God has been captured.”
7321	9	5	1	¶Now the Philistines had captured the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
7322	9	5	2	The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the temple of Dagon, where they positioned it beside Dagon.
7323	9	5	3	When the residents of Ashdod got up early the next day, Dagon was lying on the ground before the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. So they took Dagon and set him back in his place.
7324	9	5	4	But when they got up early the following day, Dagon was again lying on the ground before the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The head of Dagon and his two hands were sheared off and were lying at the threshold. Only Dagon’s body was left intact.
7325	9	5	5	(For this reason, to this very day, neither Dagon’s priests nor anyone else who enters Dagon’s temple step on Dagon’s threshold in Ashdod.)
7326	9	5	6	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> attacked the residents of Ashdod severely, bringing devastation on them. He struck the people of both Ashdod and the surrounding area with sores.
7327	9	5	7	When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel should not remain with us, for he has attacked both us and our god Dagon!”
7328	9	5	8	¶So they assembled all the leaders of the Philistines and asked, “What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They replied, “The ark of the God of Israel should be moved to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.
7329	9	5	9	¶But after it had been moved the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> attacked that city as well, causing a great deal of panic. He struck all the people of that city with sores.
7330	9	5	10	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. ¶But when the ark of God arrived at Ekron, the residents of Ekron cried out saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel here to kill our people!”
7331	9	5	11	So they assembled all the leaders of the Philistines and said, “Get the ark of the God of Israel out of here! Let it go back to its own place so that it won’t kill us and our people!” The terror of death was throughout the entire city; God was attacking them very severely there.
7332	9	5	12	The people who did not die were struck with sores; the city’s cry for help went all the way up to heaven.
7333	9	6	1	¶When the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had been in the land of the Philistines for seven months,
7334	9	6	2	the Philistines called the priests and the omen readers, saying, “What should we do with the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>? Advise us as to how we should send it back to its place.”
7335	9	6	3	¶They replied, “If you are going to send the ark of the God of Israel back, don’t send it away empty. Be sure to return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why his hand is not removed from you.”
7336	9	6	4	They inquired, “What is the guilt offering that we should send to him?” ¶They replied, “The Philistine leaders number five. So send five gold sores and five gold mice, for it is the same plague that has afflicted both you and your leaders.
7337	9	6	5	You should make images of the sores and images of the mice that are destroying the land. You should honor the God of Israel. Perhaps he will release his grip on you, your gods, and your land.
7338	9	6	6	Why harden your hearts like the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When God treated them harshly, didn’t the Egyptians send the Israelites on their way?
7339	9	6	7	So now go and make a new cart. Get two cows that have calves and that have never had a yoke placed on them. Harness the cows to the cart and take their calves from them back to their stalls.
7340	9	6	8	Then take the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and place it on the cart, and put in a chest beside it the gold objects you are sending to him as a guilt offering. You should then send it on its way.
7341	9	6	9	But keep an eye on it. If it should go up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has brought this great calamity on us. But if that is not the case, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us; rather, it just happened to us by accident.”
7342	9	6	10	¶So the men did as instructed. They took two cows that had calves and harnessed them to a cart; they also removed their calves to their stalls.
7343	9	6	11	They put the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on the cart, along with the chest, the gold mice, and the images of the sores.
7344	9	6	12	Then the cows went directly on the road to Beth Shemesh. They went along that route, bellowing more and more; they turned neither to the right nor to the left. The leaders of the Philistines were walking along behind them all the way to the border of Beth Shemesh.
7345	9	6	13	¶Now the residents of Beth Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the ark, they were pleased at the sight.
7346	9	6	14	The cart was coming to the field of Joshua, who was from Beth Shemesh. It paused there near a big stone. Then they cut up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7347	9	6	15	The Levites took down the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and the chest that was with it, which contained the gold objects. They placed them near the big stone. At that time the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7348	9	6	16	The five leaders of the Philistines watched what was happening and then returned to Ekron on the same day.
7349	9	6	17	¶These are the gold sores that the Philistines brought as a guilt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – one for each of the following cities: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.
7350	9	6	18	The gold mice corresponded in number to all the Philistine cities of the five leaders, from the fortified cities to hamlet villages, to greater Abel, where they positioned the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> until this very day in the field of Joshua who was from Beth Shemesh.
7351	9	6	19	¶But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> struck down some of the people of Beth Shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; he struck down 50,070 of the men. The people grieved because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had struck the people with a hard blow.
7352	9	6	20	The residents of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who is able to stand before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?”
7353	9	6	21	¶So they sent messengers to the residents of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Come down here and take it back home with you.”
7354	9	7	1	¶Then the people of Kiriath Jearim came and took the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord;</span> they brought it to the house of Abinadab located on the hill. They consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7355	9	7	2	¶It was quite a long time – some twenty years in all – that the ark stayed at Kiriath Jearim. All the people of Israel longed for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7356	9	7	3	Samuel said to all the people of Israel, “If you are really turning to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with all your hearts, remove from among you the foreign gods and the images of Ashtoreth. Give your hearts to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and serve only him. Then he will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”
7357	9	7	4	So the Israelites removed the Baals and images of Ashtoreth. They served only the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7358	9	7	5	¶Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on your behalf.”
7359	9	7	6	After they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They fasted on that day, and they confessed there, “We have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”So Samuel led the people of Israel at Mizpah.
7360	9	7	7	¶When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the leaders of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the Israelites heard about this, they were afraid of the Philistines.
7361	9	7	8	The Israelites said to Samuel, “Keep crying out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God so that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines!”
7362	9	7	9	So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Samuel cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on Israel’s behalf, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answered him.
7363	9	7	10	¶As Samuel was offering burnt offerings, the Philistines approached to do battle with Israel. But on that day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> thundered loudly against the Philistines. He caused them to panic, and they were defeated by Israel.
7364	9	7	11	Then the men of Israel left Mizpah and chased the Philistines, striking them down all the way to an area below Beth Car.
7365	9	7	12	¶Samuel took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Up to here the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has helped us.”
7366	9	7	13	So the Philistines were defeated; they did not invade Israel again. The hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
7367	9	7	14	¶The cities that the Philistines had captured from Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekron to Gath. Israel also delivered their territory from the control of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.
7368	9	7	15	So Samuel led Israel all the days of his life.
7369	9	7	16	Year after year he used to travel the circuit of Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; he used to judge Israel in all of these places.
7370	9	7	17	Then he would return to Ramah, because his home was there. He also judged Israel there and built an altar to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> there.
7371	9	8	1	¶In his old age Samuel appointed his sons as judges over Israel.
7372	9	8	2	The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beer Sheba.
7373	9	8	3	But his sons did not follow his ways. Instead, they made money dishonestly, accepted bribes, and perverted justice.
7374	9	8	4	¶So all the elders of Israel gathered together and approached Samuel at Ramah.
7375	9	8	5	They said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons don’t follow your ways. So now appoint over us a king to lead us, just like all the other nations have.”
7376	9	8	6	¶But this request displeased Samuel, for they said, “Give us a king to lead us.” So Samuel prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7377	9	8	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Do everything the people request of you. For it is not you that they have rejected, but it is me that they have rejected as their king.
7378	9	8	8	Just as they have done from the day that I brought them up from Egypt until this very day, they have rejected me and have served other gods. This is what they are also doing to you.
7379	9	8	9	So now do as they say. But you must warn them and make them aware of the policies of the king who will rule over them.”
7380	9	8	10	¶So Samuel spoke all of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s</span> words to the people who were asking him for a king.
7381	9	8	11	He said, “Here are the policies of the king who will rule over you: He will conscript your sons and put them in his chariot forces and in his cavalry; they will run in front of his chariot.
7382	9	8	12	He will appoint for himself leaders of thousands and leaders of fifties, as well as those who plow his ground, reap his harvest, and make his weapons of war and his chariot equipment.
7383	9	8	13	He will take your daughters to be ointment makers, cooks, and bakers.
7384	9	8	14	He will take your best fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his own servants.
7385	9	8	15	He will demand a tenth of your seed and of the produce of your vineyards and give it to his administrators and his servants.
7386	9	8	16	He will take your male and female servants, as well as your best cattle and your donkeys, and assign them for his own use.
7387	9	8	17	He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will be his servants.
7388	9	8	18	In that day you will cry out because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> won’t answer you in that day.”
7389	9	8	19	¶But the people refused to heed Samuel’s warning. Instead they said, “No! There will be a king over us!
7390	9	8	20	We will be like all the other nations. Our king will judge us and lead us and fight our battles.”
7391	9	8	21	¶So Samuel listened to everything the people said and then reported it to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7392	9	8	22	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Do as they say and install a king over them.” Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Each of you go back to his own city.”
7393	9	9	1	¶There was a Benjaminite man named Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. He was a prominent person.
7394	9	9	2	He had a son named Saul, a handsome young man. There was no one among the Israelites more handsome than he was; he stood head and shoulders above all the people.
7395	9	9	3	¶The donkeys of Saul’s father Kish wandered off, so Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go look for the donkeys.”
7396	9	9	4	So Saul crossed through the hill country of Ephraim, passing through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. So they crossed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then he crossed through the land of Benjamin, and still they did not find them.
7397	9	9	5	¶When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come on, let’s head back before my father quits worrying about the donkeys and becomes anxious about us!”
7398	9	9	6	But the servant said to him, “Look, there is a man of God in this town. He is highly respected. Everything that he says really happens. Now let’s go there. Perhaps he will tell us where we should go from here.”
7399	9	9	7	So Saul said to his servant, “All right, we can go. But what can we bring the man, since the food in our bags is used up? We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?”
7400	9	9	8	The servant went on to answer Saul, “Look, I happen to have in my hand a quarter shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God and he will tell us where we should go.”
7401	9	9	9	(Now it used to be in Israel that whenever someone went to inquire of God he would say, “Come on, let’s go to the seer.” For today’s prophet used to be called a seer.)
7402	9	9	10	So Saul said to his servant, “That’s a good idea! Come on. Let’s go.” So they went to the town where the man of God was.
7403	9	9	11	¶As they were going up the ascent to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water. They said to them, “Is this where the seer is?”
7404	9	9	12	They replied, “Yes, straight ahead! But hurry now, for he came to the town today, and the people are making a sacrifice at the high place.
7405	9	9	13	When you enter the town, you can find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people won’t eat until he arrives, for he must bless the sacrifice. Once that happens, those who have been invited will eat. Now go on up, for this is the time when you can find him!”
7406	9	9	14	¶So they went up to the town. As they were heading for the middle of the town, Samuel was coming in their direction to go up to the high place.
7407	9	9	15	Now the day before Saul arrived, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had told Samuel:
7408	9	9	16	“At this time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin. You must consecrate him as a leader over my people Israel. He will save my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked with favor on my people. Their cry has reached me!”
7409	9	9	17	¶When Samuel saw Saul, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Here is the man that I told you about! He will rule over my people.”
7410	9	9	18	As Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate, he said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”
7411	9	9	19	¶Samuel replied to Saul, “I am the seer! Go up in front of me to the high place! Today you will eat with me and in the morning I will send you away. I will tell you everything that you are thinking.
7412	9	9	20	Don’t be concerned about the donkeys that you lost three days ago, for they have been found. Whom does all Israel desire? Is it not you, and all your father’s family?”
7413	9	9	21	¶Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of Israel’s tribes, and is not my family clan the smallest of all the clans in the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you speak to me in this way?”
7414	9	9	22	¶Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the room and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited. There were about thirty people present.
7415	9	9	23	Samuel said to the cook, “Give me the portion of meat that I gave to you – the one I asked you to keep with you.”
7416	9	9	24	¶So the cook picked up the leg and brought it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, “What was kept is now set before you! Eat, for it has been kept for you for this meeting time, from the time I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
7417	9	9	25	¶When they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof.
7418	9	9	26	They got up at dawn and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up, so I can send you on your way.” So Saul got up and the two of them – he and Samuel – went outside.
7419	9	9	27	While they were going down to the edge of town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” So he did. Samuel then said, “You remain here awhile, so I can inform you of God’s message.”
7420	9	10	1	¶Then Samuel took a small container of olive oil and poured it on Saul’s head. Samuel kissed him and said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has chosen you to lead his people Israel! You will rule over the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s people and you will deliver them from the power of the enemies who surround them. This will be your sign that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has chosen you as leader over his inheritance.
7421	9	10	2	When you leave me today, you will find two men near Rachel’s tomb at Zelzah on Benjamin’s border. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you have gone looking for have been found. Your father is no longer concerned about the donkeys but has become anxious about you two! He is asking, “What should I do about my son?”’
7422	9	10	3	¶“As you continue on from there, you will come to the tall tree of Tabor. At that point three men who are going up to God at Bethel will meet you. One of them will be carrying three young goats, one of them will be carrying three round loaves of bread, and one of them will be carrying a container of wine.
7423	9	10	4	They will ask you how you’re doing and will give you two loaves of bread. You will accept them.
7424	9	10	5	Afterward you will go to Gibeah of God, where there are Philistine officials. When you enter the town, you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place. They will have harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres, and they will be prophesying.
7425	9	10	6	Then the Spirit of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will rush upon you and you will prophesy with them. You will be changed into a different person.
7426	9	10	7	¶“When these signs have taken place, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God will be with you.
7427	9	10	8	You will go down to Gilgal before me. I am going to join you there to offer burnt offerings and to make peace offerings. You should wait for seven days, until I arrive and tell you what to do.”
7428	9	10	9	¶As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed his inmost person. All these signs happened on that very day.
7429	9	10	10	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a company of prophets was coming out to meet him. Then the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul and he prophesied among them.
7430	9	10	11	When everyone who had known him previously saw him prophesying with the prophets, the people all asked one another, “What on earth has happened to the son of Kish? Does even Saul belong with the prophets?”
7431	9	10	12	¶A man who was from there replied, “And who is their father?” Therefore this became a proverb: “Is even Saul among the prophets?”
7432	9	10	13	When Saul had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.
7433	9	10	14	¶Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where did you go?” Saul replied, “To look for the donkeys. But when we realized they were lost, we went to Samuel.”
7434	9	10	15	Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”
7435	9	10	16	Saul said to his uncle, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But Saul did not tell him what Samuel had said about the matter of kingship.
7436	9	10	17	¶Then Samuel called the people together before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at Mizpah.
7437	9	10	18	He said to the Israelites, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said, ‘I brought Israel up from Egypt and I delivered you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.
7438	9	10	19	But today you have rejected your God who saves you from all your trouble and distress. You have said, “No! Appoint a king over us.” Now take your positions before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by your tribes and by your clans.’”
7439	9	10	20	¶Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen by lot.
7440	9	10	21	Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the family of Matri was chosen by lot. At last Saul son of Kish was chosen by lot. But when they looked for him, he was nowhere to be found.
7441	9	10	22	So they inquired again of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Has the man arrived here yet?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “He has hidden himself among the equipment.”
7442	9	10	23	¶So they ran and brought him from there. When he took his position among the people, he stood head and shoulders above them all.
7443	9	10	24	Then Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has chosen? Indeed, there is no one like him among all the people!” All the people shouted out, “Long live the king!”
7444	9	10	25	¶Then Samuel talked to the people about how the kingship would work. He wrote it all down on a scroll and set it before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Then Samuel sent all the people away to their homes.
7445	9	10	26	Even Saul went to his home in Gibeah. With him went some brave men whose hearts God had touched.
7446	9	10	27	But some wicked men said, “How can this man save us?” They despised him and did not even bring him a gift. But Saul said nothing about it.
7447	9	11	1	¶Nahash the Ammonite marched against Jabesh Gilead. All the men of Jabesh Gilead said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us and we will serve you.”
7448	9	11	2	¶But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “The only way I will make a treaty with you is if you let me gouge out the right eye of every one of you and in so doing humiliate all Israel!”
7449	9	11	3	¶The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Leave us alone for seven days so that we can send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. If there is no one who can deliver us, we will come out voluntarily to you.”
7450	9	11	4	¶When the messengers went to Gibeah (where Saul lived) and informed the people of these matters, all the people wept loudly.
7451	9	11	5	Now Saul was walking behind the oxen as he came from the field. Saul asked, “What has happened to the people? Why are they weeping?” So they told him about the men of Jabesh.
7452	9	11	6	¶The Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and he became very angry.
7453	9	11	7	He took a pair of oxen and cut them up. Then he sent the pieces throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, who said, “Whoever does not go out after Saul and after Samuel should expect this to be done to his oxen!” Then the terror of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> fell on the people, and they went out as one army.
7454	9	11	8	When Saul counted them at Bezek, the Israelites were 300,000 strong and the men of Judah numbered 30,000.
7455	9	11	9	¶They said to the messengers who had come, “Here’s what you should say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow deliverance will come to you when the sun is fully up.’” When the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh Gilead, they were happy.
7456	9	11	10	The men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you and you can do with us whatever you wish.”
7457	9	11	11	¶The next day Saul placed the people in three groups. They went to the Ammonite camp during the morning watch and struck them down until the hottest part of the day. The survivors scattered; no two of them remained together.
7458	9	11	12	¶Then the people said to Samuel, “Who were the ones asking, ‘Will Saul reign over us?’ Hand over those men so we may execute them!”
7459	9	11	13	But Saul said, “No one will be killed on this day. For today the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given Israel a victory!”
7460	9	11	14	Samuel said to the people, “Come on! Let’s go to Gilgal and renew the kingship there.”
7461	9	11	15	So all the people went to Gilgal, where they established Saul as king in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence. They offered up peace offerings there in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence. Saul and all the Israelites were very happy.
7462	9	12	1	¶Samuel said to all Israel, “I have done everything you requested. I have given you a king.
7463	9	12	2	Now look! This king walks before you. As for me, I am old and gray, though my sons are here with you. I have walked before you from the time of my youth till the present day.
7464	9	12	3	Here I am. Bring a charge against me before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and before his chosen king. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I wronged? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I taken a bribe so that I would overlook something? Tell me, and I will return it to you!”
7465	9	12	4	¶They replied, “You have not wronged us or oppressed us. You have not taken anything from the hand of anyone.”
7466	9	12	5	He said to them, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is witness against you, and his chosen king is witness this day, that you have not found any reason to accuse me.” They said, “He is witness!”
7467	9	12	6	¶Samuel said to the people, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the one who chose Moses and Aaron and who brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt.
7468	9	12	7	Now take your positions, so I may confront you before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> regarding all the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s just actions toward you and your ancestors.
7469	9	12	8	When Jacob entered Egypt, your ancestors cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent Moses and Aaron, and they led your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
7470	9	12	9	¶“But they forgot the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God, so he gave them into the hand of Sisera, the general in command of Hazor’s army, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
7471	9	12	10	Then they cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and admitted, ‘We have sinned, for we have forsaken the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and have served the Baals and the images of Ashtoreth. Now deliver us from the hand of our enemies so that we may serve you.’
7472	9	12	11	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent Jerub-Baal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel, and he delivered you from the hand of the enemies all around you, and you were able to live securely.
7473	9	12	12	¶“When you saw that King Nahash of the Ammonites was advancing against you, you said to me, ‘No! A king will rule over us’ – even though the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is your king!
7474	9	12	13	Now look! Here is the king you have chosen – the one that you asked for! Look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given you a king!
7475	9	12	14	If you fear the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, serving him and obeying him and not rebelling against what he says, and if both you and the king who rules over you follow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, all will be well.
7476	9	12	15	But if you don’t obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and rebel against what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, the hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be against both you and your king.
7477	9	12	16	¶“So now, take your positions and watch this great thing that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is about to do in your sight.
7478	9	12	17	Is this not the time of the wheat harvest? I will call on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> so that he makes it thunder and rain. Realize and see what a great sin you have committed before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by asking for a king for yourselves.”
7479	9	12	18	¶So Samuel called to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made it thunder and rain that day. All the people were very afraid of both the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and Samuel.
7480	9	12	19	All the people said to Samuel, “Pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God on behalf of us – your servants – so we won’t die, for we have added to all our sins by asking for a king.”
7481	9	12	20	¶Then Samuel said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. You have indeed sinned. However, don’t turn aside from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with all your heart.
7482	9	12	21	You should not turn aside after empty things that can’t profit and can’t deliver, since they are empty.
7483	9	12	22	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will not abandon his people because he wants to uphold his great reputation. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was pleased to make you his own people.
7484	9	12	23	As far as I am concerned, far be it from me to sin against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by ceasing to pray for you! I will instruct you in the way that is good and upright.
7485	9	12	24	However, fear the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and serve him faithfully with all your heart. Just look at the great things he has done for you!
7486	9	12	25	But if you continue to do evil, both you and your king will be swept away.”
7487	9	13	1	¶Saul was [thirty] years old when he began to reign; he ruled over Israel for [forty] years.
7488	9	13	2	Saul selected for himself three thousand men from Israel. Two thousand of these were with Saul at Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel; the remaining thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin. He sent all the rest of the people back home.
7489	9	13	3	¶Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost that was at Geba and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul alerted all the land saying, “Let the Hebrews pay attention!”
7490	9	13	4	All Israel heard this message, “Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel is repulsive to the Philistines!” So the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
7491	9	13	5	¶Meanwhile the Philistines gathered to battle with Israel. Then they went up against Israel with 3,000 chariots , 6,000 horsemen, and an army as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven.
7492	9	13	6	The men of Israel realized they had a problem because their army was hard pressed. So the army hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, strongholds, and cisterns.
7493	9	13	7	Some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan River to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul stayed at Gilgal; the entire army that was with him was terrified.
7494	9	13	8	He waited for seven days, the time period indicated by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the army began to abandon Saul.
7495	9	13	9	¶So Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” Then he offered a burnt offering.
7496	9	13	10	Just when he had finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared on the scene. Saul went out to meet him and to greet him.
7497	9	13	11	¶But Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul replied, “When I saw that the army had started to abandon me and that you didn’t come at the appointed time and that the Philistines had assembled at Micmash,
7498	9	13	12	I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal and I have not sought the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s favor.’ So I felt obligated to offer the burnt offering.”
7499	9	13	13	¶Then Samuel said to Saul, “You have made a foolish choice! You have not obeyed the commandment that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God gave you. Had you done that, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> would have established your kingdom over Israel forever!
7500	9	13	14	But now your kingdom will not continue! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sought out for himself a man who is loyal to him and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has appointed him to be leader over his people, for you have not obeyed what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded you.”
7501	9	13	15	¶Then Samuel set out and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin. Saul mustered the army that remained with him; there were about six hundred men.
7502	9	13	16	Saul, his son Jonathan, and the army that remained with them stayed in Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped in Micmash.
7503	9	13	17	Raiding bands went out from the camp of the Philistines in three groups. One band turned toward the road leading to Ophrah by the land of Shual;
7504	9	13	18	another band turned toward the road leading to Beth Horon; and yet another band turned toward the road leading to the border that overlooks the valley of Zeboim in the direction of the desert.
7505	9	13	19	¶A blacksmith could not be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, “This will prevent the Hebrews from making swords and spears.”
7506	9	13	20	So all Israel had to go down to the Philistines in order to get their plowshares, cutting instruments, axes, and sickles sharpened.
7507	9	13	21	They charged two-thirds of a shekel to sharpen plowshares and cutting instruments, and a third of a shekel to sharpen picks and axes, and to set ox goads.
7508	9	13	22	So on the day of the battle no sword or spear was to be found in the hand of anyone in the army that was with Saul and Jonathan. No one but Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
7509	9	13	23	¶A garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash.
7510	9	14	1	Then one day Jonathan son of Saul said to his armor bearer, “Come on, let’s go over to the Philistine garrison that is opposite us.” But he did not let his father know.
7511	9	14	2	¶Now Saul was sitting under a pomegranate tree in Migron, on the outskirts of Gibeah. The army that was with him numbered about six hundred men.
7512	9	14	3	Now Ahijah was carrying an ephod. He was the son of Ahitub, who was the brother of Ichabod and a son of Phineas, son of Eli, the priest of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in Shiloh. The army was unaware that Jonathan had left.
7513	9	14	4	¶Now there was a steep cliff on each side of the pass through which Jonathan intended to go to reach the Philistine garrison. One cliff was named Bozez, the other Seneh.
7514	9	14	5	The cliff to the north was closer to Micmash, the one to the south closer to Geba.
7515	9	14	6	¶Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come on, let’s go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will intervene for us. Nothing can prevent the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from delivering, whether by many or by a few.”
7516	9	14	7	His armor bearer said to him, “Do everything that is on your mind. Do as you’re inclined. I’m with you all the way!”
7517	9	14	8	¶Jonathan replied, “All right! We’ll go over to these men and fight them.
7518	9	14	9	If they say to us, ‘Stay put until we approach you,’ we will stay right there and not go up to them.
7519	9	14	10	But if they say, ‘Come up against us,’ we will go up. For in that case the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given them into our hand – it will be a sign to us.”
7520	9	14	11	¶When they made themselves known to the Philistine garrison, the Philistines said, “Look! The Hebrews are coming out of the holes in which they hid themselves.”
7521	9	14	12	Then the men of the garrison said to Jonathan and his armor bearer, “Come on up to us so we can teach you a thing or two!” Then Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up behind me, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given them into the hand of Israel!”
7522	9	14	13	¶Jonathan crawled up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer following behind him. Jonathan struck down the Philistines, while his armor bearer came along behind him and killed them.
7523	9	14	14	In this initial skirmish Jonathan and his armor bearer struck down about twenty men in an area that measured half an acre.
7524	9	14	15	¶Then fear overwhelmed those who were in the camp, those who were in the field, all the army in the garrison, and the raiding bands. They trembled and the ground shook. This fear was caused by God.
7525	9	14	16	¶Saul’s watchmen at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin looked on as the crowd of soldiers seemed to melt away first in one direction and then in another.
7526	9	14	17	So Saul said to the army that was with him, “Muster the troops and see who is no longer with us.” When they mustered the troops, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.
7527	9	14	18	So Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring near the ephod,” for he was at that time wearing the ephod in front of the Israelites.
7528	9	14	19	While Saul spoke to the priest, the panic in the Philistines’ camp was becoming greater and greater. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand!”
7529	9	14	20	¶Saul and all the army that was with him assembled and marched into battle, where they found the Philistines in total panic killing one another with their swords.
7530	9	14	21	The Hebrews who had earlier gone over to the Philistine side joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
7531	9	14	22	When all the Israelites who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they too pursued them in battle.
7532	9	14	23	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> delivered Israel that day, and the battle shifted over to Beth Aven.
7533	9	14	24	¶Now the men of Israel were hard pressed that day, for Saul had made the army agree to this oath: “Cursed be the man who eats food before evening! I will get my vengeance on my enemies!” So no one in the army ate anything.
7534	9	14	25	¶Now the whole army entered the forest and there was honey on the ground.
7535	9	14	26	When the army entered the forest, they saw the honey flowing, but no one ate any of it, for the army was afraid of the oath.
7536	9	14	27	But Jonathan had not heard about the oath his father had made the army take. He extended the end of his staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb. When he ate it, his eyes gleamed.
7537	9	14	28	Then someone from the army informed him, “Your father put the army under a strict oath saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today!’ That is why the army is tired.”
7538	9	14	29	Then Jonathan said, “My father has caused trouble for the land. See how my eyes gleamed when I tasted just a little of this honey.
7539	9	14	30	Certainly if the army had eaten some of the enemies’ provisions that they came across today, would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?”
7540	9	14	31	¶On that day the army struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, and they became very tired.
7541	9	14	32	So the army rushed greedily on the plunder, confiscating sheep, cattle, and calves. They slaughtered them right on the ground, and the army ate them blood and all.
7542	9	14	33	¶Now it was reported to Saul, “Look, the army is sinning against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by eating even the blood.” He said, “All of you have broken the covenant! Roll a large stone over here to me.”
7543	9	14	34	Then Saul said, “Scatter out among the army and say to them, ‘Each of you bring to me your ox and sheep and slaughter them in this spot and eat. But don’t sin against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by eating the blood.” So that night each one brought his ox and slaughtered it there.
7544	9	14	35	Then Saul built an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; it was the first time he had built an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7545	9	14	36	¶Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines at night; we will rout them until the break of day. We won’t leave any of them alive!” They replied, “Do whatever seems best to you.” But the priest said, “Let’s approach God here.”
7546	9	14	37	So Saul asked God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him that day.
7547	9	14	38	¶Then Saul said, “All you leaders of the army come here. Find out how this sin occurred today.
7548	9	14	39	For as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the deliverer of Israel, lives, even if it turns out to be my own son Jonathan, he will certainly die!” But no one from the army said anything.
7549	9	14	40	¶Then he said to all Israel, “You will be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side.” The army replied to Saul, “Do whatever you think is best.”
7550	9	14	41	¶Then Saul said, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel! If this sin has been committed by me or by my son Jonathan, then, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, respond with Urim. But if this sin has been committed by your people Israel, respond with Thummim.” Then Jonathan and Saul were indicated by lot, while the army was exonerated.
7551	9	14	42	Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan!” Jonathan was indicated by lot.
7552	9	14	43	¶So Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” Jonathan told him, “I used the end of the staff that was in my hand to taste a little honey. I must die!”
7553	9	14	44	Saul said, “God will punish me severely if Jonathan doesn’t die!”
7554	9	14	45	¶But the army said to Saul, “Should Jonathan, who won this great victory in Israel, die? May it never be! As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, not a single hair of his head will fall to the ground! For it is with the help of God that he has acted today.” So the army rescued Jonathan from death.
7555	9	14	46	¶Then Saul stopped chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines went back home.
7556	9	14	47	After Saul had secured his royal position over Israel, he fought against all their enemies on all sides – the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. In every direction that he turned he was victorious.
7557	9	14	48	He fought bravely, striking down the Amalekites and delivering Israel from the hand of its enemies.
7558	9	14	49	¶The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua. He had two daughters; the older one was named Merab and the younger Michal.
7559	9	14	50	The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the general in command of his army was Abner son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.
7560	9	14	51	Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
7561	9	14	52	¶There was fierce war with the Philistines all the days of Saul. So whenever Saul saw anyone who was a warrior or a brave individual, he would conscript him.
7562	9	15	1	¶Then Samuel said to Saul, “I was the one the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent to anoint you as king over his people Israel. Now listen to what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says.
7563	9	15	2	Here is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has said: ‘I carefully observed how the Amalekites opposed Israel along the way when Israel came up from Egypt.
7564	9	15	3	So go now and strike down the Amalekites. Destroy everything that they have. Don’t spare them. Put them to death – man, woman, child, infant, ox, sheep, camel, and donkey alike.’”
7565	9	15	4	¶So Saul assembled the army and mustered them at Telaim. There were 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah.
7566	9	15	5	Saul proceeded to the city of Amalek, where he set an ambush in the wadi.
7567	9	15	6	Saul said to the Kenites, “Go on and leave! Go down from among the Amalekites! Otherwise I will sweep you away with them! After all, you were kind to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites withdrew from among the Amalekites.
7568	9	15	7	¶Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, which is next to Egypt.
7569	9	15	8	He captured King Agag of the Amalekites alive, but he executed all Agag’s people with the sword.
7570	9	15	9	However, Saul and the army spared Agag, along with the best of the flock, the cattle, the fatlings, and the lambs, as well as everything else that was of value. They were not willing to slaughter them. But they did slaughter everything that was despised and worthless.
7571	9	15	10	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message came to Samuel:
7572	9	15	11	“I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from me and has not done what I told him to do.” Samuel became angry and he cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> all that night.
7573	9	15	12	¶Then Samuel got up early to meet Saul the next morning. But Samuel was informed, “Saul has gone to Carmel where he is setting up a monument for himself.” Then Samuel left and went down to Gilgal.
7574	9	15	13	When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> bless you! I have fulfilled the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s orders.”
7575	9	15	14	¶Samuel replied, “If that is the case, then what is this sound of sheep in my ears and the sound of cattle that I hear?”
7576	9	15	15	Saul said, “They were brought from the Amalekites; the army spared the best of the flocks and cattle to sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God. But everything else we slaughtered.”
7577	9	15	16	¶Then Samuel said to Saul, “Wait a minute! Let me tell you what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me last night.” Saul said to him, “Tell me.”
7578	9	15	17	Samuel said, “Is it not true that when you were insignificant in your own eyes, you became head of the tribes of Israel? The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> chose you as king over Israel.
7579	9	15	18	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent you on a campaign saying, ‘Go and exterminate those sinful Amalekites! Fight against them until you have destroyed them.’
7580	9	15	19	Why haven’t you obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>? Instead you have greedily rushed upon the plunder! You have done what is wrong in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s estimation.”
7581	9	15	20	¶Then Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! I went on the campaign the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent me on. I brought back King Agag of the Amalekites after exterminating the Amalekites.
7582	9	15	21	But the army took from the plunder some of the sheep and cattle – the best of what was to be slaughtered – to sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God in Gilgal.”
7583	9	15	22	¶Then Samuel said, ‡“Does the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> take pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices‡as much as he does in obedience? ‡Certainly, obedience is better than sacrifice;‡paying attention is better than the fat of rams.
7584	9	15	23	‡For rebellion is like the sin of divination,‡and presumption is like the evil of idolatry.‡Because you have rejected the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s orders, ‡he has rejected you from being king.”
7585	9	15	24	¶Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I have disobeyed what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded and your words as well. For I was afraid of the army, and I obeyed their voice.
7586	9	15	25	Now please forgive my sin! Go back with me so I can worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
7587	9	15	26	¶Samuel said to Saul, “I will not go back with you, for you have rejected the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s orders, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has rejected you from being king over Israel!”
7588	9	15	27	¶When Samuel turned to leave, Saul grabbed the edge of his robe and it tore.
7589	9	15	28	Samuel said to him, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to one of your colleagues who is better than you!
7590	9	15	29	The Preeminent One of Israel does not go back on his word or change his mind, for he is not a human being who changes his mind.”
7591	9	15	30	Saul again replied, “I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel. Go back with me so I may worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.”
7592	9	15	31	So Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7593	9	15	32	¶Then Samuel said, “Bring me King Agag of the Amalekites.” So Agag came to him trembling, thinking to himself, “Surely death is bitter!”
7594	9	15	33	Samuel said, “Just as your sword left women childless, so your mother will be the most bereaved among women!” Then Samuel hacked Agag to pieces there in Gilgal before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7595	9	15	34	¶Then Samuel went to Ramah, while Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.
7596	9	15	35	Until the day he died Samuel did not see Saul again. Samuel did, however, mourn for Saul, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.
7597	9	16	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “How long do you intend to mourn for Saul? I have rejected him as king over Israel. Fill your horn with olive oil and go! I am sending you to Jesse in Bethlehem, for I have selected a king for myself from among his sons.”
7598	9	16	2	¶Samuel replied, “How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me!” But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.’</span>
7599	9	16	3	Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you should do. You will anoint for me the one I point out to you.”
7600	9	16	4	¶Samuel did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told him. When he arrived in Bethlehem, the elders of the city were afraid to meet him. They said, “Do you come in peace?”
7601	9	16	5	He replied, “Yes, in peace. I have come to sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” So he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
7602	9	16	6	¶When they arrived, Samuel noticed Eliab and said to himself, “Surely, here before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> stands his chosen king!”
7603	9	16	7	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Don’t be impressed by his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. God does not view things the way men do. People look on the outward appearance, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> looks at the heart.”
7604	9	16	8	¶Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel. But Samuel said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not chosen this one, either.”
7605	9	16	9	Then Jesse presented Shammah. But Samuel said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not chosen this one either.”
7606	9	16	10	Jesse presented seven of his sons to Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not chosen any of these.”
7607	9	16	11	Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Is that all of the young men?” Jesse replied, “There is still the youngest one, but he’s taking care of the flock.” Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him, for we cannot turn our attention to other things until he comes here.”
7608	9	16	12	¶So Jesse had him brought in. Now he was ruddy, with attractive eyes and a handsome appearance. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Go and anoint him. This is the one!”
7609	9	16	13	So Samuel took the horn full of olive oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers. The Spirit of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rushed upon David from that day onward. Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah.
7610	9	16	14	¶Now the Spirit of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had turned away from Saul, and an evil spirit from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> tormented him.
7611	9	16	15	Then Saul’s servants said to him, “Look, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you!
7612	9	16	16	Let our lord instruct his servants who are here before you to look for a man who knows how to play the lyre. Then whenever the evil spirit from God comes upon you, he can play the lyre and you will feel better.”
7613	9	16	17	So Saul said to his servants, “Find me a man who plays well and bring him to me.”
7614	9	16	18	One of his attendants replied, “I have seen a son of Jesse in Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave warrior and is articulate and handsome, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with him.”
7615	9	16	19	¶So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is out with the sheep.”
7616	9	16	20	So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a container of wine, and a young goat and sent them to Saul with his son David.
7617	9	16	21	David came to Saul and stood before him. Saul liked him a great deal, and he became his armor bearer.
7618	9	16	22	Then Saul sent word to Jesse saying, “Let David be my servant, for I really like him.”
7619	9	16	23	¶So whenever the spirit from God would come upon Saul, David would take his lyre and play it. This would bring relief to Saul and make him feel better. Then the evil spirit would leave him alone.
7620	9	17	1	¶The Philistines gathered their troops for battle. They assembled at Socoh in Judah. They camped in Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah.
7621	9	17	2	Saul and the Israelite army assembled and camped in the valley of Elah, where they arranged their battle lines to fight against the Philistines.
7622	9	17	3	The Philistines were standing on one hill, and the Israelites on another hill, with the valley between them.
7623	9	17	4	¶Then a champion came out from the camp of the Philistines. His name was Goliath; he was from Gath. He was close to seven feet tall.
7624	9	17	5	He had a bronze helmet on his head and was wearing scale body armor. The weight of his bronze body armor was five thousand shekels.
7625	9	17	6	He had bronze shin guards on his legs, and a bronze javelin was slung over his shoulders.
7626	9	17	7	The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the iron point of his spear weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer was walking before him.
7627	9	17	8	¶Goliath stood and called to Israel’s troops, “Why do you come out to prepare for battle? Am I not the Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose for yourselves a man so he may come down to me!
7628	9	17	9	If he is able to fight with me and strike me down, we will become your servants. But if I prevail against him and strike him down, you will become our servants and will serve us.”
7629	9	17	10	Then the Philistine said, “I defy Israel’s troops this day! Give me a man so we can fight each other!”
7630	9	17	11	When Saul and all the Israelites heard these words of the Philistine, they were upset and very afraid.
7631	9	17	12	¶Now David was the son of this Ephrathite named Jesse from Bethlehem in Judah. He had eight sons, and in Saul’s days he was old and well advanced in years.
7632	9	17	13	Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to war. The names of the three sons who went to war were Eliab, his firstborn, Abinadab, the second oldest, and Shammah, the third oldest.
7633	9	17	14	Now David was the youngest. While the three oldest sons followed Saul,
7634	9	17	15	David was going back and forth from Saul in order to care for his father’s sheep in Bethlehem.
7635	9	17	16	¶Meanwhile for forty days the Philistine approached every morning and evening and took his position.
7636	9	17	17	Jesse said to his son David, “Take your brothers this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread; go quickly to the camp to your brothers.
7637	9	17	18	Also take these ten portions of cheese to their commanding officer. Find out how your brothers are doing and bring back their pledge that they received the goods.
7638	9	17	19	They are with Saul and the whole Israelite army in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.”
7639	9	17	20	¶So David got up early in the morning and entrusted the flock to someone else who would watch over it. After loading up, he went just as Jesse had instructed him. He arrived at the camp as the army was going out to the battle lines shouting its battle cry.
7640	9	17	21	Israel and the Philistines drew up their battle lines opposite one another.
7641	9	17	22	After David had entrusted his cargo to the care of the supply officer, he ran to the battlefront. When he arrived, he asked his brothers how they were doing.
7642	9	17	23	As he was speaking with them, the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, was coming up from the battle lines of the Philistines. He spoke the way he usually did, and David heard it.
7643	9	17	24	When all the men of Israel saw this man, they retreated from his presence and were very afraid.
7644	9	17	25	¶The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who is coming up? He does so to defy Israel. But the king will make the man who can strike him down very wealthy! He will give him his daughter in marriage, and he will make his father’s house exempt from tax obligations in Israel.”
7645	9	17	26	¶David asked the men who were standing near him, “What will be done for the man who strikes down this Philistine and frees Israel from this humiliation? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he defies the armies of the living God?”
7646	9	17	27	The soldiers told him what had been promised, saying, “This is what will be done for the man who can strike him down.”
7647	9	17	28	¶When David’s oldest brother Eliab heard him speaking to the men, he became angry with David and said, “Why have you come down here? To whom did you entrust those few sheep in the wilderness? I am familiar with your pride and deceit! You have come down here to watch the battle!”
7648	9	17	29	¶David replied, “What have I done now? Can’t I say anything?”
7649	9	17	30	Then he turned from those who were nearby to someone else and asked the same question, but they gave him the same answer as before.
7650	9	17	31	When David’s words were overheard and reported to Saul, he called for him.
7651	9	17	32	¶David said to Saul, “Don’t let anyone be discouraged. Your servant will go and fight this Philistine!”
7652	9	17	33	But Saul replied to David, “You aren’t able to go against this Philistine and fight him! You’re just a boy! He has been a warrior from his youth!”
7653	9	17	34	¶David replied to Saul, “Your servant has been a shepherd for his father’s flock. Whenever a lion or bear would come and carry off a sheep from the flock,
7654	9	17	35	I would go out after it, strike it down, and rescue the sheep from its mouth. If it rose up against me, I would grab it by its jaw, strike it, and kill it.
7655	9	17	36	Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be just like one of them. For he has defied the armies of the living God!”
7656	9	17	37	David went on to say, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who delivered me from the lion and the bear will also deliver me from the hand of this Philistine!” Then Saul said to David, “Go! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be with you.”
7657	9	17	38	¶Then Saul clothed David with his own fighting attire and put a bronze helmet on his head. He also put body armor on him.
7658	9	17	39	David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire and tried to walk around, but he was not used to them. David said to Saul, “I can’t walk in these things, for I’m not used to them.” So David removed them.
7659	9	17	40	He took his staff in his hand, picked out five smooth stones from the stream, placed them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag, took his sling in hand, and approached the Philistine.
7660	9	17	41	¶The Philistine kept coming closer to David, with his shield bearer walking in front of him.
7661	9	17	42	When the Philistine looked carefully at David, he despised him, for he was only a ruddy and handsome boy.
7662	9	17	43	The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you are coming after me with sticks?” Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
7663	9	17	44	The Philistine said to David, “Come here to me, so I can give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the field!”
7664	9	17	45	¶But David replied to the Philistine, “You are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin. But I am coming against you in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel’s armies, whom you have defied!
7665	9	17	46	This very day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will deliver you into my hand! I will strike you down and cut off your head. This day I will give the corpses of the Philistine army to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the land. Then all the land will realize that Israel has a God,
7666	9	17	47	and all this assembly will know that it is not by sword or spear that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> saves! For the battle is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s, and he will deliver you into our hand.”
7667	9	17	48	¶The Philistine drew steadily closer to David to attack him, while David quickly ran toward the battle line to attack the Philistine.
7668	9	17	49	David reached his hand into the bag and took out a stone. He slung it, striking the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank deeply into his forehead, and he fell down with his face to the ground.
7669	9	17	50	¶David prevailed over the Philistine with just the sling and the stone. He struck down the Philistine and killed him. David did not even have a sword in his hand.
7670	9	17	51	David ran and stood over the Philistine. He grabbed Goliath’s sword, drew it from its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they ran away.
7671	9	17	52	¶Then the men of Israel and Judah charged forward, shouting a battle cry. They chased the Philistines to the valley and to the very gates of Ekron. The Philistine corpses lay fallen along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.
7672	9	17	53	When the Israelites returned from their hot pursuit of the Philistines, they looted their camp.
7673	9	17	54	David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put Goliath’s weapons in his tent.
7674	9	17	55	¶Now as Saul watched David going out to fight the Philistine, he asked Abner, the general in command of the army, “Whose son is this young man, Abner?” Abner replied, “As surely as you live, O king, I don’t know.”
7675	9	17	56	The king said, “Find out whose son this boy is!”
7676	9	17	57	¶So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. He still had the head of the Philistine in his hand.
7677	9	17	58	Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” David replied, “I am the son of your servant Jesse in Bethlehem.”
7678	9	18	1	¶When David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan and David became bound together in close friendship. Jonathan loved David as much as he did his own life.
7679	9	18	2	Saul retained David on that day and did not allow him to return to his father’s house.
7680	9	18	3	Jonathan made a covenant with David, for he loved him as much as he did his own life.
7681	9	18	4	Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with the rest of his gear, including his sword, his bow, and even his belt.
7682	9	18	5	¶On every mission on which Saul sent him, David achieved success. So Saul appointed him over the men of war. This pleased not only all the army, but also Saul’s servants.
7683	9	18	6	¶When the men arrived after David returned from striking down the Philistine, the women from all the cities of Israel came out singing and dancing to meet King Saul. They were happy as they played their tambourines and three-stringed instruments.
7684	9	18	7	The women who were playing the music sang,‡“Saul has struck down his thousands,‡but David his tens of thousands!”
7685	9	18	8	¶This made Saul very angry. The statement displeased him and he thought, “They have attributed to David tens of thousands, but to me they have attributed only thousands. What does he lack, except the kingdom?”
7686	9	18	9	So Saul was keeping an eye on David from that day onward.
7687	9	18	10	¶The next day an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul and he prophesied within his house. Now David was playing the lyre as usual. There was a spear in Saul’s hand,
7688	9	18	11	and Saul threw the spear, thinking, “I’ll nail David to the wall!” But David escaped from him on two different occasions.
7689	9	18	12	¶So Saul feared David, because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with him but had departed from Saul.
7690	9	18	13	Saul removed David from his presence and made him a commanding officer. David led the army out to battle and back.
7691	9	18	14	Now David achieved success in all he did, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with him.
7692	9	18	15	When Saul saw how very successful he was, he was afraid of him.
7693	9	18	16	But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he was the one leading them out to battle and back.
7694	9	18	17	¶Then Saul said to David, “Here’s my oldest daughter, Merab. I want to give her to you in marriage. Only be a brave warrior for me and fight the battles of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”For Saul thought, “There’s no need for me to raise my hand against him. Let it be the hand of the Philistines!”
7695	9	18	18	¶David said to Saul, “Who am I? Who are my relatives or the clan of my father in Israel that I should become the king’s son-in-law?”
7696	9	18	19	When the time came for Merab, Saul’s daughter, to be given to David, she instead was given in marriage to Adriel, who was from Meholah.
7697	9	18	20	¶Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David. When they told Saul about this, it pleased him.
7698	9	18	21	Saul said, “I will give her to him so that she may become a snare to him and the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “Today is the second time for you to become my son-in-law.”
7699	9	18	22	¶Then Saul instructed his servants, “Tell David secretly, ‘The king is pleased with you, and all his servants like you. So now become the king’s son-in-law.”
7700	9	18	23	So Saul’s servants spoke these words privately to David. David replied, “Is becoming the king’s son-in-law something insignificant to you? I’m just a poor and lightly-esteemed man!”
7701	9	18	24	¶When Saul’s servants reported what David had said,
7702	9	18	25	Saul replied, “Here is what you should say to David: ‘There is nothing that the king wants as a price for the bride except a hundred Philistine foreskins, so that he can be avenged of his enemies.’” (Now Saul was thinking that he could kill David by the hand of the Philistines.)
7703	9	18	26	¶So his servants told David these things and David agreed to become the king’s son-in-law. Now the specified time had not yet expired
7704	9	18	27	when David, along with his men, went out and struck down two hundred Philistine men. David brought their foreskins and presented all of them to the king so he could become the king’s son-in-law. Saul then gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.
7705	9	18	28	¶When Saul realized that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,
7706	9	18	29	Saul became even more afraid of him. Saul continued to be at odds with David from then on.
7707	9	18	30	Then the leaders of the Philistines would march out, and as often as they did so, David achieved more success than all of Saul’s servants. His name was held in high esteem.
7708	9	19	1	¶Then Saul told his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David. But Saul’s son Jonathan liked David very much.
7709	9	19	2	So Jonathan told David, “My father Saul is trying to kill you. So be careful tomorrow morning. Find a hiding place and stay in seclusion.
7710	9	19	3	I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are. I will speak about you to my father. When I find out what the problem is, I will let you know.”
7711	9	19	4	¶So Jonathan spoke on David’s behalf to his father Saul. He said to him, “The king should not sin against his servant David, for he has not sinned against you. On the contrary, his actions have been very beneficial for you.
7712	9	19	5	He risked his life when he struck down the Philistine and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave all Israel a great victory. When you saw it, you were happy. So why would you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death for no reason?”
7713	9	19	6	¶Saul accepted Jonathan’s advice and took an oath, “As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, he will not be put to death.”
7714	9	19	7	Then Jonathan called David and told him all these things. Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he served him as he had done formerly.
7715	9	19	8	¶Now once again there was war. So David went out to fight the Philistines. He defeated them thoroughly and they ran away from him.
7716	9	19	9	Then an evil spirit from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came upon Saul. He was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing the lyre.
7717	9	19	10	Saul tried to nail David to the wall with the spear, but he escaped from Saul’s presence and the spear drove into the wall. David escaped quickly that night.
7718	9	19	11	¶Saul sent messengers to David’s house to guard it and to kill him in the morning. Then David’s wife Michal told him, “If you do not save yourself tonight, tomorrow you will be dead!”
7719	9	19	12	So Michal lowered David through the window, and he ran away and escaped.
7720	9	19	13	¶Then Michal took a household idol and put it on the bed. She put a quilt made of goat’s hair over its head and then covered the idol with a garment.
7721	9	19	14	When Saul sent messengers to arrest David, she said, “He’s sick.”
7722	9	19	15	¶Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me on his bed so I can kill him.”
7723	9	19	16	When the messengers came, they found only the idol on the bed and the quilt made of goat’s hair at its head.
7724	9	19	17	¶Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me this way by sending my enemy away? Now he has escaped!” Michal replied to Saul, “He said to me, ‘Help me get away or else I will kill you!’”
7725	9	19	18	¶Now David had run away and escaped. He went to Samuel in Ramah and told him everything that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed at Naioth.
7726	9	19	19	It was reported to Saul saying, “David is at Naioth in Ramah.”
7727	9	19	20	So Saul sent messengers to capture David. When they saw a company of prophets prophesying with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul’s messengers, and they also prophesied.
7728	9	19	21	When it was reported to Saul, he sent more messengers, but they prophesied too. So Saul sent messengers a third time, but they also prophesied.
7729	9	19	22	Finally Saul himself went to Ramah. When he arrived at the large cistern that is in Secu, he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” They said, “At Naioth in Ramah.”
7730	9	19	23	¶So Saul went to Naioth in Ramah. The Spirit of God came upon him as well, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
7731	9	19	24	He even stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He lay there naked all that day and night. (For that reason it is asked, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”)
7732	9	20	1	¶David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my offense? How have I sinned before your father? For he is seeking my life!”
7733	9	20	2	¶Jonathan said to him, “By no means are you going to die! My father does nothing large or small without making me aware of it. Why would my father hide this matter from me? It just won’t happen!”
7734	9	20	3	¶Taking an oath, David again said, “Your father is very much aware of the fact that I have found favor with you, and he has thought, ‘Don’t let Jonathan know about this, or he will be upset.’ But as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives and you live, there is about one step between me and death!”
7735	9	20	4	Jonathan replied to David, “Tell me what I can do for you.”
7736	9	20	5	¶David said to Jonathan, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and I am certainly expected to join the king for a meal. You must send me away so I can hide in the field until the third evening from now.
7737	9	20	6	If your father happens to miss me, you should say, ‘David urgently requested me to let him go to his city Bethlehem, for there is an annual sacrifice there for his entire family.’
7738	9	20	7	If he should then say, ‘That’s fine,’ then your servant is safe. But if he becomes very angry, be assured that he has decided to harm me.
7739	9	20	8	You must be loyal to your servant, for you have made a covenant with your servant in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s name. If I am guilty, you yourself kill me! Why bother taking me to your father?”
7740	9	20	9	¶Jonathan said, “Far be it from you to suggest this! If I were at all aware that my father had decided to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you about it?”
7741	9	20	10	David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”
7742	9	20	11	Jonathan said to David, “Come on. Let’s go out to the field.”¶When the two of them had gone out into the field,
7743	9	20	12	Jonathan said to David, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel is my witness. I will feel out my father about this time the day after tomorrow. If he is favorably inclined toward David, will I not then send word to you and let you know?
7744	9	20	13	But if my father intends to do you harm, may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> do all this and more to Jonathan, if I don’t let you know and send word to you so you can go safely on your way. May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> be with you, as he was with my father.
7745	9	20	14	While I am still alive, extend to me the loyalty of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, or else I will die!
7746	9	20	15	Don’t ever cut off your loyalty to my family, not even when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has cut off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth
7747	9	20	16	and called David’s enemies to account.” So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David.
7748	9	20	17	Jonathan once again took an oath with David, because he loved him. In fact Jonathan loved him as much as he did his own life.
7749	9	20	18	Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, for your seat will be empty.
7750	9	20	19	On the third day you should go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself the day this all started. Stay near the stone Ezel.
7751	9	20	20	I will shoot three arrows near it, as though I were shooting at a target.
7752	9	20	21	When I send a boy after them, I will say, “Go and find the arrows.” If I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; get them,’ then come back. For as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, you will be safe and there will be no problem.
7753	9	20	22	But if I say to the boy, “Look, the arrows are on the other side of you,’ get away. For in that case the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent you away.
7754	9	20	23	With regard to the matter that you and I discussed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the witness between us forever!”
7755	9	20	24	¶So David hid in the field. When the new moon came, the king sat down to eat his meal.
7756	9	20	25	The king sat down in his usual place by the wall, with Jonathan opposite him and Abner at his side. But David’s place was vacant.
7757	9	20	26	However, Saul said nothing about it that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to make him ceremonially unclean. Yes, he must be unclean.”
7758	9	20	27	But the next morning, the second day of the new moon, David’s place was still vacant. So Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why has Jesse’s son not come to the meal yesterday or today?”
7759	9	20	28	¶Jonathan replied to Saul, “David urgently requested that he be allowed to go to Bethlehem.
7760	9	20	29	He said, ‘Permit me to go, for we are having a family sacrifice in the city, and my brother urged me to be there. So now, if I have found favor with you, let me go to see my brothers.’ For that reason he has not come to the king’s table.”
7761	9	20	30	¶Saul became angry with Jonathan and said to him, “You stupid traitor! Don’t I realize that to your own disgrace and to the disgrace of your mother’s nakedness you have chosen this son of Jesse?
7762	9	20	31	For as long as this son of Jesse is alive on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established. Now, send some men and bring him to me. For he is as good as dead!”
7763	9	20	32	¶Jonathan responded to his father Saul, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”
7764	9	20	33	Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan in order to strike him down. So Jonathan was convinced that his father had decided to kill David.
7765	9	20	34	Jonathan got up from the table enraged. He did not eat any food on that second day of the new moon, for he was upset that his father had humiliated David.
7766	9	20	35	¶The next morning Jonathan, along with a young servant, went out to the field to meet David.
7767	9	20	36	He said to his servant, “Run, find the arrows that I am about to shoot.” As the servant ran, Jonathan shot the arrow beyond him.
7768	9	20	37	When the servant came to the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow, Jonathan called out to the servant, “Isn’t the arrow further beyond you?”
7769	9	20	38	Jonathan called out to the servant, “Hurry! Go faster! Don’t delay!” Jonathan’s servant retrieved the arrow and came back to his master.
7770	9	20	39	(Now the servant did not understand any of this. Only Jonathan and David knew what was going on.)
7771	9	20	40	Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the servant who was with him. He said to him, “Go, take these things back to the city.”
7772	9	20	41	¶When the servant had left, David got up from beside the mound, knelt with his face to the ground, and bowed three times. Then they kissed each other and they both wept, especially David.
7773	9	20	42	Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for the two of us have sworn together in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> saying, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’”
7774	9	21	1	¶(<a href='bible://1Sa.21.1'>21:1</a>) Then David got up and left, while Jonathan went back to the city. (<a href='bible://1Sa.21.2'>21:2</a>) David went to Ahimelech the priest in Nob. Ahimelech was shaking with fear when he met David, and said to him, “Why are you by yourself with no one accompanying you?”
7775	9	21	2	David replied to Ahimelech the priest, “The king instructed me to do something, but he said to me, ‘Don’t let anyone know the reason I am sending you or the instructions I have given you.’ I have told my soldiers to wait at a certain place.
7776	9	21	3	Now what do you have at your disposal? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.”
7777	9	21	4	¶The priest replied to David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread at my disposal. Only holy bread is available, and then only if your soldiers have abstained from relations with women.”
7778	9	21	5	David said to the priest, “Certainly women have been kept away from us, just as on previous occasions when I have set out. The soldiers’ equipment is holy, even on an ordinary journey. How much more so will they be holy today, along with their equipment!”
7779	9	21	6	¶So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there other than the bread of the Presence. It had been removed from before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in order to replace it with hot bread on the day it had been taken away.
7780	9	21	7	(One of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. His name was Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul’s shepherds.)
7781	9	21	8	David said to Ahimelech, “Is there no sword or spear here at your disposal? I don’t have my own sword or equipment in hand due to the urgency of the king’s instructions.”
7782	9	21	9	¶The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the valley of Elah, is wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish, take it for yourself. Other than that, there’s nothing here.” David said, “There’s nothing like it! Give it to me!”
7783	9	21	10	So on that day David arose and fled from Saul. He went to King Achish of Gath.
7784	9	21	11	The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one that they sing about when they dance, saying,‡‘Saul struck down his thousands,‡But David his tens of thousands’?”
7785	9	21	12	¶David thought about what they said and was very afraid of King Achish of Gath.
7786	9	21	13	He altered his behavior in their presence. Since he was in their power, he pretended to be insane, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting his saliva run down his beard.
7787	9	21	14	¶Achish said to his servants, “Look at this madman! Why did you bring him to me?
7788	9	21	15	Do I have a shortage of fools, that you have brought me this man to display his insanity in front of me? Should this man enter my house?”
7789	9	22	1	¶So David left there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and the rest of his father’s family learned about it, they went down there to him.
7790	9	22	2	All those who were in trouble or owed someone money or were discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. He had about four hundred men with him.
7791	9	22	3	¶Then David went from there to Mizpah in Moab, where he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God is going to do for me.”
7792	9	22	4	So he had them stay with the king of Moab; they stayed with him the whole time that David was in the stronghold.
7793	9	22	5	Then Gad the prophet said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold. Go to the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
7794	9	22	6	¶But Saul found out the whereabouts of David and the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree at an elevated location with his spear in hand and all his servants stationed around him.
7795	9	22	7	Saul said to his servants who were stationed around him, “Listen up, you Benjaminites! Is Jesse’s son giving fields and vineyards to all of you? Or is he making all of you commanders and officers?
7796	9	22	8	For all of you have conspired against me! No one informs me when my own son makes an agreement with this son of Jesse! Not one of you feels sorry for me or informs me that my own son has commissioned my own servant to hide in ambush against me, as is the case today!”
7797	9	22	9	¶But Doeg the Edomite, who had stationed himself with the servants of Saul, replied, “I saw this son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.
7798	9	22	10	He inquired of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for him and gave him provisions. He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”
7799	9	22	11	¶Then the king arranged for a meeting with the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and all the priests of his father’s house who were at Nob. They all came to the king.
7800	9	22	12	Then Saul said, “Listen, son of Ahitub.” He replied, “Here I am, my lord.”
7801	9	22	13	Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and this son of Jesse? You gave him bread and a sword and inquired of God on his behalf, so that he opposes me and waits in ambush, as is the case today!”
7802	9	22	14	¶Ahimelech replied to the king, “Who among all your servants is faithful like David? He is the king’s son-in-law, the leader of your bodyguard, and honored in your house!
7803	9	22	15	Was it just today that I began to inquire of God on his behalf? Far be it from me! The king should not accuse his servant or any of my father’s house. For your servant is not aware of all this – not in whole or in part!”
7804	9	22	16	¶But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house!”
7805	9	22	17	Then the king said to the messengers who were stationed beside him, “Turn and kill the priests of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for they too have sided with David! They knew he was fleeing, but they did not inform me.” But the king’s servants refused to harm the priests of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7806	9	22	18	¶Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests. He killed on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.
7807	9	22	19	As for Nob, the city of the priests, he struck down with the sword men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep – all with the sword.
7808	9	22	20	¶But one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped and fled to David. His name was Abiathar.
7809	9	22	21	Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
7810	9	22	22	Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would certainly tell Saul! I am guilty of all the deaths in your father’s house!
7811	9	22	23	Stay with me. Don’t be afraid! Whoever seeks my life is seeking your life as well. You are secure with me.”
7812	9	23	1	¶They told David, “The Philistines are fighting in Keilah and are looting the threshing floors.”
7813	9	23	2	So David asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Should I go and strike down these Philistines?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to David, “Go, strike down the Philistines and deliver Keilah.”
7814	9	23	3	¶But David’s men said to him, “We are afraid while we are still here in Judah! What will it be like if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”
7815	9	23	4	So David asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> once again. But again the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> replied, “Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand.”
7816	9	23	5	¶So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines. He took away their cattle and thoroughly defeated them. David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.
7817	9	23	6	¶Now when Abiathar son of Ahimelech had fled to David at Keilah, he had brought with him an ephod.
7818	9	23	7	When Saul was told that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has boxed himself into a corner by entering a city with two barred gates.”
7819	9	23	8	So Saul mustered all his army to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men.
7820	9	23	9	¶When David realized that Saul was planning to harm him, he told Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod!”
7821	9	23	10	Then David said, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, your servant has clearly heard that Saul is planning to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me.
7822	9	23	11	Will the leaders of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, please inform your servant!”¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “He will come down.”
7823	9	23	12	David asked, “Will the leaders of Keilah deliver me and my men into Saul’s hand?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “They will deliver you over.”
7824	9	23	13	¶So David and his men, who numbered about six hundred, set out and left Keilah; they moved around from one place to another. When told that David had escaped from Keilah, Saul called a halt to his expedition.
7825	9	23	14	David stayed in the strongholds that were in the desert and in the hill country of the wilderness of Ziph. Saul looked for him all the time, but God did not deliver David into his hand.
7826	9	23	15	David realized that Saul had come out to seek his life; at that time David was in Horesh in the wilderness of Ziph.
7827	9	23	16	¶Then Jonathan son of Saul left and went to David at Horesh. He encouraged him through God.
7828	9	23	17	He said to him, “Don’t be afraid! For the hand of my father Saul cannot find you. You will rule over Israel, and I will be your second in command. Even my father Saul realizes this.”
7829	9	23	18	When the two of them had made a covenant before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, David stayed on at Horesh, but Jonathan went to his house.
7830	9	23	19	¶Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Isn’t David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon?
7831	9	23	20	Now at your own discretion, O king, come down. Delivering him into the king’s hand will be our responsibility.”
7832	9	23	21	¶Saul replied, “May you be blessed by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for you have had compassion on me.
7833	9	23	22	Go and make further arrangements. Determine precisely where he is and who has seen him there, for I am told that he is extremely cunning.
7834	9	23	23	Locate precisely all the places where he hides and return to me with dependable information. Then I will go with you. If he is in the land, I will find him among all the thousands of Judah.”
7835	9	23	24	¶So they left and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the rift valley to the south of Jeshimon.
7836	9	23	25	Saul and his men went to look for him. But David was informed and went down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard about it, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.
7837	9	23	26	Saul went on one side of the mountain, while David and his men went on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, but Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men so they could capture them.
7838	9	23	27	But a messenger came to Saul saying, “Come quickly, for the Philistines have raided the land!”
7839	9	23	28	¶So Saul stopped pursuing David and went to confront the Philistines. Therefore that place is called Sela Hammahlekoth.
7840	9	23	29	(24:1) Then David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of En Gedi.
7841	9	24	1	¶(<a href='bible://1Sa.24.2'>24:2</a>) When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, they told him, “Look, David is in the desert of En Gedi.”
7842	9	24	2	So Saul took three thousand select men from all Israel and went to find David and his men in the region of the rocks of the mountain goats.
7843	9	24	3	He came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there was a cave. Saul went into it to relieve himself. ¶Now David and his men were sitting in the recesses of the cave.
7844	9	24	4	David’s men said to him, “This is the day about which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hand, and you can do to him whatever seems appropriate to you.’” So David got up and quietly cut off an edge of Saul’s robe.
7845	9	24	5	Afterward David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off an edge of Saul’s robe.
7846	9	24	6	He said to his men, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> keep me far away from doing such a thing to my lord, who is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s chosen one, by extending my hand against him. After all, he is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s chosen one.”
7847	9	24	7	David restrained his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and started down the road.
7848	9	24	8	¶Afterward David got up and went out of the cave. He called out after Saul, “My lord, O king!” When Saul looked behind him, David kneeled down and bowed with his face to the ground.
7849	9	24	9	David said to Saul, “Why do you pay attention when men say, ‘David is seeking to do you harm’?
7850	9	24	10	Today your own eyes see how the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> delivered you – this very day – into my hands in the cave. Some told me to kill you, but I had pity on you and said, ‘I will not extend my hand against my lord, for he is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s chosen one.’
7851	9	24	11	Look, my father, and see the edge of your robe in my hand! When I cut off the edge of your robe, I didn’t kill you. So realize and understand that I am not planning evil or rebellion. Even though I have not sinned against you, you are waiting in ambush to take my life.
7852	9	24	12	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> judge between the two of us, and may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> vindicate me over you, but my hand will not be against you.
7853	9	24	13	It’s like the old proverb says: ‘From evil people evil proceeds.’ But my hand will not be against you.
7854	9	24	14	Who has the king of Israel come out after? Who is it that you are pursuing? A dead dog? A single flea?
7855	9	24	15	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> be our judge and arbiter. May he see and arbitrate my case and deliver me from your hands!”
7856	9	24	16	¶When David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” Then Saul wept loudly.
7857	9	24	17	He said to David, “You are more innocent than I, for you have treated me well, even though I have tried to harm you!
7858	9	24	18	You have explained today how you have treated me well. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> delivered me into your hand, but you did not kill me.
7859	9	24	19	Now if a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way in good shape? May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> repay you with good this day for what you have done to me.
7860	9	24	20	Now look, I realize that you will in fact be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.
7861	9	24	21	So now swear to me in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s name that you will not kill my descendants after me or destroy my name from the house of my father.”
7862	9	24	22	¶David promised Saul this on oath. Then Saul went to his house, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.
7863	9	25	1	¶Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David left and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
7864	9	25	2	¶There was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. This man was very wealthy; he owned three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. At that time he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
7865	9	25	3	The man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was both wise and beautiful, but the man was harsh and his deeds were evil. He was a Calebite.
7866	9	25	4	¶When David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep,
7867	9	25	5	he sent ten servants, saying to them, “Go up to Carmel to see Nabal and give him greetings in my name.
7868	9	25	6	Then you will say to my brother, “Peace to you and your house! Peace to all that is yours!
7869	9	25	7	Now I hear that they are shearing sheep for you. When your shepherds were with us, we neither insulted them nor harmed them the whole time they were in Carmel.
7870	9	25	8	Ask your own servants; they can tell you! May my servants find favor in your sight, for we have come at the time of a holiday. Please provide us – your servants and your son David – with whatever you can spare.”
7871	9	25	9	¶So David’s servants went and spoke all these words to Nabal in David’s name. Then they paused.
7872	9	25	10	But Nabal responded to David’s servants, “Who is David, and who is this son of Jesse? This is a time when many servants are breaking away from their masters!
7873	9	25	11	Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers and give them to these men? I don’t even know where they came from!”
7874	9	25	12	¶So David’s servants went on their way. When they had returned, they came and told David all these things.
7875	9	25	13	Then David instructed his men, “Each of you strap on your sword!” So each one strapped on his sword, and David also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men followed David up, while two hundred stayed behind with the equipment.
7876	9	25	14	¶But one of the servants told Nabal’s wife Abigail, “David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our lord, but he screamed at them.
7877	9	25	15	These men were very good to us. They did not insult us, nor did we sustain any loss during the entire time we were together in the field.
7878	9	25	16	Both night and day they were a protective wall for us the entire time we were with them, while we were tending our flocks.
7879	9	25	17	Now be aware of this, and see what you can do. For disaster has been planned for our lord and his entire household. He is such a wicked person that no one tells him anything!”
7880	9	25	18	¶So Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread, two containers of wine, five prepared sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred bunches of raisins, and two hundred lumps of pressed figs. She loaded them on donkeys
7881	9	25	19	and said to her servants, “Go on ahead of me. I will come after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
7882	9	25	20	¶Riding on her donkey, she went down under cover of the mountain. David and his men were coming down to meet her, and she encountered them.
7883	9	25	21	Now David had been thinking, “In vain I guarded everything that belonged to this man in the wilderness. I didn’t take anything from him. But he has repaid my good with evil.
7884	9	25	22	God will severely punish David, if I leave alive until morning even one male from all those who belong to him!”
7885	9	25	23	¶When Abigail saw David, she got down quickly from the donkey, threw herself facedown before David, and bowed to the ground.
7886	9	25	24	Falling at his feet, she said, “My lord, I accept all the guilt! But please let your female servant speak to you! Please listen to the words of your servant!
7887	9	25	25	My lord should not pay attention to this wicked man Nabal. He simply lives up to his name! His name means ‘fool,’ and he is indeed foolish! But I, your servant, did not see the servants my lord sent.
7888	9	25	26	¶“Now, my lord, as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives and as surely as you live, it is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who has kept you from shedding blood and taking matters into your own hands. Now may your enemies and those who seek to harm my lord be like Nabal.
7889	9	25	27	Now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the servants who follow my lord.
7890	9	25	28	Please forgive the sin of your servant, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will certainly establish a lasting dynasty for my lord, because my lord fights the battles of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. May no evil be found in you all your days!
7891	9	25	29	When someone sets out to chase you and to take your life, the life of my lord will be wrapped securely in the bag of the living by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. But he will sling away the lives of your enemies from the sling’s pocket!
7892	9	25	30	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will do for my lord everything that he promised you, and he will make you a leader over Israel.
7893	9	25	31	Your conscience will not be overwhelmed with guilt for having poured out innocent blood and for having taken matters into your own hands. When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has granted my lord success, please remember your servant.”
7894	9	25	32	¶Then David said to Abigail, “Praised be the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> the God of Israel, who has sent you this day to meet me!
7895	9	25	33	Praised be your good judgment! May you yourself be rewarded for having prevented me this day from shedding blood and taking matters into my own hands!
7896	9	25	34	Otherwise, as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, lives – he who has prevented me from harming you – if you had not come so quickly to meet me, by morning’s light not even one male belonging to Nabal would have remained alive!”
7897	9	25	35	Then David took from her hand what she had brought to him. He said to her, “Go back to your home in peace. Be assured that I have listened to you and responded favorably.”
7898	9	25	36	¶When Abigail went back to Nabal, he was holding a banquet in his house like that of the king. Nabal was having a good time and was very intoxicated. She told him absolutely nothing until morning’s light.
7899	9	25	37	In the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him about these matters. He had a stroke and was paralyzed.
7900	9	25	38	After about ten days the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> struck Nabal down and he died.
7901	9	25	39	¶When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, “Praised be the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who has vindicated me and avenged the insult that I suffered from Nabal! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has kept his servant from doing evil, and he has repaid Nabal for his evil deeds.” Then David sent word to Abigail and asked her to become his wife.
7902	9	25	40	¶So the servants of David went to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, “David has sent us to you to bring you back to be his wife.”
7903	9	25	41	She arose, bowed her face toward the ground, and said, “Your female servant, like a lowly servant, will wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”
7904	9	25	42	Then Abigail quickly went and mounted her donkey, with five of her female servants accompanying her. She followed David’s messengers and became his wife.
7905	9	25	43	¶David had also married Ahinoam from Jezreel; the two of them became his wives.
7906	9	25	44	(Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.)
7907	9	26	1	¶The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Isn’t David hiding on the hill of Hakilah near Jeshimon?”
7908	9	26	2	So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, accompanied by three thousand select men of Israel, to look for David in the wilderness of Ziph.
7909	9	26	3	Saul camped by the road on the hill of Hakilah near Jeshimon, but David was staying in the wilderness. When he realized that Saul had come to the wilderness to find him,
7910	9	26	4	David sent scouts and verified that Saul had indeed arrived.
7911	9	26	5	¶So David set out and went to the place where Saul was camped. David saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general in command of his army, were sleeping. Now Saul was lying in the entrenchment, and the army was camped all around him.
7912	9	26	6	David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” Abishai replied, “I will go down with you.”
7913	9	26	7	¶So David and Abishai approached the army at night and found Saul lying asleep in the entrenchment with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. Abner and the army were lying all around him.
7914	9	26	8	Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me drive the spear right through him into the ground with one swift jab! A second jab won’t be necessary!”
7915	9	26	9	¶But David said to Abishai, “Don’t kill him! Who can extend his hand against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s chosen one and remain guiltless?”
7916	9	26	10	David went on to say, “As the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> himself will strike him down. Either his day will come and he will die, or he will go down into battle and be swept away.
7917	9	26	11	But may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> prevent me from extending my hand against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s chosen one! Now take the spear by Saul’s head and the jug of water, and let’s get out of here!”
7918	9	26	12	So David took the spear and the jug of water by Saul’s head, and they got out of there. No one saw them or was aware of their presence or woke up. All of them were asleep, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had caused a deep sleep to fall on them.
7919	9	26	13	¶Then David crossed to the other side and stood on the top of the hill some distance away; there was a considerable distance between them.
7920	9	26	14	David called to the army and to Abner son of Ner, “Won’t you answer, Abner?” Abner replied, “Who are you, that you have called to the king?”
7921	9	26	15	David said to Abner, “Aren’t you a man? After all, who is like you in Israel? Why then haven’t you protected your lord the king? One of the soldiers came to kill your lord the king.
7922	9	26	16	This failure on your part isn’t good! As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, you people who have not protected your lord, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s chosen one, are as good as dead! Now look where the king’s spear and the jug of water that was by his head are!”
7923	9	26	17	¶When Saul recognized David’s voice, he said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” David replied, “Yes, it’s my voice, my lord the king.”
7924	9	26	18	He went on to say, “Why is my lord chasing his servant? What have I done? What wrong have I done?
7925	9	26	19	So let my lord the king now listen to the words of his servant. If the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has incited you against me, may he take delight in an offering. But if men have instigated this, may they be cursed before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! For they have driven me away this day from being united with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s inheritance, saying, ‘Go on, serve other gods!’
7926	9	26	20	Now don’t let my blood fall to the ground away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence, for the king of Israel has gone out to look for a flea the way one looks for a partridge in the hill country.”
7927	9	26	21	¶Saul replied, “I have sinned. Come back, my son David. I won’t harm you anymore, for you treated my life with value this day. I have behaved foolishly and have made a very terrible mistake!”
7928	9	26	22	David replied, “Here is the king’s spear! Let one of your servants cross over and get it.
7929	9	26	23	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rewards each man for his integrity and loyalty. Even though today the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> delivered you into my hand, I was not willing to extend my hand against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s chosen one.
7930	9	26	24	In the same way that I valued your life this day, may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> value my life and deliver me from all danger.”
7931	9	26	25	Saul replied to David, “May you be rewarded, my son David! You will without question be successful!” So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
7932	9	27	1	¶David thought to himself, “One of these days I’m going to be swept away by the hand of Saul! There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of searching for me through all the territory of Israel and I will escape from his hand.”
7933	9	27	2	¶So David left and crossed over to King Achish son of Maoch of Gath accompanied by his six hundred men.
7934	9	27	3	David settled with Achish in Gath, along with his men and their families. David had with him his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal’s widow.
7935	9	27	4	When Saul learned that David had fled to Gath, he did not mount a new search for him.
7936	9	27	5	¶David said to Achish, “If I have found favor with you, let me be given a place in one of the country towns so that I can live there. Why should your servant settle in the royal city with you?”
7937	9	27	6	So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (For that reason Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this very day.)
7938	9	27	7	The length of time that David lived in the Philistine countryside was a year and four months.
7939	9	27	8	¶Then David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (They had been living in that land for a long time, from the approach to Shur as far as the land of Egypt.)
7940	9	27	9	When David would attack a district, he would leave neither man nor woman alive. He would take sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing and would then go back to Achish.
7941	9	27	10	When Achish would ask, “Where did you raid today?” David would say, “The Negev of Judah” or “The Negev of Jeharmeel” or “The Negev of the Kenites.”
7942	9	27	11	Neither man nor woman would David leave alive so as to bring them back to Gath. He was thinking, “This way they can’t tell on us, saying, ‘This is what David did.’” Such was his practice the entire time that he lived in the country of the Philistines.
7943	9	27	12	So Achish trusted David, thinking to himself, “He is really hated among his own people in Israel! From now on he will be my servant.”
7944	9	28	1	¶In those days the Philistines gathered their troops for war in order to fight Israel. Achish said to David, “You should fully understand that you and your men must go with me into the battle.”
7945	9	28	2	David replied to Achish, “That being the case, you will come to know what your servant can do!” Achish said to David, “Then I will make you my bodyguard from now on.”
7946	9	28	3	¶Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented over him and had buried him in Ramah, his hometown. In the meantime Saul had removed the mediums and magicians from the land.
7947	9	28	4	The Philistines assembled; they came and camped at Shunem. Saul mustered all Israel and camped at Gilboa.
7948	9	28	5	When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was absolutely terrified.
7949	9	28	6	So Saul inquired of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did not answer him – not by dreams nor by Urim nor by the prophets.
7950	9	28	7	So Saul instructed his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so that I may go to her and inquire of her.” His servants replied to him, “There is a woman who is a medium in En Dor.”
7951	9	28	8	¶So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing and left, accompanied by two of his men. They came to the woman at night and said, “Use your ritual pit to conjure up for me the one I tell you.”
7952	9	28	9	¶But the woman said to him, “Look, you are aware of what Saul has done; he has removed the mediums and magicians from the land! Why are you trapping me so you can put me to death?”
7953	9	28	10	But Saul swore an oath to her by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, you will not incur guilt in this matter!”
7954	9	28	11	The woman replied, “Who is it that I should bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up for me Samuel.”
7955	9	28	12	¶When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out loudly. The woman said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”
7956	9	28	13	The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid! What have you seen?” The woman replied to Saul, “I have seen a divine spirit coming up from the ground!”
7957	9	28	14	He said to her, “What about his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up! He is wrapped in a robe!”¶Then Saul realized it was Samuel, and he bowed his face toward the ground and kneeled down.
7958	9	28	15	Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul replied, “I am terribly troubled! The Philistines are fighting against me and God has turned away from me. He does not answer me anymore – not by the prophets nor by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what I should do.”
7959	9	28	16	¶Samuel said, “Why are you asking me, now that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has turned away from you and has become your enemy?
7960	9	28	17	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has done exactly as I prophesied! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor David!
7961	9	28	18	Since you did not obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and did not carry out his fierce anger against the Amalekites, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has done this thing to you today.
7962	9	28	19	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will hand you and Israel over to the Philistines! Tomorrow both you and your sons will be with me. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will also hand the army of Israel over to the Philistines!”
7963	9	28	20	¶Saul quickly fell full length on the ground and was very afraid because of Samuel’s words. He was completely drained of energy, not having eaten anything all that day and night.
7964	9	28	21	When the woman came to Saul and saw how terrified he was, she said to him, “Your servant has done what you asked. I took my life into my own hands and did what you told me.
7965	9	28	22	Now it’s your turn to listen to your servant! Let me set before you a bit of bread so that you can eat. When you regain your strength, you can go on your way.”
7966	9	28	23	¶But he refused, saying, “I won’t eat!” Both his servants and the woman urged him to eat, so he gave in. He got up from the ground and sat down on the bed.
7967	9	28	24	Now the woman had a well-fed calf at her home that she quickly slaughtered. Taking some flour, she kneaded it and baked bread without leaven.
7968	9	28	25	She brought it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they arose and left that same night.
7969	9	29	1	¶The Philistines assembled all their troops at Aphek, while Israel camped at the spring that is in Jezreel.
7970	9	29	2	When the leaders of the Philistines were passing in review at the head of their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were passing in review in the rear with Achish.
7971	9	29	3	¶The leaders of the Philistines asked, “What about these Hebrews?” Achish said to the leaders of the Philistines, “Isn’t this David, the servant of King Saul of Israel, who has been with me for quite some time? I have found no fault with him from the day of his defection until the present time!”
7972	9	29	4	¶But the leaders of the Philistines became angry with him and said to him, “Send the man back! Let him return to the place that you assigned him! Don’t let him go down with us into the battle, for he might become our adversary in the battle. What better way to please his lord than with the heads of these men?
7973	9	29	5	Isn’t this David, of whom they sang as they danced, ‡‘Saul has struck down his thousands,‡but David his tens of thousands’?”
7974	9	29	6	¶So Achish summoned David and said to him, “As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, you are an honest man, and I am glad to have you serving with me in the army. I have found no fault with you from the day that you first came to me until the present time. But in the opinion of the leaders, you are not reliable.
7975	9	29	7	So turn and leave in peace. You must not do anything that the leaders of the Philistines consider improper!”
7976	9	29	8	¶But David said to Achish, “What have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day that I first came into your presence until the present time, that I shouldn’t go and fight the enemies of my lord the king?”
7977	9	29	9	Achish replied to David, “I am convinced that you are as reliable as the angel of God! However, the leaders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us in the battle.’
7978	9	29	10	So get up early in the morning along with the servants of your lord who have come with you. When you get up early in the morning, as soon as it is light enough to see, leave.”
7979	9	29	11	¶So David and his men got up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines, but the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
7980	9	30	1	¶On the third day David and his men came to Ziklag. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They attacked Ziklag and burned it.
7981	9	30	2	They took captive the women and all who were in it, from the youngest to the oldest, but they did not kill anyone. They simply carried them off and went on their way.
7982	9	30	3	¶When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned. Their wives, sons, and daughters had been taken captive.
7983	9	30	4	Then David and the men who were with him wept loudly until they could weep no more.
7984	9	30	5	David’s two wives had been taken captive – Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal’s widow.
7985	9	30	6	David was very upset, for the men were thinking of stoning him; each man grieved bitterly over his sons and daughters. But David drew strength from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God.
7986	9	30	7	¶Then David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
7987	9	30	8	David inquired of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, saying, “Should I pursue this raiding band? Will I overtake them?” He said to him, “Pursue, for you will certainly overtake them and carry out a rescue!”
7988	9	30	9	¶So David went, accompanied by his six hundred men. When he came to the Wadi Besor, those who were in the rear stayed there.
7989	9	30	10	David and four hundred men continued the pursuit, but two hundred men who were too exhausted to cross the Wadi Besor stayed there.
7990	9	30	11	¶Then they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. They gave him bread to eat and water to drink.
7991	9	30	12	They gave him a slice of pressed figs and two bunches of raisins to eat. This greatly refreshed him, for he had not eaten food or drunk water for three days and three nights.
7992	9	30	13	David said to him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?” The young man said, “I am an Egyptian, the servant of an Amalekite man. My master abandoned me when I was ill for three days.
7993	9	30	14	We conducted a raid on the Negev of the Kerethites, on the area of Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb. We burned Ziklag.”
7994	9	30	15	David said to him, “Can you take us down to this raiding party?” He said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to this raiding party.”
7995	9	30	16	¶So he took David down, and they found them spread out over the land. They were eating and drinking and enjoying themselves because of all the loot they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
7996	9	30	17	But David struck them down from twilight until the following evening. None of them escaped, with the exception of four hundred young men who got away on camels.
7997	9	30	18	David retrieved everything the Amalekites had taken; he also rescued his two wives.
7998	9	30	19	There was nothing missing, whether small or great. He retrieved sons and daughters, the plunder, and everything else they had taken. David brought everything back.
7999	9	30	20	David took all the flocks and herds and drove them in front of the rest of the animals. People were saying, “This is David’s plunder!”
8000	9	30	21	¶Then David approached the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to go with him, those whom they had left at the Wadi Besor. They went out to meet David and the people who were with him. When David approached the people, he asked how they were doing.
8001	9	30	22	But all the evil and worthless men among those who had gone with David said, “Since they didn’t go with us, we won’t give them any of the loot we retrieved! They may take only their wives and children. Let them lead them away and be gone!”
8002	9	30	23	¶But David said, “No! You shouldn’t do this, my brothers. Look at what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given us! He has protected us and has delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us.
8003	9	30	24	Who will listen to you in this matter? The portion of the one who went down into the battle will be the same as the portion of the one who remained with the equipment! Let their portions be the same!”
8004	9	30	25	¶From that time onward it was a binding ordinance for Israel, right up to the present time.
8005	9	30	26	¶When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah who were his friends, saying, “Here’s a gift for you from the looting of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s enemies!”
8006	9	30	27	The gift was for those in the following locations: for those in Bethel, Ramoth Negev, and Jattir;
8007	9	30	28	for those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa,
8008	9	30	29	and Racal; for those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and Kenites;
8009	9	30	30	for those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach,
8010	9	30	31	and Hebron; and for those in whatever other places David and his men had traveled.
8011	9	31	1	¶Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel. The men of Israel fled from the Philistines and many of them fell dead on Mount Gilboa.
8012	9	31	2	The Philistines stayed right on the heels of Saul and his sons. They struck down Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua.
8013	9	31	3	Saul himself was in the thick of the battle; the archers spotted him and wounded him severely.
8014	9	31	4	¶Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and stab me with it! Otherwise these uncircumcised people will come, stab me, and torture me.” But his armor bearer refused to do it, because he was very afraid. So Saul took his sword and fell on it.
8015	9	31	5	When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his own sword and died with him.
8016	9	31	6	So Saul, his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men died together that day.
8017	9	31	7	¶When the men of Israel who were in the valley and across the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled. The Philistines came and occupied them.
8018	9	31	8	¶The next day, when the Philistines came to strip loot from the corpses, they discovered Saul and his three sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa.
8019	9	31	9	They cut off Saul’s head and stripped him of his armor. They sent messengers to announce the news in the temple of their idols and among their people throughout the surrounding land of the Philistines.
8020	9	31	10	They placed Saul’s armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and hung his corpse on the city wall of Beth Shan.
8021	9	31	11	¶When the residents of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
8022	9	31	12	all their warriors set out and traveled throughout the night. They took Saul’s corpse and the corpses of his sons from the city wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them.
8023	9	31	13	They took the bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh; then they fasted for seven days.
8024	10	1	1	¶After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, he stayed at Ziklag for two days.
8025	10	1	2	On the third day a man arrived from the camp of Saul with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. When he approached David, the man threw himself to the ground.
8026	10	1	3	¶David asked him, “Where are you coming from?” He replied, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”
8027	10	1	4	David inquired, “How were things going? Tell me!” He replied, “The people fled from the battle and many of them fell dead. Even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead!”
8028	10	1	5	David said to the young man who was telling him this, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
8029	10	1	6	The young man who was telling him this said, “I just happened to be on Mount Gilboa and came across Saul leaning on his spear for support. The chariots and leaders of the horsemen were in hot pursuit of him.
8030	10	1	7	When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me. I answered, ‘Here I am!’
8031	10	1	8	He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I told him, ‘I’m an Amalekite.’
8032	10	1	9	He said to me, ‘Stand over me and finish me off! I’m very dizzy, even though I’m still alive.’
8033	10	1	10	So I stood over him and put him to death, since I knew that he couldn’t live in such a condition. Then I took the crown which was on his head and the bracelet which was on his arm. I have brought them here to my lord.”
8034	10	1	11	¶David then grabbed his own clothes and tore them, as did all the men who were with him.
8035	10	1	12	They lamented and wept and fasted until evening because Saul, his son Jonathan, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s people, and the house of Israel had fallen by the sword.
8036	10	1	13	¶David said to the young man who told this to him, “Where are you from?” He replied, “I am an Amalekite, the son of a resident foreigner.”
8037	10	1	14	David replied to him, “How is it that you were not afraid to reach out your hand to destroy the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anointed?”
8038	10	1	15	Then David called one of the soldiers and said, “Come here and strike him down!” So he struck him down, and he died.
8039	10	1	16	David said to him, “Your blood be on your own head! Your own mouth has testified against you, saying ‘I have put the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anointed to death.’”
8040	10	1	17	¶Then David chanted this lament over Saul and his son Jonathan.
8041	10	1	18	(He gave instructions that the people of Judah should be taught “The Bow.” Indeed, it is written down in the Scroll of the Upright One.)
8042	10	1	19	‡The beauty of Israel lies slain on your high places!‡How the mighty have fallen!
8043	10	1	20	‡Don’t report it in Gath,‡don’t spread the news in the streets of Ashkelon, ‡or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,‡the daughters of the uncircumcised will celebrate!
8044	10	1	21	‡O mountains of Gilboa, ‡may there be no dew or rain on you, nor fields of grain offerings! ‡For it was there that the shield of warriors was defiled; ‡the shield of Saul lies neglected without oil.
8045	10	1	22	‡From the blood of the slain, from the fat of warriors,‡the bow of Jonathan was not turned away.‡The sword of Saul never returned empty.
8046	10	1	23	‡Saul and Jonathan were greatly loved during their lives,‡and not even in their deaths were they separated.‡They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
8047	10	1	24	‡O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,‡who clothed you in scarlet as well as jewelry,‡who put gold jewelry on your clothes.
8048	10	1	25	‡How the warriors have fallen‡in the midst of battle!‡Jonathan lies slain on your high places!
8049	10	1	26	‡I grieve over you, my brother Jonathan!‡You were very dear to me.‡Your love was more special to me than the love of women.
8050	10	1	27	‡How the warriors have fallen!‡The weapons of war are destroyed!
8051	10	2	1	¶Afterward David inquired of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told him, “Go up.” David asked, “Where should I go?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> replied, “To Hebron.”
8052	10	2	2	So David went up, along with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail, formerly the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
8053	10	2	3	David also brought along the men who were with him, each with his family. They settled in the cities of Hebron.
8054	10	2	4	The men of Judah came and there they anointed David as king over the people of Judah.¶David was told, “The people of Jabesh Gilead are the ones who buried Saul.”
8055	10	2	5	So David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh Gilead and told them, “May you be blessed by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> because you have shown this kindness to your lord Saul by burying him.
8056	10	2	6	Now may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> show you true kindness! I also will reward you, because you have done this deed.
8057	10	2	7	Now be courageous and prove to be valiant warriors, for your lord Saul is dead. The people of Judah have anointed me as king over them.”
8058	10	2	8	¶Now Abner son of Ner, the general in command of Saul’s army, had taken Saul’s son Ish-bosheth and had brought him to Mahanaim.
8059	10	2	9	He appointed him king over Gilead, the Geshurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all Israel.
8060	10	2	10	Ish-bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he began to rule over Israel. He ruled two years. However, the people of Judah followed David.
8061	10	2	11	David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah for seven and a half years.
8062	10	2	12	¶Then Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
8063	10	2	13	Joab son of Zeruiah and the servants of David also went out and confronted them at the pool of Gibeon. One group stationed themselves on one side of the pool, and the other group on the other side of the pool.
8064	10	2	14	Abner said to Joab, “Let the soldiers get up and fight before us.” Joab said, “So be it!”
8065	10	2	15	¶So they got up and crossed over by number: twelve belonging to Benjamin and to Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.
8066	10	2	16	As they grappled with one another, each one stabbed his opponent with his sword and they fell dead together. So that place is called the Field of Flints; it is in Gibeon.
8067	10	2	17	¶Now the battle was very severe that day; Abner and the men of Israel were overcome by David’s soldiers.
8068	10	2	18	The three sons of Zeruiah were there – Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. (Now Asahel was as quick on his feet as one of the gazelles in the field.)
8069	10	2	19	Asahel chased Abner, without turning to the right or to the left as he followed Abner.
8070	10	2	20	¶Then Abner turned and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?” He replied, “Yes it is!”
8071	10	2	21	Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right or to your left. Capture one of the soldiers and take his equipment for yourself!” But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from following him.
8072	10	2	22	So Abner spoke again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me! I do not want to strike you to the ground. How then could I show my face in the presence of Joab your brother?”
8073	10	2	23	But Asahel refused to turn aside. So Abner struck him in the abdomen with the back end of his spear. The spear came out his back; Asahel collapsed on the spot and died there right before Abner. Everyone who now comes to the place where Asahel fell dead pauses in respect.
8074	10	2	24	¶So Joab and Abishai chased Abner. At sunset they came to the hill of Ammah near Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
8075	10	2	25	The Benjaminites formed their ranks behind Abner and were like a single army, standing at the top of a certain hill.
8076	10	2	26	¶Then Abner called out to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize that this will turn bitter in the end? When will you tell the people to turn aside from pursuing their brothers?”
8077	10	2	27	Joab replied, “As surely as God lives, if you had not said this, it would have been morning before the people would have abandoned pursuit of their brothers!”
8078	10	2	28	Then Joab blew the ram’s horn and all the people stopped in their tracks. They stopped chasing Israel and ceased fighting.
8079	10	2	29	Abner and his men went through the rift valley all that night. They crossed the Jordan River and went through the whole region of Bitron and came to Mahanaim.
8080	10	2	30	¶Now Joab returned from chasing Abner and assembled all the people. Nineteen of David’s soldiers were missing, in addition to Asahel.
8081	10	2	31	But David’s soldiers had slaughtered the Benjaminites and Abner’s men – in all, 360 men had died!
8082	10	2	32	They took Asahel’s body and buried him in his father’s tomb at Bethlehem. Joab and his men then traveled all that night and reached Hebron by dawn.
8083	10	3	1	However, the war was prolonged between the house of Saul and the house of David. David was becoming steadily stronger, while the house of Saul was becoming increasingly weaker.
8084	10	3	2	¶Now sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, born to Ahinoam the Jezreelite.
8085	10	3	3	His second son was Kileab, born to Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. His third son was Absalom, the son of Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur.
8086	10	3	4	His fourth son was Adonijah, the son of Haggith. His fifth son was Shephatiah, the son of Abital.
8087	10	3	5	His sixth son was Ithream, born to David’s wife Eglah. These sons were all born to David in Hebron.
8088	10	3	6	¶As the war continued between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was becoming more influential in the house of Saul.
8089	10	3	7	Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth said to Abner, “Why did you sleep with my father’s concubine?”
8090	10	3	8	¶These words of Ish-bosheth really angered Abner and he said, “Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah? This very day I am demonstrating loyalty to the house of Saul your father and to his relatives and his friends! I have not betrayed you into the hand of David. Yet you have accused me of sinning with this woman today!
8091	10	3	9	God will severely judge Abner if I do not do for David exactly what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has promised him,
8092	10	3	10	namely, to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah all the way from Dan to Beer Sheba!”
8093	10	3	11	Ish-bosheth was unable to answer Abner with even a single word because he was afraid of him.
8094	10	3	12	¶Then Abner sent messengers to David saying, “To whom does the land belong? Make an agreement with me, and I will do whatever I can to cause all Israel to turn to you.”
8095	10	3	13	So David said, “Good! I will make an agreement with you. I ask only one thing from you. You will not see my face unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal when you come to visit me.”
8096	10	3	14	¶David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth son of Saul with this demand: “Give me my wife Michal whom I acquired for a hundred Philistine foreskins.”
8097	10	3	15	So Ish-bosheth took her from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.
8098	10	3	16	Her husband went along behind her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Finally Abner said to him, “Go back!” So he returned home.
8099	10	3	17	¶Abner advised the elders of Israel, “Previously you were wanting David to be your king.
8100	10	3	18	Act now! For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said to David, ‘By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the Philistines and from all their enemies.’”
8101	10	3	19	¶Then Abner spoke privately with the Benjaminites. Abner also went to Hebron to inform David privately of all that Israel and the entire house of Benjamin had agreed to.
8102	10	3	20	When Abner, accompanied by twenty men, came to David in Hebron, David prepared a banquet for Abner and the men who were with him.
8103	10	3	21	Abner said to David, “Let me leave so that I may go and gather all Israel to my lord the king so that they may make an agreement with you. Then you will rule over all that you desire.” So David sent Abner away, and he left in peace.
8104	10	3	22	¶Now David’s soldiers and Joab were coming back from a raid, bringing a great deal of plunder with them. Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, for David had sent him away and he had left in peace.
8105	10	3	23	When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, Joab was told: “Abner the son of Ner came to the king; he sent him away, and he left in peace!”
8106	10	3	24	¶So Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner has come to you! Why would you send him away? Now he’s gone on his way!
8107	10	3	25	You know Abner the son of Ner! Surely he came here to spy on you and to determine when you leave and when you return and to discover everything that you are doing!”
8108	10	3	26	¶Then Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well of Sirah. (But David was not aware of it.)
8109	10	3	27	When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate as if to speak privately with him. Joab then stabbed him in the abdomen and killed him, avenging the shed blood of his brother Asahel.
8110	10	3	28	¶When David later heard about this, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of the shed blood of Abner son of Ner!
8111	10	3	29	May his blood whirl over the head of Joab and the entire house of his father! May the males of Joab’s house never cease to have someone with a running sore or a skin disease or one who works at the spindle or one who falls by the sword or one who lacks food!”
8112	10	3	30	¶So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel in Gibeon during the battle.
8113	10	3	31	¶David instructed Joab and all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes! Put on sackcloth! Lament before Abner!” Now King David followed behind the funeral pallet.
8114	10	3	32	So they buried Abner in Hebron. The king cried loudly over Abner’s grave and all the people wept too.
8115	10	3	33	The king chanted the following lament for Abner:‡“Should Abner have died like a fool?
8116	10	3	34	‡Your hands were not bound,‡and your feet were not put into irons.‡You fell the way one falls before criminals.”¶All the people wept over him again.
8117	10	3	35	Then all the people came and encouraged David to eat food while it was still day. But David took an oath saying, “God will punish me severely if I taste bread or anything whatsoever before the sun sets!”
8118	10	3	36	¶All the people noticed this and it pleased them. In fact, everything the king did pleased all the people.
8119	10	3	37	All the people and all Israel realized on that day that the killing of Abner son of Ner was not done at the king’s instigation.
8120	10	3	38	¶Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not realize that a great leader has fallen this day in Israel?
8121	10	3	39	Today I am weak, even though I am anointed as king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too much for me to bear! May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> punish appropriately the one who has done this evil thing!”
8122	10	4	1	¶When Ish-bosheth the son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he was very disheartened, and all Israel was afraid.
8123	10	4	2	Now Saul’s son had two men who were in charge of raiding units; one was named Baanah and the other Recab. They were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, who was a Benjaminite. (Beeroth is regarded as belonging to Benjamin,
8124	10	4	3	for the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have remained there as resident foreigners until the present time.)
8125	10	4	4	¶Now Saul’s son Jonathan had a son who was crippled in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan arrived from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but in her haste to get away, he fell and was injured. Mephibosheth was his name.
8126	10	4	5	¶Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite – Recab and Baanah – went at the hottest part of the day to the home of Ish-bosheth, as he was enjoying his midday rest.
8127	10	4	6	They entered the house under the pretense of getting wheat and mortally wounded him in the stomach. Then Recab and his brother Baanah escaped.
8128	10	4	7	¶They had entered the house while Ish-bosheth was resting on his bed in his bedroom. They mortally wounded him and then cut off his head. Taking his head, they traveled on the way of the rift valley all that night.
8129	10	4	8	They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron, saying to the king, “Look! The head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has granted vengeance to my lord the king this day against Saul and his descendants!”
8130	10	4	9	¶David replied to Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, who has delivered my life from all adversity,
8131	10	4	10	when someone told me that Saul was dead – even though he thought he was bringing good news – I seized him and killed him in Ziklag. That was the good news I gave to him!
8132	10	4	11	Surely when wicked men have killed an innocent man as he slept in his own house, should I not now require his blood from your hands and remove you from the earth?”
8133	10	4	12	¶So David issued orders to the soldiers and they put them to death. Then they cut off their hands and feet and hung them near the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron.
8134	10	5	1	¶All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron saying, “Look, we are your very flesh and blood!
8135	10	5	2	In the past, when Saul was our king, you were the real leader in Israel. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel; you will rule over Israel.’”
8136	10	5	3	¶When all the leaders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, King David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They designated David as king over Israel.
8137	10	5	4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned for forty years.
8138	10	5	5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
8139	10	5	6	¶Then the king and his men advanced to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who lived in the land. The Jebusites said to David, “You cannot invade this place! Even the blind and the lame will turn you back, saying, ‘David cannot invade this place!’”
8140	10	5	7	¶But David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David).
8141	10	5	8	David said on that day, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites must approach the ‘lame’ and the ‘blind’ who are David’s enemies by going through the water tunnel.” For this reason it is said, “The blind and the lame cannot enter the palace.”
8142	10	5	9	¶So David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David. David built all around it, from the terrace inwards.
8143	10	5	10	David’s power grew steadily, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies was with him.
8144	10	5	11	¶King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons. They built a palace for David.
8145	10	5	12	David realized that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had established him as king over Israel and that he had elevated his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
8146	10	5	13	David married more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he arrived from Hebron. Even more sons and daughters were born to David.
8147	10	5	14	These are the names of children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
8148	10	5	15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
8149	10	5	16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
8150	10	5	17	¶When the Philistines heard that David had been designated king over Israel, they all went up to search for David. When David heard about it, he went down to the fortress.
8151	10	5	18	Now the Philistines had arrived and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.
8152	10	5	19	So David asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Should I march up against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to David, “March up, for I will indeed hand the Philistines over to you.”
8153	10	5	20	¶So David marched against Baal Perazim and defeated them there. Then he said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has burst out against my enemies like water bursts out.” So he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
8154	10	5	21	The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men picked them up.
8155	10	5	22	¶The Philistines again came up and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.
8156	10	5	23	So David asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> what he should do. This time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Don’t march straight up. Instead, circle around behind them and come against them opposite the trees.
8157	10	5	24	When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the trees, act decisively. For at that moment the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is going before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.”
8158	10	5	25	David did just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines from Gibeon all the way to Gezer.
8159	10	6	1	¶David again assembled all the best men in Israel, thirty thousand in number.
8160	10	6	2	David and all the men who were with him traveled to Baalah in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, who sits enthroned between the cherubim that are on it.
8161	10	6	3	They loaded the ark of God on a new cart and carried it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart.
8162	10	6	4	They brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab on the hill. Ahio was walking in front of the ark,
8163	10	6	5	while David and all Israel were energetically celebrating before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, singing and playing various stringed instruments, tambourines, rattles, and cymbals.
8164	10	6	6	¶When they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and grabbed hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled.
8165	10	6	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was so furious with Uzzah, he killed him on the spot for his negligence. He died right there beside the ark of God.
8166	10	6	8	¶David was angry because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> attacked Uzzah; so he called that place Perez Uzzah, which remains its name to this very day.
8167	10	6	9	David was afraid of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that day and said, “How will the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> ever come to me?”
8168	10	6	10	So David was no longer willing to bring the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to be with him in the City of David. David left it in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
8169	10	6	11	The ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> blessed Obed-Edom and all his family.
8170	10	6	12	King David was told, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has blessed the family of Obed-Edom and everything he owns because of the ark of God.” So David went and joyfully brought the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David.
8171	10	6	13	Those who carried the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> took six steps and then David sacrificed an ox and a fatling calf.
8172	10	6	14	Now David, wearing a linen ephod, was dancing with all his strength before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
8173	10	6	15	David and all Israel were bringing up the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, shouting and blowing trumpets.
8174	10	6	16	¶As the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> entered the City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked out the window. When she saw King David leaping and dancing before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, she despised him.
8175	10	6	17	They brought the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and put it in its place in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
8176	10	6	18	When David finished offering the burnt sacrifices and peace offerings, he pronounced a blessing over the people in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
8177	10	6	19	He then handed out to each member of the entire assembly of Israel, both men and women, a portion of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake. Then all the people went home.
8178	10	6	20	When David went home to pronounce a blessing on his own house, Michal, Saul’s daughter, came out to meet him. She said, “How the king of Israel has distinguished himself this day! He has exposed himself today before his servants’ slave girls the way a vulgar fool might do!”
8179	10	6	21	¶David replied to Michal, “It was before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! I was celebrating before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> who chose me over your father and his entire family and appointed me as leader over the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s people Israel.
8180	10	6	22	I am willing to shame and humiliate myself even more than this! But with the slave girls whom you mentioned let me be distinguished!”
8181	10	6	23	Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, had no children to the day of her death.
8182	10	7	1	¶The king settled into his palace, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave him relief from all his enemies on all sides.
8183	10	7	2	The king said to Nathan the prophet, “Look! I am living in a palace made from cedar, while the ark of God sits in the middle of a tent.”
8184	10	7	3	Nathan replied to the king, “You should go and do whatever you have in mind, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with you.”
8185	10	7	4	That night the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Nathan,
8186	10	7	5	“Go, tell my servant David: ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: Do you really intend to build a house for me to live in?
8187	10	7	6	I have not lived in a house from the time I brought the Israelites up from Egypt to the present day. Instead, I was traveling with them and living in a tent.
8188	10	7	7	Wherever I moved among all the Israelites, I did not say to any of their leaders whom I appointed to care for my people Israel, “Why have you not built me a house made from cedar?”’
8189	10	7	8	¶“So now, say this to my servant David: ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has said: I took you from the pasture and from your work as a shepherd to make you leader of my people Israel.
8190	10	7	9	I was with you wherever you went, and I defeated all your enemies before you. Now I will make you as famous as the great men of the earth.
8191	10	7	10	I will establish a place for my people Israel and settle them there; they will live there and not be disturbed any more. Violent men will not oppress them again, as they did in the beginning<sup></sup>
8192	10	7	11	and during the time when I appointed judges to lead my people Israel. Instead, I will give you relief from all your enemies. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> declares to you that he himself will build a dynastic house for you.
8193	10	7	12	When the time comes for you to die, I will raise up your descendant, one of your own sons, to succeed you, and I will establish his kingdom.
8194	10	7	13	He will build a house for my name, and I will make his dynasty permanent.
8195	10	7	14	I will become his father and he will become my son. When he sins, I will correct him with the rod of men and with wounds inflicted by human beings.
8196	10	7	15	But my loyal love will not be removed from him as I removed it from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
8197	10	7	16	Your house and your kingdom will stand before me permanently; your dynasty will be permanent.’”
8198	10	7	17	Nathan told David all these words that were revealed to him.
8199	10	7	18	¶King David went in, sat before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and said, “Who am I, O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and what is my family, that you should have brought me to this point?
8200	10	7	19	And you didn’t stop there, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God! You have also spoken about the future of your servant’s family. Is this your usual way of dealing with men, O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?
8201	10	7	20	What more can David say to you? You have given your servant special recognition, O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!
8202	10	7	21	For the sake of your promise and according to your purpose you have done this great thing in order to reveal it to your servant.
8203	10	7	22	Therefore you are great, O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for there is none like you! There is no God besides you! What we have heard is true!
8204	10	7	23	Who is like your people, Israel, a unique nation on the earth? Their God went to claim a nation for himself and to make a name for himself! You did great and awesome acts for your land, before your people whom you delivered for yourself from the Egyptian empire and its gods.
8205	10	7	24	You made Israel your very own people for all time. You, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, became their God.
8206	10	7	25	So now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God, make this promise you have made about your servant and his family a permanent reality. Do as you promised,
8207	10	7	26	so you may gain lasting fame, as people say, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies is God over Israel!’ The dynasty of your servant David will be established before you,
8208	10	7	27	for you, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, have told your servant, ‘I will build you a dynastic house.’ That is why your servant has had the courage to pray this prayer to you.
8209	10	7	28	Now, O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you are the true God! May your words prove to be true! You have made this good promise to your servant!
8210	10	7	29	Now be willing to bless your servant’s dynasty so that it may stand permanently before you, for you, O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have spoken. By your blessing may your servant’s dynasty be blessed on into the future!”
8211	10	8	1	¶Later David defeated the Philistines and subdued them. David took Metheg Ammah from the Philistines.
8212	10	8	2	He defeated the Moabites. He made them lie on the ground and then used a rope to measure them off. He put two-thirds of them to death and spared the other third. The Moabites became David’s subjects and brought tribute.
8213	10	8	3	David defeated King Hadadezer son of Rehob of Zobah when he came to reestablish his authority over the Euphrates River.
8214	10	8	4	David seized from him 1,700 charioteers and 20,000 infantrymen. David cut the hamstrings of all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
8215	10	8	5	The Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, but David killed 22,000 of the Arameans.
8216	10	8	6	David placed garrisons in the territory of the Arameans of Damascus; the Arameans became David’s subjects and brought tribute. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> protected David wherever he campaigned.
8217	10	8	7	David took the golden shields that belonged to Hadadezer’s servants and brought them to Jerusalem.
8218	10	8	8	From Tebah and Berothai, Hadadezer’s cities, King David took a great deal of bronze.
8219	10	8	9	¶When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,
8220	10	8	10	he sent his son Joram to King David to extend his best wishes and to pronounce a blessing on him for his victory over Hadadezer, for Toi had been at war with Hadadezer. He brought with him various items made of silver, gold, and bronze.
8221	10	8	11	King David dedicated these things to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, along with the dedicated silver and gold that he had taken from all the nations that he had subdued,
8222	10	8	12	including Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek. This also included some of the plunder taken from King Hadadezer son of Rehob of Zobah.
8223	10	8	13	¶David became famous when he returned from defeating the Edomites in the Valley of Salt; he defeated 18,000 in all.
8224	10	8	14	He placed garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s subjects. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> protected David wherever he campaigned.
8225	10	8	15	David reigned over all Israel; he guaranteed justice for all his people.
8226	10	8	16	¶Joab son of Zeruiah was general in command of the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was secretary;
8227	10	8	17	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was scribe;
8228	10	8	18	Benaiah son of Jehoiada supervised the Kerithites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were priests.
8229	10	9	1	¶Then David asked, “Is anyone still left from the family of Saul, so that I may extend kindness to him for the sake of Jonathan?”
8230	10	9	2	¶Now there was a servant from Saul’s house named Ziba, so he was summoned to David. The king asked him, “Are you Ziba?” He replied, “At your service.”
8231	10	9	3	The king asked, “Is there not someone left from Saul’s family, that I may extend God’s kindness to him?” Ziba said to the king, “One of Jonathan’s sons is left; both of his feet are crippled.”
8232	10	9	4	The king asked him, “Where is he?” Ziba told the king, “He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.”
8233	10	9	5	¶So King David had him brought from the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.
8234	10	9	6	When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed low with his face toward the ground. David said, “Mephibosheth?” He replied, “Yes, at your service.”
8235	10	9	7	¶David said to him, “Don’t be afraid, because I will certainly extend kindness to you for the sake of Jonathan your father. I will give back to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will be a regular guest at my table.”
8236	10	9	8	Then Mephibosheth bowed and said, “Of what importance am I, your servant, that you show regard for a dead dog like me?”
8237	10	9	9	¶Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul’s attendant, and said to him, “Everything that belonged to Saul and to his entire house I hereby give to your master’s grandson.
8238	10	9	10	You will cultivate the land for him – you and your sons and your servants. You will bring its produce and it will be food for your master’s grandson to eat. But Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, will be a regular guest at my table.” (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.)
8239	10	9	11	¶Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do everything that my lord the king has instructed his servant to do.” So Mephibosheth was a regular guest at David’s table, just as though he were one of the king’s sons.
8240	10	9	12	¶Now Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. All the members of Ziba’s household were Mephibosheth’s servants.
8241	10	9	13	Mephibosheth was living in Jerusalem, for he was a regular guest at the king’s table. But both his feet were crippled.
8242	10	10	1	¶Later the king of the Ammonites died and his son Hanun succeeded him.
8243	10	10	2	David said, “I will express my loyalty to Hanun son of Nahash just as his father was loyal to me.” So David sent his servants with a message expressing sympathy over his father’s death. When David’s servants entered the land of the Ammonites,
8244	10	10	3	the Ammonite officials said to their lord Hanun, “Do you really think David is trying to honor your father by sending these messengers to express his sympathy? No, David has sent his servants to you to get information about the city and spy on it so they can overthrow it!”
8245	10	10	4	¶So Hanun seized David’s servants and shaved off half of each one’s beard. He cut the lower part of their robes off so that their buttocks were exposed, and then sent them away.
8246	10	10	5	Messengers told David what had happened, so he summoned them, for the men were thoroughly humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown again; then you may come back.”
8247	10	10	6	¶When the Ammonites realized that David was disgusted with them, they sent and hired 20,000 foot soldiers from Aram Beth Rehob and Aram Zobah, in addition to 1000 men from the king of Maacah and 12,000 men from Ish-tob.
8248	10	10	7	¶When David heard the news, he sent Joab and the entire army to meet them.
8249	10	10	8	The Ammonites marched out and were deployed for battle at the entrance of the city gate, while the men from Aram Zobah, Rehob, Ish-tob, and Maacah were by themselves in the field.
8250	10	10	9	¶When Joab saw that the battle would be fought on two fronts, he chose some of Israel’s best men and deployed them against the Arameans.
8251	10	10	10	He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the army and they were deployed against the Ammonites.
8252	10	10	11	Joab said, “If the Arameans start to overpower me, you come to my rescue. If the Ammonites start to overpower you, I will come to your rescue.
8253	10	10	12	Be strong! Let’s fight bravely for the sake of our people and the cities of our God! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will do what he decides is best!”
8254	10	10	13	¶So Joab and his men marched out to do battle with the Arameans, and they fled before him.
8255	10	10	14	When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they fled before his brother Abishai and went into the city. Joab withdrew from fighting the Ammonites and returned to Jerusalem.
8256	10	10	15	¶When the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they consolidated their forces.
8257	10	10	16	Then Hadadezer sent for Arameans from beyond the Euphrates River, and they came to Helam. Shobach, the general in command of Hadadezer’s army, led them.
8258	10	10	17	¶When David was informed, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Helam. The Arameans deployed their forces against David and fought with him.
8259	10	10	18	The Arameans fled before Israel. David killed 700 Aramean charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers. He also struck down Shobach, the general in command of the army, who died there.
8260	10	10	19	When all the kings who were subject to Hadadezer saw they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became subjects of Israel. The Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.
8261	10	11	1	¶In the spring of the year, at the time when kings normally conduct wars, David sent out Joab with his officers and the entire Israelite army. They defeated the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed behind in Jerusalem.
8262	10	11	2	One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. Now this woman was very attractive.
8263	10	11	3	So David sent someone to inquire about the woman. The messenger said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”
8264	10	11	4	¶David sent some messengers to get her. She came to him and he went to bed with her. (Now at that time she was in the process of purifying herself from her menstrual uncleanness.) Then she returned to her home.
8265	10	11	5	The woman conceived and then sent word to David saying, “I’m pregnant.”
8266	10	11	6	¶So David sent a message to Joab that said, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent Uriah to David.
8267	10	11	7	When Uriah came to him, David asked about how Joab and the army were doing and how the campaign was going.
8268	10	11	8	Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your home and relax.” When Uriah left the palace, the king sent a gift to him.
8269	10	11	9	But Uriah stayed at the door of the palace with all the servants of his lord. He did not go down to his house.
8270	10	11	10	¶So they informed David, “Uriah has not gone down to his house.” So David said to Uriah, “Haven’t you just arrived from a journey? Why haven’t you gone down to your house?”
8271	10	11	11	Uriah replied to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah reside in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and my lord’s soldiers are camping in the open field. Should I go to my house to eat and drink and go to bed with my wife? As surely as you are alive, I will not do this thing!”
8272	10	11	12	So David said to Uriah, “Stay here another day. Tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem both that day and the following one.
8273	10	11	13	Then David summoned him. He ate and drank with him, and got him drunk. But in the evening he went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his lord; he did not go down to his own house.
8274	10	11	14	¶In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
8275	10	11	15	In the letter he wrote: “Station Uriah at the front in the thick of the battle and then withdraw from him so he will be cut down and killed.”
8276	10	11	16	¶So as Joab kept watch on the city, he stationed Uriah at the place where he knew the best enemy soldiers were.
8277	10	11	17	When the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, some of David’s soldiers fell in battle. Uriah the Hittite also died.
8278	10	11	18	¶Then Joab sent a full battle report to David.
8279	10	11	19	He instructed the messenger as follows: “When you finish giving the battle report to the king,
8280	10	11	20	if the king becomes angry and asks you, ‘Why did you go so close to the city to fight? Didn’t you realize they would shoot from the wall?
8281	10	11	21	Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerub-Besheth? Didn’t a woman throw an upper millstone down on him from the wall so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go so close to the wall?’ just say to him, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’”
8282	10	11	22	¶So the messenger departed. When he arrived, he informed David of all the news that Joab had sent with him.
8283	10	11	23	The messenger said to David, “The men overpowered us and attacked us in the field. But we forced them to retreat all the way to the door of the city gate.
8284	10	11	24	Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall and some of the king’s soldiers died. Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.”
8285	10	11	25	David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing upset you. There is no way to anticipate whom the sword will cut down. Press the battle against the city and conquer it.’ Encourage him with these words.”
8286	10	11	26	¶When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned for him.
8287	10	11	27	When the time of mourning passed, David had her brought to his palace. She became his wife and she bore him a son. But what David had done upset the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
8288	10	12	1	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent Nathan to David. When he came to David, Nathan said, “There were two men in a certain city, one rich and the other poor.
8289	10	12	2	The rich man had a great many flocks and herds.
8290	10	12	3	But the poor man had nothing except for a little lamb he had acquired. He raised it, and it grew up alongside him and his children. It used to eat his food, drink from his cup, and sleep in his arms. It was just like a daughter to him.
8291	10	12	4	¶“When a traveler arrived at the rich man’s home, he did not want to use one of his own sheep or cattle to feed the traveler who had come to visit him. Instead, he took the poor man’s lamb and cooked it for the man who had come to visit him.”
8292	10	12	5	¶Then David became very angry at this man. He said to Nathan, “As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, the man who did this deserves to die!
8293	10	12	6	Because he committed this cold-hearted crime, he must pay for the lamb four times over!”
8294	10	12	7	¶Nathan said to David, “You are that man! This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said: ‘I chose you to be king over Israel and I rescued you from the hand of Saul.
8295	10	12	8	I gave you your master’s house, and put your master’s wives into your arms. I also gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all that somehow seems insignificant, I would have given you so much more as well!
8296	10	12	9	Why have you shown contempt for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s decrees by doing evil in my sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and you have taken his wife to be your own wife! You have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
8297	10	12	10	So now the sword will never depart from your house. For you have despised me by taking the wife of Uriah the Hittite as your own!’
8298	10	12	11	This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: ‘I am about to bring disaster on you from inside your own household! Right before your eyes I will take your wives and hand them over to your companion. He will go to bed with your wives in broad daylight!
8299	10	12	12	Although you have acted in secret, I will do this thing before all Israel, and in broad daylight.’”
8300	10	12	13	¶Then David exclaimed to Nathan, “I have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!” Nathan replied to David, “Yes, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has forgiven your sin. You are not going to die.
8301	10	12	14	Nonetheless, because you have treated the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with such contempt in this matter, the son who has been born to you will certainly die.”
8302	10	12	15	¶Then Nathan went to his home. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> struck the child that Uriah’s wife had borne to David, and the child became very ill.
8303	10	12	16	Then David prayed to God for the child and fasted. He would even go and spend the night lying on the ground.
8304	10	12	17	The elders of his house stood over him and tried to lift him from the ground, but he was unwilling, and refused to eat food with them.
8305	10	12	18	¶On the seventh day the child died. But the servants of David were afraid to inform him that the child had died, for they said, “While the child was still alive he would not listen to us when we spoke to him. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He will do himself harm!”
8306	10	12	19	¶When David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he realized that the child was dead. So David asked his servants, “Is the child dead?” They replied, “Yes, he’s dead.”
8307	10	12	20	So David got up from the ground, bathed, put on oil, and changed his clothes. He went to the house of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and worshiped. Then, when he entered his palace, he requested that food be brought to him, and he ate.
8308	10	12	21	¶His servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? While the child was still alive, you fasted and wept. Once the child was dead you got up and ate food!”
8309	10	12	22	He replied, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept because I thought, ‘Perhaps the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will show pity and the child will live.
8310	10	12	23	But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Am I able to bring him back at this point? I will go to him, but he cannot return to me!’”
8311	10	12	24	¶So David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He came to her and went to bed with her. Later she gave birth to a son, and David named him Solomon. Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> loved the child
8312	10	12	25	and sent word through Nathan the prophet that he should be named Jedidiah for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sake.
8313	10	12	26	¶So Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal city.
8314	10	12	27	Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, “I have fought against Rabbah and have captured the water supply of the city.
8315	10	12	28	So now assemble the rest of the army and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will capture the city and it will be named for me.”
8316	10	12	29	¶So David assembled all the army and went to Rabbah and fought against it and captured it.
8317	10	12	30	He took the crown of their king from his head – it was gold, weighed about seventy-five pounds, and held a precious stone – and it was placed on David’s head. He also took from the city a great deal of plunder.
8318	10	12	31	He removed the people who were in it and made them labor with saws, iron picks, and iron axes, putting them to work at the brick kiln. This was his policy with all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.
8319	10	13	1	¶Now David’s son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. In the course of time David’s son Amnon fell madly in love with her.
8320	10	13	2	But Amnon became frustrated because he was so lovesick over his sister Tamar. For she was a virgin, and to Amnon it seemed out of the question to do anything to her.
8321	10	13	3	¶Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very crafty man.
8322	10	13	4	He asked Amnon, “Why are you, the king’s son, so depressed every morning? Can’t you tell me?” So Amnon said to him, “I’m in love with Tamar the sister of my brother Absalom.”
8323	10	13	5	Jonadab replied to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes in to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come in so she can fix some food for me. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I can watch. Then I will eat from her hand.’”
8324	10	13	6	¶So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came in to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come in so she can make a couple of cakes in my sight. Then I will eat from her hand.”
8325	10	13	7	¶So David sent Tamar to the house saying, “Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare some food for him.”
8326	10	13	8	So Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, who was lying down. She took the dough, kneaded it, made some cakes while he watched, and baked them.
8327	10	13	9	But when she took the pan and set it before him, he refused to eat. Instead Amnon said, “Get everyone out of here!” So everyone left.
8328	10	13	10	¶Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the cakes into the bedroom; then I will eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes that she had prepared and brought them to her brother Amnon in the bedroom.
8329	10	13	11	As she brought them to him to eat, he grabbed her and said to her, “Come on! Get in bed with me, my sister!”
8330	10	13	12	¶But she said to him, “No, my brother! Don’t humiliate me! This just isn’t done in Israel! Don’t do this foolish thing!
8331	10	13	13	How could I ever be rid of my humiliation? And you would be considered one of the fools in Israel! Just speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.”
8332	10	13	14	But he refused to listen to her. He overpowered her and humiliated her by raping her.
8333	10	13	15	Then Amnon greatly despised her. His disdain toward her surpassed the love he had previously felt toward her. Amnon said to her, “Get up and leave!”
8334	10	13	16	¶But she said to him, “No I won’t, for sending me away now would be worse than what you did to me earlier!” But he refused to listen to her.
8335	10	13	17	He called his personal attendant and said to him, “Take this woman out of my sight and lock the door behind her!”
8336	10	13	18	(Now she was wearing a long robe, for this is what the king’s virgin daughters used to wear.) So Amnon’s attendant removed her and bolted the door behind her.
8337	10	13	19	Then Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe she was wearing. She put her hands on her head and went on her way, wailing as she went.
8338	10	13	20	¶Her brother Absalom said to her, “Was Amnon your brother with you? Now be quiet, my sister. He is your brother. Don’t take it so seriously!” Tamar, devastated, lived in the house of her brother Absalom.
8339	10	13	21	¶Now King David heard about all these things and was very angry.
8340	10	13	22	But Absalom said nothing to Amnon, either bad or good, yet Absalom hated Amnon because he had humiliated his sister Tamar.
8341	10	13	23	¶Two years later Absalom’s sheepshearers were in Baal Hazor, near Ephraim. Absalom invited all the king’s sons.
8342	10	13	24	Then Absalom went to the king and said, “My shearers have begun their work. Let the king and his servants go with me.”
8343	10	13	25	¶But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son. We shouldn’t all go. We shouldn’t burden you in that way.” Though Absalom pressed him, the king was not willing to go. Instead, David blessed him.
8344	10	13	26	¶Then Absalom said, “If you will not go, then let my brother Amnon go with us.” The king replied to him, “Why should he go with you?”
8345	10	13	27	But when Absalom pressed him, he sent Amnon and all the king’s sons along with him.
8346	10	13	28	¶Absalom instructed his servants, “Look! When Amnon is drunk and I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon down,’ kill him then and there. Don’t fear! Is it not I who have given you these instructions? Be strong and courageous!”
8347	10	13	29	So Absalom’s servants did to Amnon exactly what Absalom had instructed. Then all the king’s sons got up; each one rode away on his mule and fled.
8348	10	13	30	¶While they were still on their way, the following report reached David: “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons; not one of them is left!”
8349	10	13	31	Then the king stood up and tore his garments and lay down on the ground. All his servants were standing there with torn garments as well.
8350	10	13	32	¶Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, said, “My lord should not say, ‘They have killed all the young men who are the king’s sons.’ For only Amnon is dead. This is what Absalom has talked about from the day that Amnon humiliated his sister Tamar.
8351	10	13	33	Now don’t let my lord the king be concerned about the report that has come saying, ‘All the king’s sons are dead.’ It is only Amnon who is dead.”
8352	10	13	34	¶In the meantime Absalom fled. When the servant who was the watchman looked up, he saw many people coming from the west on a road beside the hill.
8353	10	13	35	Jonadab said to the king, “Look! The king’s sons have come! It’s just as I said!”
8354	10	13	36	¶Just as he finished speaking, the king’s sons arrived, wailing and weeping. The king and all his servants wept loudly as well.
8355	10	13	37	But Absalom fled and went to King Talmai son of Ammihud of Geshur. And David grieved over his son every day.
8356	10	13	38	¶After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he remained there for three years.
8357	10	13	39	The king longed to go to Absalom, for he had since been consoled over the death of Amnon.
8358	10	14	1	¶Now Joab son of Zeruiah realized that the king longed to see Absalom.
8359	10	14	2	So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman. He told her, “Pretend to be in mourning and put on garments for mourning. Don’t anoint yourself with oil. Instead, act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for some time.
8360	10	14	3	Go to the king and speak to him in the following fashion.” Then Joab told her what to say.
8361	10	14	4	¶So the Tekoan woman went to the king. She bowed down with her face to the ground in deference to him and said, “Please help me, O king!”
8362	10	14	5	The king replied to her, “What do you want?” She answered, “I am a widow; my husband is dead.
8363	10	14	6	Your servant has two sons. When the two of them got into a fight in the field, there was no one present who could intervene. One of them struck the other and killed him.
8364	10	14	7	Now the entire family has risen up against your servant, saying, ‘Turn over the one who struck down his brother, so that we can execute him and avenge the death of his brother whom he killed. In so doing we will also destroy the heir.’ They want to extinguish my remaining coal, leaving no one on the face of the earth to carry on the name of my husband.”
8365	10	14	8	¶Then the king told the woman, “Go to your home. I will give instructions concerning your situation.”
8366	10	14	9	The Tekoan woman said to the king, “My lord the king, let any blame fall on me and on the house of my father. But let the king and his throne be innocent!”
8367	10	14	10	¶The king said, “Bring to me whoever speaks to you, and he won’t bother you again!”
8368	10	14	11	She replied, “In that case, let the king invoke the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God so that the avenger of blood may not add to the killing! Then they will not destroy my son!” He replied, “As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, not a single hair of your son’s head will fall to the ground.”
8369	10	14	12	¶Then the woman said, “Please permit your servant to speak to my lord the king about another matter.” He replied, “Tell me.”
8370	10	14	13	The woman said, “Why have you devised something like this against God’s people? When the king speaks in this fashion, he makes himself guilty, for the king has not brought back the one he has banished.
8371	10	14	14	Certainly we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground that cannot be gathered up again. But God does not take away life; instead he devises ways for the banished to be restored.
8372	10	14	15	I have now come to speak with my lord the king about this matter, because the people have made me fearful. But your servant said, ‘I will speak to the king! Perhaps the king will do what his female servant asks.
8373	10	14	16	Yes! The king may listen and deliver his female servant from the hand of the man who seeks to remove both me and my son from the inheritance God has given us!’
8374	10	14	17	So your servant said, ‘May the word of my lord the king be my security, for my lord the king is like the angel of God when it comes to deciding between right and wrong! May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God be with you!’”
8375	10	14	18	¶Then the king replied to the woman, “Don’t hide any information from me when I question you.” The woman said, “Let my lord the king speak!”
8376	10	14	19	The king said, “Did Joab put you up to all of this?” The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, there is no deviation to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king has said. For your servant Joab gave me instructions. He has put all these words in your servant’s mouth.
8377	10	14	20	Your servant Joab did this so as to change this situation. But my lord has wisdom like that of the angel of God, and knows everything that is happening in the land.”
8378	10	14	21	¶Then the king said to Joab, “All right! I will do this thing! Go and bring back the young man Absalom!”
8379	10	14	22	Then Joab bowed down with his face toward the ground and thanked the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, because the king has granted the request of your servant!”
8380	10	14	23	¶So Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
8381	10	14	24	But the king said, “Let him go over to his own house. He may not see my face.” So Absalom went over to his own house; he did not see the king’s face.
8382	10	14	25	¶Now in all Israel everyone acknowledged that there was no man as handsome as Absalom. From the soles of his feet to the top of his head he was perfect in appearance.
8383	10	14	26	When he would shave his head – at the end of every year he used to shave his head, for it grew too long and he would shave it – he used to weigh the hair of his head at three pounds according to the king’s weight.
8384	10	14	27	Absalom had three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a very attractive woman.
8385	10	14	28	¶Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing the king’s face.
8386	10	14	29	Then Absalom sent a message to Joab asking him to send him to the king, but Joab was not willing to come to him. So he sent a second message to him, but he still was not willing to come.
8387	10	14	30	So he said to his servants, “Look, Joab has a portion of field adjacent to mine and he has some barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set Joab’s portion of the field on fire.
8388	10	14	31	¶Then Joab got up and came to Absalom’s house. He said to him, “Why did your servants set my portion of field on fire?”
8389	10	14	32	Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I sent a message to you saying, ‘Come here so that I can send you to the king with this message: “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there.”’ Let me now see the face of the king. If I am at fault, let him put me to death!”
8390	10	14	33	¶So Joab went to the king and informed him. The king summoned Absalom, and he came to the king. Absalom bowed down before the king with his face toward the ground and the king kissed him.
8391	10	15	1	¶Some time later Absalom managed to acquire a chariot and horses, as well as fifty men to serve as his royal guard.
8392	10	15	2	Now Absalom used to get up early and stand beside the road that led to the city gate. Whenever anyone came by who had a complaint to bring to the king for arbitration, Absalom would call out to him, “What city are you from?” The person would answer, “I, your servant, am from one of the tribes of Israel.”
8393	10	15	3	Absalom would then say to him, “Look, your claims are legitimate and appropriate. But there is no representative of the king who will listen to you.”
8394	10	15	4	Absalom would then say, “If only they would make me a judge in the land! Then everyone who had a judicial complaint could come to me and I would make sure he receives a just settlement.”
8395	10	15	5	¶When someone approached to bow before him, Absalom would extend his hand and embrace him and kiss him.
8396	10	15	6	Absalom acted this way toward everyone in Israel who came to the king for justice. In this way Absalom won the loyalty of the citizens of Israel.
8397	10	15	7	¶After four years Absalom said to the king, “Let me go and repay my vow that I made to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> while I was in Hebron.
8398	10	15	8	For I made this vow when I was living in Geshur in Aram: ‘If the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> really does allow me to return to Jerusalem, I will serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
8399	10	15	9	The king replied to him, “Go in peace.” So Absalom got up and went to Hebron.
8400	10	15	10	¶Then Absalom sent spies through all the tribes of Israel who said, “When you hear the sound of the horn, you may assume that Absalom rules in Hebron.”
8401	10	15	11	Now two hundred men had gone with Absalom from Jerusalem. Since they were invited, they went naively and were unaware of what Absalom was planning.
8402	10	15	12	While he was offering sacrifices, Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s adviser, to come from his city, Giloh. The conspiracy was gaining momentum, and the people were starting to side with Absalom.
8403	10	15	13	¶Then a messenger came to David and reported, “The men of Israel are loyal to Absalom!”
8404	10	15	14	So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, “Come on! Let’s escape! Otherwise no one will be delivered from Absalom! Go immediately, or else he will quickly overtake us and bring disaster on us and kill the city’s residents with the sword.”
8405	10	15	15	The king’s servants replied to the king, “We will do whatever our lord the king decides.”
8406	10	15	16	¶So the king and all the members of his royal court set out on foot, though the king left behind ten concubines to attend to the palace.
8407	10	15	17	The king and all the people set out on foot, pausing at a spot some distance away.
8408	10	15	18	All his servants were leaving with him, along with all the Kerethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites – some six hundred men who had come on foot from Gath. They were leaving with the king.
8409	10	15	19	¶Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you come with us? Go back and stay with the new king, for you are a foreigner and an exile from your own country.
8410	10	15	20	It seems like you arrived just yesterday. Today should I make you wander around by going with us? I go where I must go. But as for you, go back and take your men with you. May genuine loyal love protect you!”
8411	10	15	21	¶But Ittai replied to the king, “As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king is, whether it means death or life, there I will be as well!”
8412	10	15	22	So David said to Ittai, “Come along then.” So Ittai the Gittite went along, accompanied by all his men and all the dependents who were with him.
8413	10	15	23	¶All the land was weeping loudly as all these people were leaving. As the king was crossing over the Kidron Valley, all the people were leaving on the road that leads to the desert.
8414	10	15	24	Zadok and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. When they positioned the ark of God, Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city.
8415	10	15	25	¶Then the king said to Zadok, “Take the ark of God back to the city. If I find favor in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight he will bring me back and enable me to see both it and his dwelling place again.
8416	10	15	26	However, if he should say, ‘I do not take pleasure in you,’ then he will deal with me in a way that he considers appropriate.”
8417	10	15	27	¶The king said to Zadok the priest, “Are you a seer? Go back to the city in peace! Your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan may go with you and Abiathar.
8418	10	15	28	Look, I will be waiting at the fords of the desert until word from you reaches me.”
8419	10	15	29	So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and remained there.
8420	10	15	30	¶As David was going up the Mount of Olives, he was weeping as he went; his head was covered and his feet were bare. All the people who were with him also had their heads covered and were weeping as they went up.
8421	10	15	31	Now David had been told, “Ahithophel has sided with the conspirators who are with Absalom. So David prayed, “Make the advice of Ahithophel foolish, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
8422	10	15	32	¶When David reached the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite met him with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.
8423	10	15	33	David said to him, “If you leave with me you will be a burden to me.
8424	10	15	34	But you will be able to counter the advice of Ahithophel if you go back to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king! Previously I was your father’s servant, and now I will be your servant.’
8425	10	15	35	Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you. Everything you hear in the king’s palace you must tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
8426	10	15	36	Furthermore, their two sons are there with them, Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan. You must send them to me with any information you hear.”
8427	10	15	37	¶So David’s friend Hushai arrived in the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
8428	10	16	1	¶When David had gone a short way beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He had a couple of donkeys that were saddled, and on them were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred raisin cakes, a hundred baskets of summer fruit, and a container of wine.
8429	10	16	2	¶The king asked Ziba, “Why did you bring these things?” Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s family to ride on, the loaves of bread and the summer fruit are for the attendants to eat, and the wine is for those who get exhausted in the desert.”
8430	10	16	3	The king asked, “Where is your master’s grandson?” Ziba replied to the king, “He remains in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will give back to me my grandfather’s kingdom.’”
8431	10	16	4	The king said to Ziba, “Everything that was Mephibosheth’s now belongs to you.” Ziba replied, “I bow before you. May I find favor in your sight, my lord the king.”
8432	10	16	5	¶Then King David reached Bahurim. There a man from Saul’s extended family named Shimei son of Gera came out, yelling curses as he approached.
8433	10	16	6	He threw stones at David and all of King David’s servants, as well as all the people and the soldiers who were on his right and on his left.
8434	10	16	7	As he yelled curses, Shimei said, “Leave! Leave! You man of bloodshed, you wicked man!
8435	10	16	8	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has punished you for all the spilled blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you rule. Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. Disaster has overtaken you, for you are a man of bloodshed!”
8436	10	16	9	¶Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!”
8437	10	16	10	But the king said, “What do we have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said to him, ‘Curse David!’, who can say to him, ‘Why have you done this?’”
8438	10	16	11	Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “My own son, my very own flesh and blood, is trying to take my life. So also now this Benjaminite! Leave him alone so that he can curse, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken to him.
8439	10	16	12	Perhaps the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will notice my affliction and this day grant me good in place of his curse.”
8440	10	16	13	¶So David and his men went on their way. But Shimei kept going along the side of the hill opposite him, yelling curses as he threw stones and dirt at them.
8441	10	16	14	The king and all the people who were with him arrived exhausted at their destination, where David refreshed himself.
8442	10	16	15	¶Now when Absalom and all the men of Israel arrived in Jerusalem, Ahithophel was with him.
8443	10	16	16	When David’s friend Hushai the Arkite came to Absalom, Hushai said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
8444	10	16	17	¶Absalom said to Hushai, “Do you call this loyalty to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?”
8445	10	16	18	Hushai replied to Absalom, “No, I will be loyal to the one whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, these people, and all the men of Israel have chosen.
8446	10	16	19	Moreover, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.”
8447	10	16	20	¶Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give us your advice. What should we do?”
8448	10	16	21	Ahithophel replied to Absalom, “Sleep with your father’s concubines whom he left to care for the palace. All Israel will hear that you have made yourself repulsive to your father. Then your followers will be motivated to support you.”
8449	10	16	22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
8450	10	16	23	¶In those days Ahithophel’s advice was considered as valuable as a prophetic revelation. Both David and Absalom highly regarded the advice of Ahithophel.
8451	10	17	1	¶Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me pick out twelve thousand men. Then I will go and pursue David this very night.
8452	10	17	2	When I catch up with him he will be exhausted and worn out. I will rout him, and the entire army that is with him will flee. I will kill only the king
8453	10	17	3	and will bring the entire army back to you. In exchange for the life of the man you are seeking, you will get back everyone. The entire army will return unharmed.”
8454	10	17	4	¶This seemed like a good idea to Absalom and to all the leaders of Israel.
8455	10	17	5	But Absalom said, “Call for Hushai the Arkite, and let’s hear what he has to say.”
8456	10	17	6	So Hushai came to Absalom. Absalom said to him, “Here is what Ahithophel has advised. Should we follow his advice? If not, what would you recommend?”
8457	10	17	7	¶Hushai replied to Absalom, “Ahithophel’s advice is not sound this time.”
8458	10	17	8	Hushai went on to say, “You know your father and his men – they are soldiers and are as dangerous as a bear out in the wild that has been robbed of her cubs. Your father is an experienced soldier; he will not stay overnight with the army.
8459	10	17	9	At this very moment he is hiding out in one of the caves or in some other similar place. If it should turn out that he attacks our troops first, whoever hears about it will say, ‘Absalom’s army has been slaughtered!’
8460	10	17	10	If that happens even the bravest soldier – one who is lion-hearted – will virtually melt away. For all Israel knows that your father is a warrior and that those who are with him are brave.
8461	10	17	11	My advice therefore is this: Let all Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba – in number like the sand by the sea! – be mustered to you, and you lead them personally into battle.
8462	10	17	12	We will come against him wherever he happens to be found. We will descend on him like the dew falls on the ground. Neither he nor any of the men who are with him will be spared alive – not one of them!
8463	10	17	13	If he regroups in a city, all Israel will take up ropes to that city and drag it down to the valley, so that not a single pebble will be left there!”
8464	10	17	14	¶Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite sounds better than the advice of Ahithophel.” Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had decided to frustrate the sound advice of Ahithophel, so that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> could bring disaster on Absalom.
8465	10	17	15	¶Then Hushai reported to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “Here is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the leaders of Israel to do, and here is what I have advised.
8466	10	17	16	Now send word quickly to David and warn him, “Don’t spend the night at the fords of the wilderness tonight. Instead, be sure you cross over, or else the king and everyone who is with him may be overwhelmed.”
8467	10	17	17	¶Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying in En Rogel. A female servant would go and inform them, and they would then go and inform King David. It was not advisable for them to be seen going into the city.
8468	10	17	18	But a young man saw them on one occasion and informed Absalom. So the two of them quickly departed and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. There was a well in his courtyard, and they got down in it.
8469	10	17	19	His wife then took the covering and spread it over the top of the well and scattered some grain over it. No one was aware of what she had done.
8470	10	17	20	¶When the servants of Absalom approached the woman at her home, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” The woman replied to them, “They crossed over the stream.” Absalom’s men searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.
8471	10	17	21	¶After the men had left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed out of the well. Then they left and informed King David. They advised David, “Get up and cross the stream quickly, for Ahithophel has devised a plan to catch you.”
8472	10	17	22	So David and all the people who were with him got up and crossed the Jordan River. By dawn there was not one person left who had not crossed the Jordan.
8473	10	17	23	¶When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and returned to his house in his hometown. After setting his household in order, he hanged himself. So he died and was buried in the grave of his father.
8474	10	17	24	¶Meanwhile David had gone to Mahanaim, while Absalom and all the men of Israel had crossed the Jordan River.
8475	10	17	25	Absalom had made Amasa general in command of the army in place of Joab. (Now Amasa was the son of an Israelite man named Jether, who had married Abigail the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.)
8476	10	17	26	The army of Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
8477	10	17	27	¶When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim
8478	10	17	28	brought bedding, basins, and pottery utensils. They also brought food for David and all who were with him, including wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,
8479	10	17	29	honey, curds, flocks, and cheese. For they said, “The people are no doubt hungry, tired, and thirsty there in the desert.”
8480	10	18	1	¶David assembled the army that was with him. He appointed leaders of thousands and leaders of hundreds.
8481	10	18	2	David then sent out the army – a third under the leadership of Joab, a third under the leadership of Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under the leadership of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the troops, “I too will indeed march out with you.”
8482	10	18	3	¶But the soldiers replied, “You should not do this! For if we should have to make a rapid retreat, they won’t be too concerned about us. Even if half of us should die, they won’t be too concerned about us. But you are like ten thousand of us! So it is better if you remain in the city for support.”
8483	10	18	4	Then the king said to them, “I will do whatever seems best to you.”¶So the king stayed beside the city gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands.
8484	10	18	5	The king gave this order to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: “For my sake deal gently with the young man Absalom.” Now the entire army was listening when the king gave all the leaders this order concerning Absalom.
8485	10	18	6	¶Then the army marched out to the field to fight against Israel. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
8486	10	18	7	The army of Israel was defeated there by David’s men. The slaughter there was great that day – 20,000 soldiers were killed.
8487	10	18	8	The battle there was spread out over the whole area, and the forest consumed more soldiers than the sword devoured that day.
8488	10	18	9	¶Then Absalom happened to come across David’s men. Now as Absalom was riding on his mule, it went under the branches of a large oak tree. His head got caught in the oak and he was suspended in midair, while the mule he had been riding kept going.
8489	10	18	10	¶When one of the men saw this, he reported it to Joab saying, “I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.”
8490	10	18	11	Joab replied to the man who was telling him this, “What! You saw this? Why didn’t you strike him down right on the spot? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a commemorative belt!”
8491	10	18	12	¶The man replied to Joab, “Even if I were receiving a thousand pieces of silver, I would not strike the king’s son! In our very presence the king gave this order to you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.’
8492	10	18	13	If I had acted at risk of my own life – and nothing is hidden from the king! – you would have abandoned me.”
8493	10	18	14	¶Joab replied, “I will not wait around like this for you!” He took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the middle of Absalom while he was still alive in the middle of the oak tree.
8494	10	18	15	Then ten soldiers who were Joab’s armor bearers struck Absalom and finished him off.
8495	10	18	16	¶Then Joab blew the trumpet and the army turned back from chasing Israel, for Joab had called for the army to halt.
8496	10	18	17	They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and stacked a huge pile of stones over him. In the meantime all the Israelite soldiers fled to their homes.
8497	10	18	18	¶Prior to this Absalom had set up a monument and dedicated it to himself in the King’s Valley, reasoning “I have no son who will carry on my name.” He named the monument after himself, and to this day it is known as Absalom’s Memorial.
8498	10	18	19	¶Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me run and give the king the good news that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has vindicated him before his enemies.”
8499	10	18	20	But Joab said to him, “You will not be a bearer of good news today. You will bear good news some other day, but not today, for the king’s son is dead.”
8500	10	18	21	¶Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go and tell the king what you have seen.” After bowing to Joab, the Cushite ran off.
8501	10	18	22	Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again spoke to Joab, “Whatever happens, let me go after the Cushite.” But Joab said, “Why is it that you want to go, my son? You have no good news that will bring you a reward.”
8502	10	18	23	But he said, “Whatever happens, I want to go!” So Joab said to him, “Then go!” So Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Jordan plain, and he passed the Cushite.
8503	10	18	24	¶Now David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate at the wall. When he looked, he saw a man running by himself.
8504	10	18	25	So the watchman called out and informed the king. The king said, “If he is by himself, he brings good news.” The runner came ever closer.
8505	10	18	26	¶Then the watchman saw another man running. The watchman called out to the gatekeeper, “There is another man running by himself.” The king said, “This one also is bringing good news.”
8506	10	18	27	The watchman said, “It appears to me that the first runner is Ahimaaz son of Zadok.” The king said, “He is a good man, and he comes with good news.”
8507	10	18	28	¶Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “Greetings!” He bowed down before the king with his face toward the ground and said, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God be praised because he has defeated the men who opposed my lord the king!”
8508	10	18	29	¶The king replied, “How is the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz replied, “I saw a great deal of confusion when Joab was sending the king’s servant and me, your servant, but I don’t know what it was all about.”
8509	10	18	30	The king said, “Turn aside and take your place here.” So he turned aside and waited.
8510	10	18	31	¶Then the Cushite arrived and said, “May my lord the king now receive the good news! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has vindicated you today and delivered you from the hand of all who have rebelled against you!”
8511	10	18	32	The king asked the Cushite, “How is the young man Absalom?” The Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who have plotted against you be like that young man!”
8512	10	18	33	¶(19:1) The king then became very upset. He went up to the upper room over the gate and wept. As he went he said, “My son, Absalom! My son, my son, Absalom! If only I could have died in your place! Absalom, my son, my son!”
8513	10	19	1	¶(19:2) Joab was told, “The king is weeping and mourning over Absalom.”
8514	10	19	2	So the victory of that day was turned to mourning as far as all the people were concerned. For the people heard on that day, “The king is grieved over his son.”
8515	10	19	3	That day the people stole away to go to the city the way people who are embarrassed steal away in fleeing from battle.
8516	10	19	4	The king covered his face and cried out loudly, “My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!”
8517	10	19	5	¶So Joab visited the king at his home. He said, “Today you have embarrassed all your servants who have saved your life this day, as well as the lives of your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your concubines.
8518	10	19	6	You seem to love your enemies and hate your friends! For you have as much as declared today that leaders and servants don’t matter to you. I realize now that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, it would be all right with you.
8519	10	19	7	So get up now and go out and give some encouragement to your servants. For I swear by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that if you don’t go out there, not a single man will stay here with you tonight! This disaster will be worse for you than any disaster that has overtaken you from your youth right to the present time!”
8520	10	19	8	¶So the king got up and sat at the city gate. When all the people were informed that the king was sitting at the city gate, they all came before him.¶But the Israelite soldiers had all fled to their own homes.
8521	10	19	9	All the people throughout all the tribes of Israel were arguing among themselves saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies. He rescued us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.
8522	10	19	10	But Absalom, whom we anointed as our king, has died in battle. So now why do you hesitate to bring the king back?”
8523	10	19	11	¶Then King David sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests saying, “Tell the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you delay any further in bringing the king back to his palace, when everything Israel is saying has come to the king’s attention.
8524	10	19	12	You are my brothers – my very own flesh and blood! Why should you delay any further in bringing the king back?’
8525	10	19	13	Say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my flesh and blood? God will punish me severely, if from this time on you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab!’”
8526	10	19	14	¶He won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man. Then they sent word to the king saying, “Return, you and all your servants as well.”
8527	10	19	15	So the king returned and came to the Jordan River. ¶Now the people of Judah had come to Gilgal to meet the king and to help him cross the Jordan.
8528	10	19	16	Shimei son of Gera the Benjaminite from Bahurim came down quickly with the men of Judah to meet King David.
8529	10	19	17	There were a thousand men from Benjamin with him, along with Ziba the servant of Saul’s household, and with him his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They hurriedly crossed the Jordan within sight of the king.
8530	10	19	18	They crossed at the ford in order to help the king’s household cross and to do whatever he thought appropriate.¶Now after he had crossed the Jordan, Shimei son of Gera threw himself down before the king.
8531	10	19	19	He said to the king, “Don’t think badly of me, my lord, and don’t recall the sin of your servant on the day when you, my lord the king, left Jerusalem! Please don’t call it to mind!
8532	10	19	20	For I, your servant, know that I sinned, and I have come today as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.”
8533	10	19	21	¶Abishai son of Zeruiah replied, “For this should not Shimei be put to death? After all, he cursed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anointed!”
8534	10	19	22	But David said, “What do we have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? You are like my enemy today! Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don’t I know that today I am king over Israel?”
8535	10	19	23	The king said to Shimei, “You won’t die.” The king vowed an oath concerning this.
8536	10	19	24	¶Now Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, came down to meet the king. From the day the king had left until the day he safely returned, Mephibosheth had not cared for his feet nor trimmed his mustache nor washed his clothes.
8537	10	19	25	¶When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”
8538	10	19	26	He replied, “My lord the king, my servant deceived me! I said, ‘Let me get my donkey saddled so that I can ride on it and go with the king,’ for I am lame.
8539	10	19	27	But my servant has slandered me to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like an angel of God. Do whatever seems appropriate to you.
8540	10	19	28	After all, there was no one in the entire house of my grandfather who did not deserve death from my lord the king. But instead you allowed me to eat at your own table! What further claim do I have to ask the king for anything?”
8541	10	19	29	¶Then the king replied to him, “Why should you continue speaking like this? You and Ziba will inherit the field together.”
8542	10	19	30	Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him have the whole thing! My lord the king has returned safely to his house!”
8543	10	19	31	¶Now when Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim, he crossed the Jordan with the king so he could send him on his way from there.
8544	10	19	32	But Barzillai was very old – eighty years old, in fact – and he had taken care of the king when he stayed in Mahanaim, for he was a very rich man.
8545	10	19	33	So the king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me, and I will take care of you while you are with me in Jerusalem.”
8546	10	19	34	¶Barzillai replied to the king, “How many days do I have left to my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
8547	10	19	35	I am presently eighty years old. Am I able to discern good and bad? Can I taste what I eat and drink? Am I still able to hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should I continue to be a burden to my lord the king?
8548	10	19	36	I will cross the Jordan with the king and go a short distance. Why should the king reward me in this way?
8549	10	19	37	Let me return so that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. But look, here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever seems appropriate to you.”
8550	10	19	38	¶The king replied, “Kimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever I deem appropriate. And whatever you choose, I will do for you.”
8551	10	19	39	¶So all the people crossed the Jordan, as did the king. After the king had kissed him and blessed him, Barzillai returned to his home.
8552	10	19	40	When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed over with him. Now all the soldiers of Judah along with half of the soldiers of Israel had helped the king cross over.
8553	10	19	41	¶Then all the men of Israel began coming to the king. They asked the king, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, sneak the king away and help the king and his household cross the Jordan – and not only him but all of David’s men as well?”
8554	10	19	42	All the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, “Because the king is our close relative! Why are you so upset about this? Have we eaten at the king’s expense? Or have we misappropriated anything for our own use?”
8555	10	19	43	The men of Israel replied to the men of Judah, “We have ten shares in the king, and we have a greater claim on David than you do! Why do you want to curse us? Weren’t we the first to suggest bringing back our king?” But the comments of the men of Judah were more severe than those of the men of Israel.
8556	10	20	1	¶Now a wicked man named Sheba son of Bicri, a Benjaminite, happened to be there. He blew the trumpet and said,‡“We have no share in David; ‡we have no inheritance in this son of Jesse!‡Every man go home, O Israel!”
8557	10	20	2	¶So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stuck by their king all the way from the Jordan River to Jerusalem.
8558	10	20	3	¶Then David went to his palace in Jerusalem. The king took the ten concubines he had left to care for the palace and placed them under confinement. Though he provided for their needs, he did not sleep with them. They remained under restriction until the day they died, living out the rest of their lives as widows.
8559	10	20	4	¶Then the king said to Amasa, “Call the men of Judah together for me in three days, and you be present here with them too.”
8560	10	20	5	So Amasa went out to call Judah together. But in doing so he took longer than the time that the king had allotted him.
8561	10	20	6	¶Then David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba son of Bicri will cause greater disaster for us than Absalom did! Take your lord’s servants and pursue him. Otherwise he will secure fortified cities for himself and get away from us.”
8562	10	20	7	So Joab’s men, accompanied by the Kerethites, the Pelethites, and all the warriors, left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.
8563	10	20	8	¶When they were near the big rock that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to them. Now Joab was dressed in military attire and had a dagger in its sheath belted to his waist. When he advanced, it fell out.
8564	10	20	9	¶Joab said to Amasa, “How are you, my brother?” With his right hand Joab took hold of Amasa’s beard as if to greet him with a kiss.
8565	10	20	10	Amasa did not protect himself from the knife in Joab’s other hand, and Joab stabbed him in the abdomen, causing Amasa’s intestines to spill out on the ground. There was no need to stab him again; the first blow was fatal. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bicri.
8566	10	20	11	¶One of Joab’s soldiers who stood over Amasa said, “Whoever is for Joab and whoever is for David, follow Joab!”
8567	10	20	12	Amasa was squirming in his own blood in the middle of the path, and this man had noticed that all the soldiers stopped. Having noticed that everyone who came across Amasa stopped, the man pulled him away from the path and into the field and threw a garment over him.
8568	10	20	13	Once he had removed Amasa from the path, everyone followed Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.
8569	10	20	14	¶Sheba traveled through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth Maacah and all the Berite region. When they had assembled, they too joined him.
8570	10	20	15	So Joab’s men came and laid siege against him in Abel of Beth Maacah. They prepared a siege ramp outside the city which stood against its outer rampart. As all of Joab’s soldiers were trying to break through the wall so that it would collapse,
8571	10	20	16	a wise woman called out from the city, “Listen up! Listen up! Tell Joab, ‘Come near so that I may speak to you.’”
8572	10	20	17	¶When he approached her, the woman asked, “Are you Joab?” He replied, “I am.” She said to him, “Listen to the words of your servant.” He said, “Go ahead. I’m listening.”
8573	10	20	18	She said, “In the past they would always say, ‘Let them inquire in Abel,’ and that is how they settled things.
8574	10	20	19	I represent the peaceful and the faithful in Israel. You are attempting to destroy an important city in Israel. Why should you swallow up the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s inheritance?”
8575	10	20	20	¶Joab answered, “Get serious! I don’t want to swallow up or destroy anything!
8576	10	20	21	That’s not the way things are. There is a man from the hill country of Ephraim named Sheba son of Bicri. He has rebelled against King David. Give me just this one man, and I will leave the city.” The woman said to Joab, “This very minute his head will be thrown over the wall to you!”
8577	10	20	22	¶Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice and they cut off Sheba’s head and threw it out to Joab. Joab blew the trumpet, and his men dispersed from the city, each going to his own home. Joab returned to the king in Jerusalem.
8578	10	20	23	¶Now Joab was the general in command of all the army of Israel. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and the Perethites.
8579	10	20	24	Adoniram was supervisor of the work crews. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the secretary.
8580	10	20	25	Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.
8581	10	20	26	Ira the Jairite was David’s personal priest.
8582	10	21	1	¶During David’s reign there was a famine for three consecutive years. So David inquired of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “It is because of Saul and his bloodstained family, because he murdered the Gibeonites.”
8583	10	21	2	¶So the king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke with them. (Now the Gibeonites were not descendants of Israel; they were a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had made a promise to them, but Saul tried to kill them because of his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.)
8584	10	21	3	David said to the Gibeonites, “What can I do for you, and how can I make amends so that you will bless the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s inheritance?”
8585	10	21	4	¶The Gibeonites said to him, “We have no claim to silver or gold from Saul or from his family, nor would we be justified in putting to death anyone in Israel.” David asked, “What then are you asking me to do for you?”
8586	10	21	5	They replied to the king, “As for this man who exterminated us and who schemed against us so that we were destroyed and left without status throughout all the borders of Israel –
8587	10	21	6	let seven of his male descendants be turned over to us, and we will execute them before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in Gibeah of Saul, who was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s chosen one.” The king replied, “I will turn them over.”
8588	10	21	7	¶The king had mercy on Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, in light of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s oath that had been taken between David and Jonathan son of Saul.
8589	10	21	8	So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah’s daughter Rizpah whom she had born to Saul, and the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab whom she had born to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
8590	10	21	9	He turned them over to the Gibeonites, and they executed them on a hill before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The seven of them died together; they were put to death during harvest time – during the first days of the beginning of the barley harvest.
8591	10	21	10	¶Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest until the rain fell on them, she did not allow the birds of the air to feed on them by day, nor the wild animals by night.
8592	10	21	11	When David was told what Rizpah daughter of Aiah, Saul’s concubine, had done,
8593	10	21	12	he went and took the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan from the leaders of Jabesh Gilead. (They had secretly taken them from the plaza at Beth Shan. It was there that Philistines publicly exposed their corpses after they had killed Saul at Gilboa.)
8594	10	21	13	David brought the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son from there; they also gathered up the bones of those who had been executed.
8595	10	21	14	¶They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin at Zela in the grave of his father Kish. After they had done everything that the king had commanded, God responded to their prayers for the land.
8596	10	21	15	¶Another battle was fought between the Philistines and Israel. So David went down with his soldiers and fought the Philistines. David became exhausted.
8597	10	21	16	Now Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha, had a spear that weighed three hundred bronze shekels, and he was armed with a new weapon. He had said that he would kill David.
8598	10	21	17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to David’s aid, striking the Philistine down and killing him. Then David’s men took an oath saying, “You will not go out to battle with us again! You must not extinguish the lamp of Israel!”
8599	10	21	18	¶Later there was another battle with the Philistines, this time in Gob. On that occasion Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the descendants of Rapha.
8600	10	21	19	Yet another battle occurred with the Philistines in Gob. On that occasion Elhanan the son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
8601	10	21	20	Yet another battle occurred in Gath. On that occasion there was a large man who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all! He too was a descendant of Rapha.
8602	10	21	21	When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, killed him.
8603	10	21	22	These four were the descendants of Rapha who lived in Gath; they were killed by David and his soldiers.
8604	10	22	1	¶David sang to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> the words of this song when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rescued him from the power of all his enemies, including Saul.
8605	10	22	2	He said:‡“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is my high ridge, my stronghold, my deliverer.
8606	10	22	3	‡My God is my rocky summit where I take shelter, ‡my shield, the horn that saves me, my stronghold,‡my refuge, my savior. You save me from violence!
8607	10	22	4	‡I called to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who is worthy of praise, ‡and I was delivered from my enemies.
8608	10	22	5	‡The waves of death engulfed me;‡the currents of chaos overwhelmed me.
8609	10	22	6	‡The ropes of Sheol tightened around me; ‡the snares of death trapped me.
8610	10	22	7	‡In my distress I called to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡I called to my God. ‡From his heavenly temple he heard my voice;‡he listened to my cry for help.
8611	10	22	8	‡The earth heaved and shook; ‡the foundations of the sky trembled. ‡They heaved because he was angry.
8612	10	22	9	‡Smoke ascended from his nose; ‡fire devoured as it came from his mouth; ‡he hurled down fiery coals.
8613	10	22	10	‡He made the sky sink as he descended;‡a thick cloud was under his feet.
8614	10	22	11	‡He mounted a winged angel and flew;‡he glided on the wings of the wind.
8615	10	22	12	‡He shrouded himself in darkness, ‡in thick rain clouds.
8616	10	22	13	‡From the brightness in front of him ‡came coals of fire.
8617	10	22	14	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> thundered from the sky;‡the Most High shouted loudly.
8618	10	22	15	‡He shot arrows and scattered them, ‡lightning and routed them.
8619	10	22	16	‡The depths of the sea were exposed;‡the inner regions of the world were uncovered‡by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s battle cry, ‡by the powerful breath from his nose.
8620	10	22	17	‡He reached down from above and grabbed me; ‡he pulled me from the surging water.
8621	10	22	18	‡He rescued me from my strong enemy, ‡from those who hate me, ‡for they were too strong for me.
8622	10	22	19	‡They confronted me in my day of calamity,‡but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> helped me.
8623	10	22	20	‡He brought me out into a wide open place;‡he delivered me because he was pleased with me.
8624	10	22	21	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> repaid me for my godly deeds; ‡he rewarded my blameless behavior.
8625	10	22	22	‡For I have obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commands; ‡I have not rebelled against my God.
8626	10	22	23	‡For I am aware of all his regulations, ‡and I do not reject his rules.
8627	10	22	24	‡I was blameless before him;‡I kept myself from sinning.
8628	10	22	25	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rewarded me for my godly deeds; ‡he took notice of my blameless behavior.
8629	10	22	26	‡You prove to be loyal to one who is faithful; ‡you prove to be trustworthy to one who is innocent.
8630	10	22	27	‡You prove to be reliable to one who is blameless,‡but you prove to be deceptive to one who is perverse.
8631	10	22	28	‡You deliver oppressed people,‡but you watch<sup></sup> the proud and bring them down.
8632	10	22	29	‡Indeed, you are my lamp, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> illumines the darkness around me.
8633	10	22	30	‡Indeed, with your help I can charge against an army; ‡by my God’s power I can jump over a wall.
8634	10	22	31	‡The one true God acts in a faithful manner; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s promise is reliable; ‡he is a shield to all who take shelter in him.
8635	10	22	32	‡Indeed, who is God besides the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?‡Who is a protector besides our God?
8636	10	22	33	‡The one true God is my mighty refuge; ‡he removes the obstacles in my way.
8637	10	22	34	‡He gives me the agility of a deer; ‡he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain.
8638	10	22	35	‡He trains my hands for battle; ‡my arms can bend even the strongest bow.
8639	10	22	36	‡You give me your protective shield; ‡your willingness to help enables me to prevail.
8640	10	22	37	‡You widen my path; ‡my feet do not slip.
8641	10	22	38	‡I chase my enemies and destroy them;‡I do not turn back until I wipe them out.
8642	10	22	39	‡I wipe them out and beat them to death;‡they cannot get up;‡they fall at my feet.
8643	10	22	40	‡You give me strength for battle; ‡you make my foes kneel before me.
8644	10	22	41	‡You make my enemies retreat; ‡I destroy those who hate me.
8645	10	22	42	‡They cry out, but there is no one to help them; ‡they cry out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, but he does not answer them.
8646	10	22	43	‡I grind them as fine as the dust of the ground;‡I crush them and stomp on them like clay in the streets.
8647	10	22	44	‡You rescue me from a hostile army; ‡you preserve me as a leader of nations;‡people over whom I had no authority are now my subjects.
8648	10	22	45	‡Foreigners are powerless before me; ‡when they hear of my exploits, they submit to me.
8649	10	22	46	‡Foreigners lose their courage; ‡they shake with fear as they leave their strongholds.
8650	10	22	47	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is alive! ‡My protector is praiseworthy! ‡The God who delivers me is exalted as king!
8651	10	22	48	‡The one true God completely vindicates me; ‡he makes nations submit to me.
8652	10	22	49	‡He delivers me from my enemies; ‡you snatch me away from those who attack me; ‡you rescue me from violent men.
8653	10	22	50	‡So I will give you thanks, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, before the nations! ‡I will sing praises to you.
8654	10	22	51	‡He gives his king magnificent victories; ‡he is faithful to his chosen ruler, ‡to David and to his descendants forever!”
8655	10	23	1	¶These are the final words of David:‡“The oracle of David son of Jesse,‡the oracle of the man raised up as‡the ruler chosen by the God of Jacob, ‡Israel’s beloved singer of songs:
8656	10	23	2	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit spoke through me;‡his word was on my tongue.
8657	10	23	3	‡The God of Israel spoke,‡the protector of Israel spoke to me.‡The one who rules fairly among men,‡the one who rules in the fear of God,
8658	10	23	4	‡is like the light of morning when the sun comes up,‡a morning in which there are no clouds.‡He is like the brightness after rain‡that produces grass from the earth.
8659	10	23	5	‡My dynasty is approved by God, ‡for he has made a perpetual covenant with me,‡arranged in all its particulars and secured.‡He always delivers me,‡and brings all I desire to fruition.
8660	10	23	6	‡But evil people are like thorns – ‡all of them are tossed away,‡for they cannot be held in the hand.
8661	10	23	7	‡The one who touches them‡must use an iron instrument‡or the wooden shaft of a spear.‡They are completely burned up right where they lie!”
8662	10	23	8	¶These are the names of David’s warriors:¶Josheb-Basshebeth, a Tahkemonite, was head of the officers. He killed eight hundred men with his spear in one battle.
8663	10	23	9	Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo, the son of Ahohi. He was one of the three warriors who were with David when they defied the Philistines who were assembled there for battle. When the men of Israel retreated,
8664	10	23	10	he stood his ground and fought the Philistines until his hand grew so tired that it seemed stuck to his sword. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave a great victory on that day. When the army returned to him, the only thing left to do was to plunder the corpses.
8665	10	23	11	¶Next in command was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines assembled at Lehi, where there happened to be an area of a field that was full of lentils, the army retreated before the Philistines.
8666	10	23	12	But he made a stand in the middle of that area. He defended it and defeated the Philistines; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave them a great victory.
8667	10	23	13	¶At the time of the harvest three of the thirty leaders went down to David at the cave of Adullam. A band of Philistines was camped in the valley of Rephaim.
8668	10	23	14	David was in the stronghold at the time, while a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem.
8669	10	23	15	David was thirsty and said, “How I wish someone would give me some water to drink from the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate!”
8670	10	23	16	So the three elite warriors broke through the Philistine forces and drew some water from the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate. They carried it back to David, but he refused to drink it. He poured it out as a drink offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>
8671	10	23	17	and said, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I will not do this! It is equivalent to the blood of the men who risked their lives by going.” So he refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three elite warriors.
8672	10	23	18	¶Abishai son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, was head of the three. He killed three hundred men with his spear and gained fame among the three.
8673	10	23	19	From the three he was given honor and he became their officer, even though he was not one of the three.
8674	10	23	20	¶Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave warrior from Kabzeel who performed great exploits. He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in a cistern on a snowy day.
8675	10	23	21	He also killed an impressive-looking Egyptian. The Egyptian wielded a spear, while Benaiah attacked him with a club. He grabbed the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
8676	10	23	22	Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who gained fame among the three elite warriors.
8677	10	23	23	He received honor from the thirty warriors, though he was not one of the three elite warriors. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
8678	10	23	24	¶Included with the thirty were the following: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,
8679	10	23	25	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
8680	10	23	26	Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,
8681	10	23	27	Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
8682	10	23	28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
8683	10	23	29	Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin,
8684	10	23	30	Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the wadis of Gaash,
8685	10	23	31	Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
8686	10	23	32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan
8687	10	23	33	son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,
8688	10	23	34	Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maacathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
8689	10	23	35	Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
8690	10	23	36	Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
8691	10	23	37	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite (the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah),
8692	10	23	38	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite
8693	10	23	39	and Uriah the Hittite. Altogether there were thirty-seven.
8694	10	24	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anger again raged against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, “Go count Israel and Judah.”
8695	10	24	2	The king told Joab, the general in command of his army, “Go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba and muster the army, so I may know the size of the army.”
8696	10	24	3	¶Joab replied to the king, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God make the army a hundred times larger right before the eyes of my lord the king! But why does my master the king want to do this?”
8697	10	24	4	¶But the king’s edict stood, despite the objections of Joab and the leaders of the army. So Joab and the leaders of the army left the king’s presence in order to muster the Israelite army.
8698	10	24	5	¶They crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer, on the south side of the city, at the wadi of Gad, near Jazer.
8699	10	24	6	Then they went on to Gilead and to the region of Tahtim Hodshi, coming to Dan Jaan and on around to Sidon.
8700	10	24	7	Then they went to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went on to the Negev of Judah, to Beer Sheba.
8701	10	24	8	They went through all the land and after nine months and twenty days came back to Jerusalem.
8702	10	24	9	¶Joab reported the number of warriors to the king. In Israel there were 800,000 sword-wielding warriors, and in Judah there were 500,000 soldiers.
8703	10	24	10	¶David felt guilty after he had numbered the army. David said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “I have sinned greatly by doing this! Now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, please remove the guilt of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
8704	10	24	11	¶When David got up the next morning, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message had already come to the prophet Gad, David’s seer:
8705	10	24	12	“Go, tell David, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: I am offering you three forms of judgment. Pick one of them and I will carry it out against you.’”
8706	10	24	13	¶Gad went to David and told him, “Shall seven years of famine come upon your land? Or shall you flee for three months from your enemy with him in hot pursuit? Or shall there be three days of plague in your land? Now decide what I should tell the one who sent me.”
8707	10	24	14	David said to Gad, “I am very upset! I prefer that we be attacked by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for his mercy is great; I do not want to be attacked by men!”
8708	10	24	15	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent a plague through Israel from the morning until the completion of the appointed time. Seventy thousand men died from Dan to Beer Sheba.
8709	10	24	16	When the angel extended his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> relented from his judgment. He told the angel who was killing the people, “That’s enough! Stop now!” (Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel was near the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.)
8710	10	24	17	¶When he saw the angel who was destroying the people, David said to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Look, it is I who have sinned and done this evil thing! As for these sheep – what have they done? Attack me and my family.”
8711	10	24	18	¶So Gad went to David that day and told him, “Go up and build an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
8712	10	24	19	So David went up as Gad instructed him to do, according to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s instructions.
8713	10	24	20	¶When Araunah looked out and saw the king and his servants approaching him, he went out and bowed to the king with his face to the ground.
8714	10	24	21	Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David replied, “To buy from you the threshing floor so I can build an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, so that the plague may be removed from the people.”
8715	10	24	22	Araunah told David, “My lord the king may take whatever he wishes and offer it. Look! Here are oxen for burnt offerings, and threshing sledges and harnesses for wood.
8716	10	24	23	I, the servant of my lord the king, give it all to the king!” Araunah also told the king, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God show you favor!”
8717	10	24	24	But the king said to Araunah, “No, I insist on buying it from you! I will not offer to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.”¶So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty pieces of silver.
8718	10	24	25	Then David built an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> there and offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings. And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> accepted prayers for the land, and the plague was removed from Israel.
8719	11	1	1	¶King David was very old; even when they covered him with blankets, he could not get warm.
8720	11	1	2	His servants advised him, “A young virgin must be found for our master, the king, to take care of the king’s needs and serve as his nurse. She can also sleep with you and keep our master, the king, warm.”
8721	11	1	3	So they looked through all Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
8722	11	1	4	The young woman was very beautiful; she became the king’s nurse and served him, but the king was not intimate with her.
8723	11	1	5	¶Now Adonijah, son of David and Haggith, was promoting himself, boasting, “I will be king!” He managed to acquire chariots and horsemen, as well as fifty men to serve as his royal guard.
8724	11	1	6	(Now his father had never corrected him by saying, “Why do you do such things?” He was also very handsome and had been born right after Absalom.)
8725	11	1	7	He collaborated with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they supported him.
8726	11	1	8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David’s elite warriors did not ally themselves with Adonijah.
8727	11	1	9	Adonijah sacrificed sheep, cattle, and fattened steers at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, as well as all the men of Judah, the king’s servants.
8728	11	1	10	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the elite warriors, or his brother Solomon.
8729	11	1	11	¶Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Has it been reported to you that Haggith’s son Adonijah has become king behind our master David’s back?
8730	11	1	12	Now let me give you some advice as to how you can save your life and your son Solomon’s life.
8731	11	1	13	Visit King David and say to him, ‘My master, O king, did you not solemnly promise your servant, “Surely your son Solomon will be king after me; he will sit on my throne”? So why has Adonijah become king?’
8732	11	1	14	While you are still there speaking to the king, I will arrive and verify your report.”
8733	11	1	15	¶So Bathsheba visited the king in his private quarters. (The king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.)
8734	11	1	16	Bathsheba bowed down on the floor before the king. The king said, “What do you want?”
8735	11	1	17	She replied to him, “My master, you swore an oath to your servant by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, ‘Solomon your son will be king after me and he will sit on my throne.’
8736	11	1	18	But now, look, Adonijah has become king! But you, my master the king, are not even aware of it!
8737	11	1	19	He has sacrificed many cattle, steers, and sheep and has invited all the king’s sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab, the commander of the army, but he has not invited your servant Solomon.
8738	11	1	20	Now, my master, O king, all Israel is watching anxiously to see who is named to succeed my master the king on the throne.
8739	11	1	21	If a decision is not made, when my master the king is buried with his ancestors, my son Solomon and I will be considered state criminals.”
8740	11	1	22	¶Just then, while she was still speaking to the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.
8741	11	1	23	The king was told, “Nathan the prophet is here.” Nathan entered and bowed before the king with his face to the floor.
8742	11	1	24	Nathan said, “My master, O king, did you announce, ‘Adonijah will be king after me; he will sit on my throne’?
8743	11	1	25	For today he has gone down and sacrificed many cattle, steers, and sheep and has invited all the king’s sons, the army commanders, and Abiathar the priest. At this moment they are having a feast in his presence, and they have declared, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’
8744	11	1	26	But he did not invite me – your servant – or Zadok the priest, or Benaiah son of Jehoiada, or your servant Solomon.
8745	11	1	27	Has my master the king authorized this without informing your servants who should succeed my master the king on his throne?”
8746	11	1	28	¶King David responded, “Summon Bathsheba!” She came and stood before the king.
8747	11	1	29	The king swore an oath: “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives (he who has rescued me from every danger),
8748	11	1	30	I will keep today the oath I swore to you by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel: ‘Surely Solomon your son will be king after me; he will sit in my place on my throne.’”
8749	11	1	31	Bathsheba bowed down to the king with her face to the floor and said, “May my master, King David, live forever!”
8750	11	1	32	¶King David said, “Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” They came before the king,
8751	11	1	33	and he told them, “Take your master’s servants with you, put my son Solomon on my mule, and lead him down to Gihon.
8752	11	1	34	There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet will anoint him king over Israel; then blow the trumpet and declare, ‘Long live King Solomon!’
8753	11	1	35	Then follow him up as he comes and sits on my throne. He will be king in my place; I have decreed that he will be ruler over Israel and Judah.”
8754	11	1	36	Benaiah son of Jehoiada responded to the king: “So be it! May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of my master the king confirm it!
8755	11	1	37	As the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with my master the king, so may he be with Solomon, and may he make him an even greater king than my master King David!”
8756	11	1	38	¶So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites went down, put Solomon on King David’s mule, and led him to Gihon.
8757	11	1	39	Zadok the priest took a horn filled with olive oil from the tent and poured it on Solomon; the trumpet was blown and all the people declared, “Long live King Solomon!”
8758	11	1	40	All the people followed him up, playing flutes and celebrating so loudly they made the ground shake.
8759	11	1	41	¶Now Adonijah and all his guests heard the commotion just as they had finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he asked, “Why is there such a noisy commotion in the city?”
8760	11	1	42	As he was still speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, “Come in, for an important man like you must be bringing good news.”
8761	11	1	43	Jonathan replied to Adonijah: “No! Our master King David has made Solomon king.
8762	11	1	44	The king sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites and they put him on the king’s mule.
8763	11	1	45	Then Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him king in Gihon. They went up from there rejoicing, and the city is in an uproar. That is the sound you hear.
8764	11	1	46	Furthermore, Solomon has assumed the royal throne.
8765	11	1	47	The king’s servants have even come to congratulate our master King David, saying, ‘May your God make Solomon more famous than you and make him an even greater king than you!’ Then the king leaned on the bed
8766	11	1	48	and said this: ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel is worthy of praise because today he has placed a successor on my throne and allowed me to see it.’”
8767	11	1	49	¶All of Adonijah’s guests panicked; they jumped up and rushed off their separate ways.
8768	11	1	50	Adonijah feared Solomon, so he got up and went and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar.
8769	11	1	51	Solomon was told, “Look, Adonijah fears you; see, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘May King Solomon solemnly promise me today that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’”
8770	11	1	52	Solomon said, “If he is a loyal subject, not a hair of his head will be harmed, but if he is found to be a traitor, he will die.”
8771	11	1	53	King Solomon sent men to bring him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon told him, “Go home.”
8772	11	2	1	¶When David was close to death, he told Solomon his son:
8773	11	2	2	“I am about to die. Be strong and become a man!
8774	11	2	3	Do the job the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has assigned you by following his instructions and obeying his rules, commandments, regulations, and laws as written in the law of Moses. Then you will succeed in all you do and seek to accomplish,
8775	11	2	4	and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will fulfill his promise to me, ‘If your descendants watch their step and live faithfully in my presence with all their heart and being, then,’ he promised, ‘you will not fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’
8776	11	2	5	¶“You know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me – how he murdered two commanders of the Israelite armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. During peacetime he struck them down like he would in battle; when he shed their blood as if in battle, he stained the belt on his waist and the sandals on his feet.
8777	11	2	6	Do to him what you think is appropriate, but don’t let him live long and die a peaceful death.
8778	11	2	7	¶“Treat fairly the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and provide for their needs, because they helped me when I had to flee from your brother Absalom.
8779	11	2	8	¶“Note well, you still have to contend with Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who tried to call down upon me a horrible judgment when I went to Mahanaim. He came down and met me at the Jordan, and I solemnly promised him by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‘I will not strike you down with the sword.’
8780	11	2	9	But now don’t treat him as if he were innocent. You are a wise man and you know how to handle him; make sure he has a bloody death.”
8781	11	2	10	¶Then David passed away and was buried in the City of David.
8782	11	2	11	David reigned over Israel forty years; he reigned in Hebron seven years, and in Jerusalem thirty-three years.
8783	11	2	12	¶Solomon sat on his father David’s throne, and his royal authority was firmly solidified.
8784	11	2	13	¶Haggith’s son Adonijah visited Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. She asked, “Do you come in peace?” He answered, “Yes.”
8785	11	2	14	He added, “I have something to say to you.” She replied, “Speak.”
8786	11	2	15	He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine and all Israel considered me king. But then the kingdom was given to my brother, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> decided it should be his.
8787	11	2	16	Now I’d like to ask you for just one thing. Please don’t refuse me.” She said, “Go ahead and ask.”
8788	11	2	17	He said, “Please ask King Solomon if he would give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife, for he won’t refuse you.”
8789	11	2	18	Bathsheba replied, “That’s fine, I’ll speak to the king on your behalf.”
8790	11	2	19	¶So Bathsheba visited King Solomon to speak to him on Adonijah’s behalf. The king got up to greet her, bowed to her, and then sat on his throne. He ordered a throne to be brought for the king’s mother, and she sat at his right hand.
8791	11	2	20	She said, “I would like to ask you for just one small favor. Please don’t refuse me.” He said, “Go ahead and ask, my mother, for I would not refuse you.”
8792	11	2	21	She said, “Allow Abishag the Shunammite to be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife.”
8793	11	2	22	King Solomon answered his mother, “Why just request Abishag the Shunammite for him? Since he is my older brother, you should also request the kingdom for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab son of Zeruiah!”
8794	11	2	23	¶King Solomon then swore an oath by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “May God judge me severely, if Adonijah does not pay for this request with his life!
8795	11	2	24	Now, as certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives (he who made me secure, allowed me to sit on my father David’s throne, and established a dynasty for me as he promised), Adonijah will be executed today!”
8796	11	2	25	King Solomon then sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he killed Adonijah.
8797	11	2	26	¶The king then told Abiathar the priest, “Go back to your property in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but today I will not kill you because you did carry the ark of the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> before my father David and you suffered with my father through all his difficult times.”
8798	11	2	27	Solomon removed Abiathar from being a priest for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, fulfilling the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message that he had pronounced against the family of Eli in Shiloh.
8799	11	2	28	¶When the news reached Joab (for Joab had supported Adonijah, although he had not supported Absalom), he ran to the tent of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar.
8800	11	2	29	When King Solomon heard that Joab had run to the tent of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and was right there beside the altar, he ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, “Go, strike him down.”
8801	11	2	30	When Benaiah arrived at the tent of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he said to him, “The king says, ‘Come out!’” But he replied, “No, I will die here!” So Benaiah sent word to the king and reported Joab’s reply.
8802	11	2	31	The king told him, “Do as he said! Strike him down and bury him. Take away from me and from my father’s family the guilt of Joab’s murderous, bloody deeds.
8803	11	2	32	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> punish him for the blood he shed; behind my father David’s back he struck down and murdered with the sword two men who were more innocent and morally upright than he – Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army.
8804	11	2	33	May Joab and his descendants be perpetually guilty of their shed blood, but may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> give perpetual peace to David, his descendants, his family, and his dynasty.”
8805	11	2	34	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and executed Joab; he was buried at his home in the wilderness.
8806	11	2	35	The king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada to take his place at the head of the army, and the king appointed Zadok the priest to take Abiathar’s place.
8807	11	2	36	¶Next the king summoned Shimei and told him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there – but you may not leave there to go anywhere!
8808	11	2	37	If you ever do leave and cross the Kidron Valley, know for sure that you will certainly die! You will be responsible for your own death.”
8809	11	2	38	Shimei said to the king, “My master the king’s proposal is acceptable. Your servant will do as you say.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
8810	11	2	39	¶Three years later two of Shimei’s servants ran away to King Achish son of Maacah of Gath. Shimei was told, “Look, your servants are in Gath.”
8811	11	2	40	So Shimei got up, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish at Gath to find his servants; Shimei went and brought back his servants from Gath.
8812	11	2	41	When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had then returned,
8813	11	2	42	the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “You will recall that I made you take an oath by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> and I solemnly warned you, ‘If you ever leave and go anywhere, know for sure that you will certainly die.’ You said to me, ‘The proposal is acceptable; I agree to it.’
8814	11	2	43	Why then have you broken the oath you made before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and disobeyed the order I gave you?”
8815	11	2	44	Then the king said to Shimei, “You are well aware of the way you mistreated my father David. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will punish you for what you did.
8816	11	2	45	But King Solomon will be empowered and David’s dynasty will endure permanently before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
8817	11	2	46	The king then gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada who went and executed Shimei. ¶So Solomon took firm control of the kingdom.
8818	11	3	1	¶Solomon made an alliance by marriage with Pharaoh, king of Egypt; he married Pharaoh’s daughter. He brought her to the City of David until he could finish building his residence and the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and the wall around Jerusalem.
8819	11	3	2	Now the people were offering sacrifices at the high places, because in those days a temple had not yet been built to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
8820	11	3	3	Solomon demonstrated his loyalty to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by following the practices of his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.
8821	11	3	4	¶The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for it had the most prominent of the high places. Solomon would offer up a thousand burnt sacrifices on the altar there.
8822	11	3	5	One night in Gibeon the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon in a dream. God said, “Tell me what I should give you.”
8823	11	3	6	Solomon replied, “You demonstrated great loyalty to your servant, my father David, as he served you faithfully, properly, and sincerely. You have maintained this great loyalty to this day by allowing his son to sit on his throne.
8824	11	3	7	Now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God, you have made your servant king in my father David’s place, even though I am only a young man and am inexperienced.
8825	11	3	8	Your servant stands among your chosen people; they are a great nation that is too numerous to count or number.
8826	11	3	9	So give your servant a discerning mind so he can make judicial decisions for your people and distinguish right from wrong. Otherwise no one is able to make judicial decisions for this great nation of yours.”
8827	11	3	10	The Lord was pleased that Solomon made this request.
8828	11	3	11	God said to him, “Because you asked for the ability to make wise judicial decisions, and not for long life, or riches, or vengeance on your enemies,
8829	11	3	12	I grant your request, and give you a wise and discerning mind superior to that of anyone who has preceded or will succeed you.
8830	11	3	13	Furthermore, I am giving you what you did not request – riches and honor so that you will be the greatest king of your generation.
8831	11	3	14	If you follow my instructions by obeying my rules and regulations, just as your father David did, then I will grant you long life.”
8832	11	3	15	Solomon then woke up and realized it was a dream. He went to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord’s covenant, offered up burnt sacrifices, presented peace offerings, and held a feast for all his servants.
8833	11	3	16	¶Then two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
8834	11	3	17	One of the women said, “My master, this woman and I live in the same house. I had a baby while she was with me in the house.
8835	11	3	18	Then three days after I had my baby, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one else in the house except the two of us.
8836	11	3	19	This woman’s child suffocated during the night when she rolled on top of him.
8837	11	3	20	She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your servant was sleeping. She put him in her arms, and put her dead son in my arms.
8838	11	3	21	I got up in the morning to nurse my son, and there he was, dead! But when I examined him carefully in the morning, I realized it was not my baby.”
8839	11	3	22	The other woman said, “No! My son is alive; your son is dead!” But the first woman replied, “No, your son is dead; my son is alive.” Each presented her case before the king.
8840	11	3	23	¶The king said, “One says, ‘My son is alive; your son is dead,’ while the other says, ‘No, your son is dead; my son is alive.’”
8841	11	3	24	The king ordered, “Get me a sword!” So they placed a sword before the king.
8842	11	3	25	The king then said, “Cut the living child in two, and give half to one and half to the other!”
8843	11	3	26	The real mother spoke up to the king, for her motherly instincts were aroused. She said, “My master, give her the living child! Whatever you do, don’t kill him!” But the other woman said, “Neither one of us will have him! Let them cut him in two!”
8844	11	3	27	The king responded, “Give the first woman the living child; don’t kill him. She is the mother.”
8845	11	3	28	When all Israel heard about the judicial decision which the king had rendered, they respected the king, for they realized that he possessed divine wisdom to make judicial decisions.
8846	11	4	1	¶King Solomon ruled over all Israel.
8847	11	4	2	These were his officials:¶Azariah son of Zadok was the priest.
8848	11	4	3	¶Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, wrote down what happened. ¶Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of the records.
8849	11	4	4	¶Benaiah son of Jehoiada was commander of the army.¶Zadok and Abiathar were priests.
8850	11	4	5	¶Azariah son of Nathan was supervisor of the district governors.¶Zabud son of Nathan was a priest and adviser to the king.
8851	11	4	6	¶Ahishar was supervisor of the palace. ¶Adoniram son of Abda was supervisor of the work crews.
8852	11	4	7	¶Solomon had twelve district governors appointed throughout Israel who acquired supplies for the king and his palace. Each was responsible for one month in the year.
8853	11	4	8	These were their names:¶Ben Hur was in charge of the hill country of Ephraim.
8854	11	4	9	¶Ben Deker was in charge of Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan.
8855	11	4	10	¶Ben Hesed was in charge of Arubboth; he controlled Socoh and all the territory of Hepher.
8856	11	4	11	¶Ben Abinadab was in charge of Naphath Dor. (He was married to Solomon’s daughter Taphath.)
8857	11	4	12	¶Baana son of Ahilud was in charge of Taanach and Megiddo, as well as all of Beth Shean next to Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah and on past Jokmeam.
8858	11	4	13	¶Ben Geber was in charge of Ramoth Gilead; he controlled the villages of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead, as well as the region of Argob in Bashan, including sixty large walled cities with bronze bars locking their gates.
8859	11	4	14	¶Ahinadab son of Iddo was in charge of Mahanaim.
8860	11	4	15	¶Ahimaaz was in charge of Naphtali. (He married Solomon’s daughter Basemath.)
8861	11	4	16	¶Baana son of Hushai was in charge of Asher and Aloth.
8862	11	4	17	¶Jehoshaphat son of Paruah was in charge of Issachar.
8863	11	4	18	¶Shimei son of Ela was in charge of Benjamin.
8864	11	4	19	¶Geber son of Uri was in charge of the land of Gilead (the territory which had once belonged to King Sihon of the Amorites and to King Og of Bashan). He was sole governor of the area.
8865	11	4	20	¶The people of Judah and Israel were as innumerable as the sand on the seashore; they had plenty to eat and drink and were happy.
8866	11	4	21	(5:1) Solomon ruled all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These kingdoms paid tribute as Solomon’s subjects throughout his lifetime.
8867	11	4	22	Each day Solomon’s royal court consumed thirty cors of finely milled flour, sixty cors of cereal,
8868	11	4	23	ten calves fattened in the stall, twenty calves from the pasture, and a hundred sheep, not to mention rams, gazelles, deer, and well-fed birds.
8869	11	4	24	His royal court was so large because he ruled over all the kingdoms west of the Euphrates River from Tiphsah to Gaza; he was at peace with all his neighbors.
8870	11	4	25	All the people of Judah and Israel had security; everyone from Dan to Beer Sheba enjoyed the produce of their vines and fig trees throughout Solomon’s lifetime.
8871	11	4	26	Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his chariot horses and 12,000 horses.
8872	11	4	27	The district governors acquired supplies for King Solomon and all who ate in his royal palace. Each was responsible for one month in the year; they made sure nothing was lacking.
8873	11	4	28	Each one also brought to the assigned location his quota of barley and straw for the various horses.
8874	11	4	29	¶God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment; the breadth of his understanding was as infinite as the sand on the seashore.
8875	11	4	30	Solomon was wiser than all the men of the east and all the sages of Egypt.
8876	11	4	31	He was wiser than any man, including Ethan the Ezrahite or Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. He was famous in all the neighboring nations.
8877	11	4	32	He composed 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs.
8878	11	4	33	He produced manuals on botany, describing every kind of plant, from the cedars of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows on walls. He also produced manuals on biology, describing animals, birds, insects, and fish.
8879	11	4	34	People from all nations came to hear Solomon’s display of wisdom; they came from all the kings of the earth who heard about his wisdom.
8880	11	5	1	¶(5:15) King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to Solomon when he heard that he had been anointed king in his father’s place. (Hiram had always been an ally of David.)
8881	11	5	2	Solomon then sent this message to Hiram:
8882	11	5	3	“You know that my father David was unable to build a temple to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God, for he was busy fighting battles on all fronts while the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> subdued his enemies.
8883	11	5	4	But now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God has made me secure on all fronts; there is no adversary or dangerous threat.
8884	11	5	5	So I have decided to build a temple to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> instructed my father David, ‘Your son, whom I will put on your throne in your place, is the one who will build a temple to honor me.’
8885	11	5	6	So now order some cedars of Lebanon to be cut for me. My servants will work with your servants. I will pay your servants whatever you say is appropriate, for you know that we have no one among us who knows how to cut down trees like the Sidonians.”
8886	11	5	7	¶When Hiram heard Solomon’s message, he was very happy. He said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is worthy of praise today because he has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation.”
8887	11	5	8	Hiram then sent this message to Solomon: “I received the message you sent to me. I will give you all the cedars and evergreens you need.
8888	11	5	9	My servants will bring the timber down from Lebanon to the sea. I will send it by sea in raft-like bundles to the place you designate. There I will separate the logs and you can carry them away. In exchange you will supply the food I need for my royal court.”
8889	11	5	10	¶So Hiram supplied the cedars and evergreens Solomon needed,
8890	11	5	11	and Solomon supplied Hiram annually with 20,000 cors of wheat as provision for his royal court, as well as 120,000 gallons of pure olive oil.
8891	11	5	12	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave Solomon wisdom, as he had promised him. And Hiram and Solomon were at peace and made a treaty.
8892	11	5	13	¶King Solomon conscripted work crews from throughout Israel, 30,000 men in all.
8893	11	5	14	He sent them to Lebanon in shifts of 10,000 men per month. They worked in Lebanon for one month, and then spent two months at home. Adoniram was supervisor of the work crews.
8894	11	5	15	Solomon also had 70,000 common laborers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hills,
8895	11	5	16	besides 3,300 officials who supervised the workers.
8896	11	5	17	By royal order they supplied large valuable stones in order to build the temple’s foundation with chiseled stone.
8897	11	5	18	Solomon’s and Hiram’s construction workers, along with men from Byblos, did the chiseling and prepared the wood and stones for the building of the temple.
8898	11	6	1	¶In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites left Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, during the month Ziv (the second month), he began building the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
8899	11	6	2	The temple King Solomon built for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
8900	11	6	3	The porch in front of the main hall of the temple was 30 feet long, corresponding to the width of the temple. It was 15 feet wide, extending out from the front of the temple.
8901	11	6	4	He made framed windows for the temple.
8902	11	6	5	He built an extension all around the walls of the temple’s main hall and holy place and constructed side rooms in it.
8903	11	6	6	The bottom floor of the extension was seven and a half feet wide, the middle floor nine feet wide, and the third floor ten and a half feet wide. He made ledges on the temple’s outer walls so the beams would not have to be inserted into the walls.
8904	11	6	7	As the temple was being built, only stones shaped at the quarry were used; the sound of hammers, pickaxes, or any other iron tool was not heard at the temple while it was being built.
8905	11	6	8	The entrance to the bottom level of side rooms was on the south side of the temple; stairs went up to the middle floor and then on up to the third floor.
8906	11	6	9	He finished building the temple and covered it with rafters and boards made of cedar.
8907	11	6	10	He built an extension all around the temple; it was seven and a half feet high and it was attached to the temple by cedar beams.
8908	11	6	11	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Solomon:
8909	11	6	12	“As for this temple you are building, if you follow my rules, observe my regulations, and obey all my commandments, I will fulfill through you the promise I made to your father David.
8910	11	6	13	I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel.”
8911	11	6	14	¶So Solomon finished building the temple.
8912	11	6	15	He constructed the walls inside the temple with cedar planks; he paneled the inside with wood from the floor of the temple to the rafters of the ceiling. He covered the temple floor with boards made from the wood of evergreens.
8913	11	6	16	He built a wall 30 feet in from the rear of the temple as a partition for an inner sanctuary that would be the most holy place. He paneled the wall with cedar planks from the floor to the rafters.
8914	11	6	17	The main hall in front of the inner sanctuary was 60 feet long.
8915	11	6	18	The inside of the temple was all cedar and was adorned with carvings of round ornaments and of flowers in bloom. Everything was cedar; no stones were visible.
8916	11	6	19	¶He prepared the inner sanctuary inside the temple so that the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> could be placed there.
8917	11	6	20	The inner sanctuary was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high. He plated it with gold, as well as the cedar altar.
8918	11	6	21	Solomon plated the inside of the temple with gold. He hung golden chains in front of the inner sanctuary and plated the inner sanctuary with gold.
8919	11	6	22	He plated the entire inside of the temple with gold, as well as the altar inside the inner sanctuary.
8920	11	6	23	¶In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood; each stood 15 feet high.
8921	11	6	24	Each of the first cherub’s wings was seven and a half feet long; its entire wingspan was 15 feet.
8922	11	6	25	The second cherub also had a wingspan of 15 feet; it was identical to the first in measurements and shape.
8923	11	6	26	Each cherub stood 15 feet high.
8924	11	6	27	He put the cherubim in the inner sanctuary of the temple. Their wings were spread out. One of the first cherub’s wings touched one wall and one of the other cherub’s wings touched the opposite wall. The first cherub’s other wing touched the second cherub’s other wing in the middle of the room.
8925	11	6	28	He plated the cherubim with gold.
8926	11	6	29	¶On all the walls around the temple, inside and out, he carved cherubim, palm trees, and flowers in bloom.
8927	11	6	30	He plated the floor of the temple with gold, inside and out.
8928	11	6	31	He made doors of olive wood at the entrance to the inner sanctuary; the pillar on each doorpost was five-sided.
8929	11	6	32	On the two doors made of olive wood he carved cherubim, palm trees, and flowers in bloom, and he plated them with gold. He plated the cherubim and the palm trees with hammered gold.
8930	11	6	33	In the same way he made doorposts of olive wood for the entrance to the main hall, only with four-sided pillars.
8931	11	6	34	He also made two doors out of wood from evergreens; each door had two folding leaves.
8932	11	6	35	He carved cherubim, palm trees, and flowers in bloom and plated them with gold, leveled out over the carvings.
8933	11	6	36	He built the inner courtyard with three rows of chiseled stones and a row of cedar beams.
8934	11	6	37	¶In the month Ziv of the fourth year of Solomon’s reign the foundation was laid for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
8935	11	6	38	In the eleventh year, in the month Bul (the eighth month) the temple was completed in accordance with all its specifications and blueprints. It took seven years to build.
8936	11	7	1	¶Solomon took thirteen years to build his palace.
8937	11	7	2	He named it “The Palace of the Lebanon Forest”; it was 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. It had four rows of cedar pillars and cedar beams above the pillars.
8938	11	7	3	The roof above the beams supported by the pillars was also made of cedar; there were forty-five beams, fifteen per row.
8939	11	7	4	There were three rows of windows arranged in sets of three.
8940	11	7	5	All of the entrances were rectangular in shape and they were arranged in sets of three.
8941	11	7	6	He made a colonnade 75 feet long and 45 feet wide. There was a porch in front of this and pillars and a roof in front of the porch.
8942	11	7	7	He also made a throne room, called “The Hall of Judgment,” where he made judicial decisions. It was paneled with cedar from the floor to the rafters.
8943	11	7	8	The palace where he lived was constructed in a similar way. He also constructed a palace like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.
8944	11	7	9	All of these were built with the best stones, chiseled to the right size and cut with a saw on all sides, from the foundation to the edge of the roof and from the outside to the great courtyard.
8945	11	7	10	The foundation was made of large valuable stones, measuring either 15 feet or 12 feet.
8946	11	7	11	Above the foundation the best stones, chiseled to the right size, were used along with cedar.
8947	11	7	12	Around the great courtyard were three rows of chiseled stones and one row of cedar beams, like the inner courtyard of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and the hall of the palace.
8948	11	7	13	¶King Solomon sent for Hiram of Tyre.
8949	11	7	14	He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a craftsman in bronze from Tyre. He had the skill and knowledge to make all kinds of works of bronze. He reported to King Solomon and did all the work he was assigned.
8950	11	7	15	¶He fashioned two bronze pillars; each pillar was 27 feet high and 18 feet in circumference.
8951	11	7	16	He made two bronze tops for the pillars; each was seven-and-a-half feet high.
8952	11	7	17	The latticework on the tops of the pillars was adorned with ornamental wreaths and chains; the top of each pillar had seven groupings of ornaments.
8953	11	7	18	When he made the pillars, there were two rows of pomegranate-shaped ornaments around the latticework covering the top of each pillar.
8954	11	7	19	The tops of the two pillars in the porch were shaped like lilies and were six feet high.
8955	11	7	20	On the top of each pillar, right above the bulge beside the latticework, there were two hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments arranged in rows all the way around.
8956	11	7	21	He set up the pillars on the porch in front of the main hall. He erected one pillar on the right side and called it Yakin; he erected the other pillar on the left side and called it Boaz.
8957	11	7	22	The tops of the pillars were shaped like lilies. So the construction of the pillars was completed.
8958	11	7	23	¶He also made the large bronze basin called “The Sea.” It measured 15 feet from rim to rim, was circular in shape, and stood seven-and-a-half feet high. Its circumference was 45 feet.
8959	11	7	24	Under the rim all the way around it were round ornaments arranged in settings 15 feet long. The ornaments were in two rows and had been cast with “The Sea.”
8960	11	7	25	“The Sea” stood on top of twelve bulls. Three faced northward, three westward, three southward, and three eastward. “The Sea” was placed on top of them, and they all faced outward.
8961	11	7	26	It was four fingers thick and its rim was like that of a cup shaped like a lily blossom. It could hold about 12,000 gallons.
8962	11	7	27	¶He also made ten bronze movable stands. Each stand was six feet long, six feet wide, and four-and-a-half feet high.
8963	11	7	28	The stands were constructed with frames between the joints.
8964	11	7	29	On these frames and joints were ornamental lions, bulls, and cherubim. Under the lions and bulls were decorative wreaths.
8965	11	7	30	Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles and four supports. Under the basin the supports were fashioned on each side with wreaths.
8966	11	7	31	Inside the stand was a round opening that was a foot-and-a-half deep; it had a support that was two and one-quarter feet long. On the edge of the opening were carvings in square frames.
8967	11	7	32	The four wheels were under the frames and the crossbars of the axles were connected to the stand. Each wheel was two and one-quarter feet high.
8968	11	7	33	The wheels were constructed like chariot wheels; their crossbars, rims, spokes, and hubs were made of cast metal.
8969	11	7	34	Each stand had four supports, one per side projecting out from the stand.
8970	11	7	35	On top of each stand was a round opening three-quarters of a foot deep; there were also supports and frames on top of the stands.
8971	11	7	36	He engraved ornamental cherubim, lions, and palm trees on the plates of the supports and frames wherever there was room, with wreaths all around.
8972	11	7	37	He made the ten stands in this way. All of them were cast in one mold and were identical in measurements and shape.
8973	11	7	38	¶He also made ten bronze basins, each of which could hold about 240 gallons. Each basin was six feet in diameter; there was one basin for each stand.
8974	11	7	39	He put five basins on the south side of the temple and five on the north side. He put “The Sea” on the south side, in the southeast corner.
8975	11	7	40	¶Hiram also made basins, shovels, and bowls. He finished all the work on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple he had been assigned by King Solomon.
8976	11	7	41	He made the two pillars, the two bowl-shaped tops of the pillars, the latticework for the bowl-shaped tops of the two pillars,
8977	11	7	42	the four hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments for the latticework of the two pillars (each latticework had two rows of these ornaments at the bowl-shaped top of the pillar),
8978	11	7	43	the ten movable stands with their ten basins,
8979	11	7	44	the big bronze basin called “The Sea” with its twelve bulls underneath,
8980	11	7	45	and the pots, shovels, and bowls. All these items King Solomon assigned Hiram to make for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple were made from polished bronze.
8981	11	7	46	The king had them cast in earth foundries in the region of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.
8982	11	7	47	Solomon left all these items unweighed; there were so many of them they did not weigh the bronze.
8983	11	7	48	¶Solomon also made all these items for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple: the gold altar, the gold table on which was kept the Bread of the Presence,
8984	11	7	49	the pure gold lampstands at the entrance to the inner sanctuary (five on the right and five on the left), the gold flower-shaped ornaments, lamps, and tongs,
8985	11	7	50	the pure gold bowls, trimming shears, basins, pans, and censers, and the gold door sockets for the inner sanctuary (the most holy place) and for the doors of the main hall of the temple.
8986	11	7	51	When King Solomon finished constructing the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, he put the holy items that belonged to his father David (the silver, gold, and other articles) in the treasuries of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
8987	11	8	1	¶Then Solomon convened in Jerusalem Israel’s elders, all the leaders of the Israelite tribes and families, so they could witness the transferal of the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant from the City of David (that is, Zion).
8988	11	8	2	All the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon during the festival in the month Ethanim (the seventh month).
8989	11	8	3	When all Israel’s elders had arrived, the priests lifted the ark.
8990	11	8	4	The priests and Levites carried the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the tent of meeting, and all the holy items in the tent.
8991	11	8	5	Now King Solomon and all the Israelites who had assembled with him went on ahead of the ark and sacrificed more sheep and cattle than could be counted or numbered.
8992	11	8	6	¶The priests brought the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant to its assigned place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, in the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim.
8993	11	8	7	The cherubim’s wings extended over the place where the ark sat; the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles.
8994	11	8	8	The poles were so long their ends were visible from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from beyond that point. They have remained there to this very day.
8995	11	8	9	There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets Moses had placed there in Horeb. It was there that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made a covenant with the Israelites after he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
8996	11	8	10	Once the priests left the holy place, a cloud filled the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
8997	11	8	11	The priests could not carry out their duties because of the cloud; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s glory filled his temple.
8998	11	8	12	¶Then Solomon said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said that he lives in thick darkness.
8999	11	8	13	O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, truly I have built a lofty temple for you, a place where you can live permanently.”
9000	11	8	14	Then the king turned around and pronounced a blessing over the whole Israelite assembly as they stood there.
9001	11	8	15	He said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel is worthy of praise because he has fulfilled what he promised my father David.
9002	11	8	16	He told David, ‘Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a temple in which to live. But I have chosen David to lead my people Israel.’
9003	11	8	17	Now my father David had a strong desire to build a temple to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
9004	11	8	18	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told my father David, ‘It is right for you to have a strong desire to build a temple to honor me.
9005	11	8	19	But you will not build the temple; your very own son will build the temple for my honor.’
9006	11	8	20	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has kept the promise he made. I have taken my father David’s place and have occupied the throne of Israel, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised. I have built this temple for the honor of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel
9007	11	8	21	and set up in it a place for the ark containing the covenant the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made with our ancestors when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.”
9008	11	8	22	¶Solomon stood before the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in front of the entire assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward the sky.
9009	11	8	23	He prayed: “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven above or on earth below! You maintain covenantal loyalty to your servants who obey you with sincerity.
9010	11	8	24	You have kept your word to your servant, my father David; this very day you have fulfilled what you promised.
9011	11	8	25	Now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> God of Israel, keep the promise you made to your servant, my father David, when you said, ‘You will never fail to have a successor ruling before me on the throne of Israel, provided that your descendants watch their step and serve me as you have done.’
9012	11	8	26	Now, O God of Israel, may the promise you made to your servant, my father David, be realized.
9013	11	8	27	¶“God does not really live on the earth! Look, if the sky and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this temple I have built!
9014	11	8	28	But respond favorably to your servant’s prayer and his request for help, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God. Answer the desperate prayer your servant is presenting to you today.
9015	11	8	29	Night and day may you watch over this temple, the place where you promised you would live. May you answer your servant’s prayer for this place.
9016	11	8	30	Respond to the request of your servant and your people Israel for this place. Hear from inside your heavenly dwelling place and respond favorably.
9017	11	8	31	¶“When someone is accused of sinning against his neighbor and the latter pronounces a curse on the alleged offender before your altar in this temple, be willing to forgive the accused if the accusation is false.
9018	11	8	32	Listen from heaven and make a just decision about your servants’ claims. Condemn the guilty party, declare the other innocent, and give both of them what they deserve.
9019	11	8	33	¶“The time will come when your people Israel are defeated by an enemy because they sinned against you. If they come back to you, renew their allegiance to you, and pray for your help in this temple,
9020	11	8	34	then listen from heaven, forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them back to the land you gave to their ancestors.
9021	11	8	35	¶“The time will come when the skies are shut up tightly and no rain falls because your people sinned against you. When they direct their prayers toward this place, renew their allegiance to you, and turn away from their sin because you punish them,
9022	11	8	36	then listen from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Certainly you will then teach them the right way to live and send rain on your land that you have given your people to possess.
9023	11	8	37	¶“The time will come when the land suffers from a famine, a plague, blight and disease, or a locust invasion, or when their enemy lays siege to the cities of the land, or when some other type of plague or epidemic occurs.
9024	11	8	38	When all your people Israel pray and ask for help, as they acknowledge their pain and spread out their hands toward this temple,
9025	11	8	39	then listen from your heavenly dwelling place, forgive their sin, and act favorably toward each one based on your evaluation of his motives. (Indeed you are the only one who can correctly evaluate the motives of all people.)
9026	11	8	40	Then they will obey you throughout their lifetimes as they live on the land you gave to our ancestors.
9027	11	8	41	¶“Foreigners, who do not belong to your people Israel, will come from a distant land because of your reputation.
9028	11	8	42	When they hear about your great reputation and your ability to accomplish mighty deeds, they will come and direct their prayers toward this temple.
9029	11	8	43	Then listen from your heavenly dwelling place and answer all the prayers of the foreigners. Then all the nations of the earth will acknowledge your reputation, obey you like your people Israel do, and recognize that this temple I built belongs to you.
9030	11	8	44	¶“When you direct your people to march out and fight their enemies, and they direct their prayers to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> toward his chosen city and this temple I built for your honor,
9031	11	8	45	then listen from heaven to their prayers for help and vindicate them.
9032	11	8	46	¶“The time will come when your people will sin against you (for there is no one who is sinless!) and you will be angry with them and deliver them over to their enemies, who will take them as prisoners to their own land, whether far away or close by.
9033	11	8	47	When your people come to their senses in the land where they are held prisoner, they will repent and beg for your mercy in the land of their imprisonment, admitting, ‘We have sinned and gone astray; we have done evil.’
9034	11	8	48	When they return to you with all their heart and being in the land where they are held prisoner, and direct their prayers to you toward the land you gave to their ancestors, your chosen city, and the temple I built for your honor,
9035	11	8	49	then listen from your heavenly dwelling place to their prayers for help and vindicate them.
9036	11	8	50	Forgive all the rebellious acts of your sinful people and cause their captors to have mercy on them.
9037	11	8	51	After all, they are your people and your special possession whom you brought out of Egypt, from the middle of the iron-smelting furnace.
9038	11	8	52	¶“May you be attentive to your servant’s and your people Israel’s requests for help and may you respond to all their prayers to you.
9039	11	8	53	After all, you picked them out of all the nations of the earth to be your special possession, just as you, O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, announced through your servant Moses when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt.”
9040	11	8	54	¶When Solomon finished presenting all these prayers and requests to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he got up from before the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> where he had kneeled and spread out his hands toward the sky.
9041	11	8	55	When he stood up, he pronounced a blessing over the entire assembly of Israel, saying in a loud voice:
9042	11	8	56	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is worthy of praise because he has made Israel his people secure just as he promised! Not one of all the faithful promises he made through his servant Moses is left unfulfilled!
9043	11	8	57	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God be with us, as he was with our ancestors. May he not abandon us or leave us.
9044	11	8	58	May he make us submissive, so we can follow all his instructions and obey the commandments, rules, and regulations he commanded our ancestors.
9045	11	8	59	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God be constantly aware of these requests of mine I have presented to him, so that he might vindicate his servant and his people Israel as the need arises.
9046	11	8	60	Then all the nations of the earth will recognize that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the only genuine God.
9047	11	8	61	May you demonstrate wholehearted devotion to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God by following his rules and obeying his commandments, as you are presently doing.”
9048	11	8	62	¶The king and all Israel with him were presenting sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
9049	11	8	63	Solomon offered as peace offerings to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. Then the king and all the Israelites dedicated the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
9050	11	8	64	That day the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard that is in front of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. He offered there burnt sacrifices, grain offerings, and the fat from the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that stood before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was too small to hold all these offerings.
9051	11	8	65	At that time Solomon and all Israel with him celebrated a festival before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God for two entire weeks. This great assembly included people from all over the land, from Lebo Hamath in the north to the Stream of Egypt in the south.
9052	11	8	66	On the fifteenth day after the festival started, he dismissed the people. They asked God to empower the king and then went to their homes, happy and content because of all the good the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had done for his servant David and his people Israel.
9053	11	9	1	¶After Solomon finished building the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, the royal palace, and all the other construction projects he had planned,
9054	11	9	2	the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon a second time, in the same way he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
9055	11	9	3	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “I have answered your prayer and your request for help that you made to me. I have consecrated this temple you built by making it my permanent home; I will be constantly present there.
9056	11	9	4	You must serve me with integrity and sincerity, just as your father David did. Do everything I commanded and obey my rules and regulations.
9057	11	9	5	Then I will allow your dynasty to rule over Israel permanently, just as I promised your father David, ‘You will not fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’
9058	11	9	6	¶“But if you or your sons ever turn away from me, fail to obey the regulations and rules I instructed you to keep, and decide to serve and worship other gods,
9059	11	9	7	then I will remove Israel from the land I have given them, I will abandon this temple I have consecrated with my presence, and Israel will be mocked and ridiculed among all the nations.
9060	11	9	8	This temple will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by it will be shocked and will hiss out their scorn, saying, ‘Why did the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> do this to this land and this temple?’
9061	11	9	9	Others will then answer, ‘Because they abandoned the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God, who led their ancestors out of Egypt. They embraced other gods whom they worshiped and served. That is why the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has brought all this disaster down on them.’”
9062	11	9	10	¶After twenty years, during which Solomon built the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and the royal palace,
9063	11	9	11	King Solomon gave King Hiram of Tyre twenty cities in the region of Galilee, because Hiram had supplied Solomon with cedars, evergreens, and all the gold he wanted.
9064	11	9	12	When Hiram went out from Tyre to inspect the cities Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.
9065	11	9	13	Hiram asked, “Why did you give me these cities, my friend ?” He called that area the region of Cabul, a name which it has retained to this day.
9066	11	9	14	Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
9067	11	9	15	¶Here are the details concerning the work crews King Solomon conscripted to build the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, his palace, the terrace, the wall of Jerusalem, and the cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
9068	11	9	16	(Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had attacked and captured Gezer. He burned it and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city. He gave it as a wedding present to his daughter, who had married Solomon.)
9069	11	9	17	Solomon built up Gezer, lower Beth Horon,
9070	11	9	18	Baalath, Tadmor in the wilderness,
9071	11	9	19	all the storage cities that belonged to him, and the cities where chariots and horses were kept. He built whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout his entire kingdom.
9072	11	9	20	Now several non-Israelite peoples were left in the land after the conquest of Joshua, including the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
9073	11	9	21	Their descendants remained in the land (the Israelites were unable to wipe them out completely). Solomon conscripted them for his work crews, and they continue in that role to this very day.
9074	11	9	22	Solomon did not assign Israelites to these work crews; the Israelites served as his soldiers, attendants, officers, charioteers, and commanders of his chariot forces.
9075	11	9	23	These men were also in charge of Solomon’s work projects; there were a total of 550 men who supervised the workers.
9076	11	9	24	Solomon built the terrace as soon as Pharaoh’s daughter moved up from the City of David to the palace Solomon built for her.
9077	11	9	25	¶Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had built for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, burning incense along with them before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He made the temple his official worship place.
9078	11	9	26	¶King Solomon also built ships in Ezion Geber, which is located near Elat in the land of Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.
9079	11	9	27	Hiram sent his fleet and some of his sailors, who were well acquainted with the sea, to serve with Solomon’s men.
9080	11	9	28	They sailed to Ophir, took from there 420 talents of gold, and then brought them to King Solomon.
9081	11	10	1	¶When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon, she came to challenge him with difficult questions.
9082	11	10	2	She arrived in Jerusalem with a great display of pomp, bringing with her camels carrying spices, a very large quantity of gold, and precious gems. She visited Solomon and discussed with him everything that was on her mind.
9083	11	10	3	Solomon answered all her questions; there was no question too complex for the king.
9084	11	10	4	When the queen of Sheba saw for herself Solomon’s extensive wisdom, the palace he had built,
9085	11	10	5	the food in his banquet hall, his servants and attendants, their robes, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings which he presented in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, she was amazed.
9086	11	10	6	She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your wise sayings and insight was true!
9087	11	10	7	I did not believe these things until I came and saw them with my own eyes. Indeed, I didn’t hear even half the story! Your wisdom and wealth surpass what was reported to me.
9088	11	10	8	Your attendants, who stand before you at all times and hear your wise sayings, are truly happy!
9089	11	10	9	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God be praised because he favored you by placing you on the throne of Israel! Because of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s eternal love for Israel, he made you king so you could make just and right decisions.”
9090	11	10	10	She gave the king 120 talents of gold, a very large quantity of spices, and precious gems. The quantity of spices the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon has never been matched.
9091	11	10	11	(Hiram’s fleet, which carried gold from Ophir, also brought from Ophir a very large quantity of fine timber and precious gems.
9092	11	10	12	With the timber the king made supports for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and for the royal palace and stringed instruments for the musicians. No one has seen so much of this fine timber to this very day.)
9093	11	10	13	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she requested, besides what he had freely offered her. Then she left and returned to her homeland with her attendants.
9094	11	10	14	¶Solomon received 666 talents of gold per year,
9095	11	10	15	besides what he collected from the merchants, traders, Arabian kings, and governors of the land.
9096	11	10	16	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; 600 measures of gold were used for each shield.
9097	11	10	17	He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold were used for each of these shields. The king placed them in the Palace of the Lebanon Forest.
9098	11	10	18	¶The king made a large throne decorated with ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
9099	11	10	19	There were six steps leading up to the throne, and the back of it was rounded on top. The throne had two armrests with a statue of a lion standing on each side.
9100	11	10	20	There were twelve statues of lions on the six steps, one lion at each end of each step. There was nothing like it in any other kingdom.
9101	11	10	21	¶All of King Solomon’s cups were made of gold, and all the household items in the Palace of the Lebanon Forest were made of pure gold. There were no silver items, for silver was not considered very valuable in Solomon’s time.
9102	11	10	22	Along with Hiram’s fleet, the king had a fleet of large merchant ships that sailed the sea. Once every three years the fleet came into port with cargoes of gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
9103	11	10	23	¶King Solomon was wealthier and wiser than any of the kings of the earth.
9104	11	10	24	Everyone in the world wanted to visit Solomon to see him display his God-given wisdom.
9105	11	10	25	Year after year visitors brought their gifts, which included items of silver, items of gold, clothes, perfume, spices, horses, and mules.
9106	11	10	26	¶Solomon accumulated chariots and horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. He kept them in assigned cities and in Jerusalem.
9107	11	10	27	The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones; cedar was as plentiful as sycamore fig trees are in the foothills.
9108	11	10	28	Solomon acquired his horses from Egypt and from Que; the king’s traders purchased them from Que.
9109	11	10	29	They paid 600 silver pieces for each chariot from Egypt and 150 silver pieces for each horse. They also sold chariots and horses to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Syria.
9110	11	11	1	¶King Solomon fell in love with many foreign women (besides Pharaoh’s daughter), including Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites.
9111	11	11	2	They came from nations about which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had warned the Israelites, “You must not establish friendly relations with them! If you do, they will surely shift your allegiance to their gods.” But Solomon was irresistibly attracted to them.
9112	11	11	3	¶He had 700 royal wives and 300 concubines; his wives had a powerful influence over him.
9113	11	11	4	When Solomon became old, his wives shifted his allegiance to other gods; he was not wholeheartedly devoted to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God, as his father David had been.
9114	11	11	5	Solomon worshiped the Sidonian goddess Astarte and the detestable Ammonite god Milcom.
9115	11	11	6	Solomon did evil in the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span>’s sight; he did not remain loyal to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, like his father David had.
9116	11	11	7	Furthermore, on the hill east of Jerusalem Solomon built a high place for the detestable Moabite god Chemosh and for the detestable Ammonite god Milcom.
9117	11	11	8	He built high places for all his foreign wives so they could burn incense and make sacrifices to their gods.
9118	11	11	9	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was angry with Solomon because he had shifted his allegiance away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him on two occasions
9119	11	11	10	and had warned him about this very thing, so that he would not follow other gods. But he did not obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s command.
9120	11	11	11	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Solomon, “Because you insist on doing these things and have not kept the covenantal rules I gave you, I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant.
9121	11	11	12	However, for your father David’s sake I will not do this while you are alive. I will tear it away from your son’s hand instead.
9122	11	11	13	But I will not tear away the entire kingdom; I will leave your son one tribe for my servant David’s sake and for the sake of my chosen city Jerusalem.”
9123	11	11	14	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought against Solomon an enemy, Hadad the Edomite, a descendant of the Edomite king.
9124	11	11	15	During David’s campaign against Edom, Joab, the commander of the army, while on a mission to bury the dead, killed every male in Edom.
9125	11	11	16	For Joab and the entire Israelite army stayed there six months until they had exterminated every male in Edom.
9126	11	11	17	Hadad, who was only a small boy at the time, escaped with some of his father’s Edomite servants and headed for Egypt.
9127	11	11	18	They went from Midian to Paran; they took some men from Paran and went to Egypt. Pharaoh, king of Egypt, gave him a house and some land and supplied him with food.
9128	11	11	19	Pharaoh liked Hadad so well he gave him his sister-in-law (Queen Tahpenes’ sister) as a wife.
9129	11	11	20	Tahpenes’ sister gave birth to his son, named Genubath. Tahpenes raised him in Pharaoh’s palace; Genubath grew up in Pharaoh’s palace among Pharaoh’s sons.
9130	11	11	21	While in Egypt Hadad heard that David had passed away and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead. So Hadad asked Pharaoh, “Give me permission to leave so I can return to my homeland.”
9131	11	11	22	Pharaoh said to him, “What do you lack here that makes you want to go to your homeland?” Hadad replied, “Nothing, but please give me permission to leave.”
9132	11	11	23	¶God also brought against Solomon another enemy, Rezon son of Eliada who had run away from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah.
9133	11	11	24	He gathered some men and organized a raiding band. When David tried to kill them, they went to Damascus, where they settled down and gained control of the city.
9134	11	11	25	He was Israel’s enemy throughout Solomon’s reign and, like Hadad, caused trouble. He loathed Israel and ruled over Syria.
9135	11	11	26	¶Jeroboam son of Nebat, one of Solomon’s servants, rebelled against the king. He was an Ephraimite from Zeredah whose mother was a widow named Zeruah.
9136	11	11	27	This is what prompted him to rebel against the king: Solomon built a terrace and he closed up a gap in the wall of the city of his father David.
9137	11	11	28	Jeroboam was a talented man; when Solomon saw that the young man was an accomplished worker, he made him the leader of the work crew from the tribe of Joseph.
9138	11	11	29	At that time, when Jeroboam had left Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road; the two of them were alone in the open country. Ahijah was wearing a brand new robe,
9139	11	11	30	and he grabbed the robe and tore it into twelve pieces.
9140	11	11	31	Then he told Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces, for this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said: ‘Look, I am about to tear the kingdom from Solomon’s hand and I will give ten tribes to you.
9141	11	11	32	He will retain one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
9142	11	11	33	I am taking the kingdom from him because they have abandoned me and worshiped the Sidonian goddess Astarte, the Moabite god Chemosh, and the Ammonite god Milcom. They have not followed my instructions by doing what I approve and obeying my rules and regulations, like Solomon’s father David did.
9143	11	11	34	I will not take the whole kingdom from his hand. I will allow him to be ruler for the rest of his life for the sake of my chosen servant David who kept my commandments and rules.
9144	11	11	35	I will take the kingdom from the hand of his son and give ten tribes to you.
9145	11	11	36	I will leave his son one tribe so my servant David’s dynasty may continue to serve me in Jerusalem, the city I have chosen as my home.
9146	11	11	37	I will select you; you will rule over all you desire to have and you will be king over Israel.
9147	11	11	38	You must obey all I command you to do, follow my instructions, do what I approve, and keep my rules and commandments, like my servant David did. Then I will be with you and establish for you a lasting dynasty, as I did for David; I will give you Israel.
9148	11	11	39	I will humiliate David’s descendants because of this, but not forever.”
9149	11	11	40	Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam escaped to Egypt and found refuge with King Shishak of Egypt. He stayed in Egypt until Solomon died.
9150	11	11	41	¶The rest of the events of Solomon’s reign, including all his accomplishments and his wise decisions, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of Solomon.
9151	11	11	42	Solomon ruled over all Israel from Jerusalem for forty years.
9152	11	11	43	Then Solomon passed away and was buried in the city of his father David. His son Rehoboam replaced him as king.
9153	11	12	1	¶Rehoboam traveled to Shechem, for all Israel had gathered in Shechem to make Rehoboam king.
9154	11	12	2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard the news, he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon and had been living ever since.
9155	11	12	3	They sent for him, and Jeroboam and the whole Israelite assembly came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
9156	11	12	4	“Your father made us work too hard. Now if you lighten the demands he made and don’t make us work as hard, we will serve you.”
9157	11	12	5	He said to them, “Go away for three days, then return to me.” So the people went away.
9158	11	12	6	¶King Rehoboam consulted with the older advisers who had served his father Solomon when he had been alive. He asked them, “How do you advise me to answer these people?”
9159	11	12	7	They said to him, “Today if you will be a servant to these people and grant their request, speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants from this time forward.”
9160	11	12	8	But Rehoboam rejected their advice and consulted the young advisers who served him, with whom he had grown up.
9161	11	12	9	He asked them, “How do you advise me to respond to these people who said to me, ‘Lessen the demands your father placed on us’?”
9162	11	12	10	The young advisers with whom Rehoboam had grown up said to him, “Say this to these people who have said to you, ‘Your father made us work hard, but now lighten our burden.’ Say this to them: ‘I am a lot harsher than my father!
9163	11	12	11	My father imposed heavy demands on you; I will make them even heavier. My father punished you with ordinary whips; I will punish you with whips that really sting your flesh.’”
9164	11	12	12	¶Jeroboam and all the people reported to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had ordered when he said, “Return to me on the third day.”
9165	11	12	13	The king responded to the people harshly. He rejected the advice of the older men
9166	11	12	14	and followed the advice of the younger ones. He said, “My father imposed heavy demands on you; I will make them even heavier. My father punished you with ordinary whips; I will punish you with whips that really sting your flesh.”
9167	11	12	15	The king refused to listen to the people, because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was instigating this turn of events so that he might bring to pass the prophetic announcement he had made through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
9168	11	12	16	¶When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king, “We have no portion in David, no share in the son of Jesse! Return to your homes, O Israel! Now, look after your own dynasty, O David!” So Israel returned to their homes.
9169	11	12	17	(Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.)
9170	11	12	18	King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, the supervisor of the work crews, out after them, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to jump into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
9171	11	12	19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the Davidic dynasty to this very day.
9172	11	12	20	When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. No one except the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the Davidic dynasty.
9173	11	12	21	¶When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he summoned 180,000 skilled warriors from all of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin to attack Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
9174	11	12	22	But God told Shemaiah the prophet,
9175	11	12	23	“Say this to King Rehoboam son of Solomon of Judah, and to all Judah and Benjamin, as well as the rest of the people,
9176	11	12	24	‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: “Do not attack and make war with your brothers, the Israelites. Each of you go home. Indeed this thing has happened because of me.”’” So they obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message. They went home in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message.
9177	11	12	25	¶Jeroboam built up Shechem in the Ephraimite hill country and lived there. From there he went out and built up Penuel.
9178	11	12	26	Jeroboam then thought to himself: “Now the Davidic dynasty could regain the kingdom.
9179	11	12	27	If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple in Jerusalem, their loyalty could shift to their former master, King Rehoboam of Judah. They might kill me and return to King Rehoboam of Judah.”
9180	11	12	28	After the king had consulted with his advisers, he made two golden calves. Then he said to the people, “It is too much trouble for you to go up to Jerusalem. Look, Israel, here are your gods who brought you up from the land of Egypt.”
9181	11	12	29	He put one in Bethel and the other in Dan.
9182	11	12	30	This caused Israel to sin; the people went to Bethel and Dan to worship the calves.
9183	11	12	31	¶He built temples on the high places and appointed as priests common people who were not Levites.
9184	11	12	32	Jeroboam inaugurated a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival celebrated in Judah. On the altar in Bethel he offered sacrifices to the calves he had made. In Bethel he also appointed priests for the high places he had made.
9185	11	12	33	¶On the fifteenth day of the eighth month (a date he had arbitrarily chosen) Jeroboam offered sacrifices on the altar he had made in Bethel. He inaugurated a festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to offer sacrifices.
9186	11	13	1	Just then a prophet arrived from Judah with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message for Bethel, as Jeroboam was standing near the altar ready to offer a sacrifice.
9187	11	13	2	He cried out against the altar with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s</span> message, “O altar, altar! This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘Look, a son named Josiah will be born to the Davidic dynasty. He will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who offer sacrifices on you. Human bones will be burned on you.’”
9188	11	13	3	That day he had also given a sign, saying, “This is the sign that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has declared: The altar will split open and the ashes on it will pour out.”
9189	11	13	4	When the king heard the prophet’s message that he had cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam took his hand from the altar and pointed it saying, “Seize him!” Then the hand that he had pointed at him stiffened up and he could not pull it back.
9190	11	13	5	Meanwhile the altar split open and the ashes poured from the altar in fulfillment of the sign the prophet had given with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message.
9191	11	13	6	The king responded to the prophet, “Seek the favor of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and pray for me, so that my hand may be restored.” So the prophet sought the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s favor and the king’s hand was restored as it was at first.
9192	11	13	7	The king then said to the prophet, “Come home with me and have something to eat, so that I may give you a gift.”
9193	11	13	8	But the prophet said to the king, “Even if you were to give me half your possessions, I would not go with you. I am not allowed to eat food or drink water in this place.
9194	11	13	9	For this is how I was commanded in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message, ‘Eat no food. Drink no water. And do not return by the way you came.’”
9195	11	13	10	So he started back on another road; he did not travel back on the same road he had taken to Bethel.
9196	11	13	11	¶Now there was an old prophet living in Bethel. When his sons came home, they told him everything the prophet had done in Bethel that day. And they told their father all the words that he had spoken to the king.
9197	11	13	12	Their father asked them, “Which road did he take?” His sons showed him the road the prophet from Judah had taken.
9198	11	13	13	He then told his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” When they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it
9199	11	13	14	and took off after the prophet, whom he found sitting under an oak tree. He asked him, “Are you the prophet from Judah?” He answered, “Yes, I am.”
9200	11	13	15	He then said to him, “Come home with me and eat something.”
9201	11	13	16	But he replied, “I can’t go back with you. I am not allowed to eat food or to drink water with you in this place.
9202	11	13	17	For an order came to me in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message, ‘Eat no food. Drink no water there. And do not return by the way you came.’”
9203	11	13	18	Then the old prophet said, “I too am a prophet like you. And an angel has told me in a message from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‘Bring him back with you to your house so he can eat food and drink water.’” But he had lied to him.
9204	11	13	19	So the prophet went back with him. He ate food in his house and he drank water.
9205	11	13	20	¶While they were sitting at the table, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to the old prophet who had brought him back.
9206	11	13	21	So he cried out to the prophet who had come from Judah, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘You have rebelled against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s instruction and have not obeyed the command the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God gave you.
9207	11	13	22	You went back. You ate food. And you drank water in the place of which he had said to you, “Eat no food. Drink no water.” Therefore your corpse will not be buried in your ancestral tomb.’”
9208	11	13	23	¶So this is what happened after he had eaten food and drunk water. The old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.
9209	11	13	24	So the prophet from Judah travelled on. Then a lion attacked him on the road and killed him.¶There was his body lying on the road, with the donkey standing next to it, and the lion just standing there by the body.
9210	11	13	25	Then some men came passing by and saw the body lying in the road with the lion standing next to the body. They went and reported what they had seen in the city where the old prophet lived.
9211	11	13	26	When the old prophet who had invited him to his house heard the news, he said, “It is the prophet who rebelled against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> delivered him over to the lion and it tore him up and killed him, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s</span> message that he had spoken to him.”
9212	11	13	27	He told his sons, “Saddle my donkey.” So they saddled it.
9213	11	13	28	He went and found the body lying in the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside it; the lion had neither eaten the body nor attacked the donkey.
9214	11	13	29	The old prophet picked up the prophet’s body, put it on the donkey, and brought it back. The old prophet then entered the city to mourn him and to bury him.
9215	11	13	30	He put the body into his own tomb, and they mourned over him, saying, “Ah, my brother!”
9216	11	13	31	After he buried him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the tomb where the prophet is buried; put my bones right beside his bones,
9217	11	13	32	because the message that he announced as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message against the altar in Bethel and against all the temples on the high places in the cities of the north will certainly be fulfilled.”
9218	11	13	33	¶After this happened, Jeroboam still did not change his evil ways; he continued to appoint common people as priests at the high places. Anyone who wanted the job he consecrated as a priest.
9219	11	13	34	This sin caused Jeroboam’s dynasty to come to an end and to be destroyed from the face of the earth.
9220	11	14	1	¶At that time Jeroboam’s son Abijah became sick.
9221	11	14	2	Jeroboam told his wife, “Disguise yourself so that people cannot recognize you are Jeroboam’s wife. Then go to Shiloh; Ahijah the prophet, who told me I would rule over this nation, lives there.
9222	11	14	3	Take ten loaves of bread, some small cakes, and a container of honey and visit him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.”
9223	11	14	4	¶Jeroboam’s wife did as she was told. She went to Shiloh and visited Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; he had lost his eyesight in his old age.
9224	11	14	5	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had told Ahijah, “Look, Jeroboam’s wife is coming to find out from you what will happen to her son, for he is sick. Tell her such-and-such. When she comes, she will be in a disguise.”
9225	11	14	6	When Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, “Come on in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you pretending to be someone else? I have been commissioned to give you bad news.
9226	11	14	7	Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said: “I raised you up from among the people and made you ruler over my people Israel.
9227	11	14	8	I tore the kingdom away from the Davidic dynasty and gave it to you. But you are not like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me wholeheartedly by doing only what I approve.
9228	11	14	9	You have sinned more than all who came before you. You went and angered me by making other gods, formed out of metal; you have completely disregarded me.
9229	11	14	10	So I am ready to bring disaster on the dynasty of Jeroboam. I will cut off every last male belonging to Jeroboam in Israel, including even the weak and incapacitated. I will burn up the dynasty of Jeroboam, just as one burns manure until it is completely consumed.
9230	11	14	11	Dogs will eat the members of your family who die in the city, and the birds of the sky will eat the ones who die in the country.”’ Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has announced it!
9231	11	14	12	¶“As for you, get up and go home. When you set foot in the city, the boy will die.
9232	11	14	13	All Israel will mourn him and bury him. He is the only one in Jeroboam’s family who will receive a decent burial, for he is the only one in whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel found anything good.
9233	11	14	14	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will raise up a king over Israel who will cut off Jeroboam’s dynasty. It is ready to happen!
9234	11	14	15	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will attack Israel, making it like a reed that sways in the water. He will remove Israel from this good land he gave to their ancestors and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they angered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by making Asherah poles.
9235	11	14	16	He will hand Israel over to their enemies because of the sins which Jeroboam committed and which he made Israel commit.”
9236	11	14	17	¶So Jeroboam’s wife got up and went back to Tirzah. As she crossed the threshold of the house, the boy died.
9237	11	14	18	All Israel buried him and mourned for him, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message that he had spoken through his servant, the prophet Ahijah.
9238	11	14	19	¶The rest of the events of Jeroboam’s reign, including the details of his battles and rule, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9239	11	14	20	Jeroboam ruled for twenty-two years; then he passed away. His son Nadab replaced him as king.
9240	11	14	21	¶Now Rehoboam son of Solomon ruled in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king and he ruled for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> chose from all the tribes of Israel to be his home. His mother was an Ammonite woman named Naamah.
9241	11	14	22	¶Judah did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They made him more jealous by their sins than their ancestors had done.
9242	11	14	23	They even built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
9243	11	14	24	There were also male cultic prostitutes in the land. They committed the same horrible sins as the nations that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had driven out from before the Israelites.
9244	11	14	25	¶In King Rehoboam’s fifth year, King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem.
9245	11	14	26	He took away the treasures of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and of the royal palace; he took everything, including all the golden shields that Solomon had made.
9246	11	14	27	King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned them to the officers of the royal guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace.
9247	11	14	28	Whenever the king visited the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, the royal guard carried them and then brought them back to the guardroom.
9248	11	14	29	¶The rest of the events of Rehoboam’s reign, including his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the ¶Kings of Judah.
9249	11	14	30	Rehoboam and Jeroboam were continually at war with each other.
9250	11	14	31	Rehoboam passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His mother was an Ammonite named Naamah. His son Abijah replaced him as king.
9251	11	15	1	¶In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijah became king over Judah.
9252	11	15	2	He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom.
9253	11	15	3	He followed all the sinful practices of his father before him. He was not wholeheartedly devoted to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God, as his ancestor David had been.
9254	11	15	4	Nevertheless for David’s sake the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God maintained his dynasty in Jerusalem by giving him a son to succeed him and by protecting Jerusalem.
9255	11	15	5	He did this because David had done what he approved and had not disregarded any of his commandments his entire lifetime, except for the incident involving Uriah the Hittite.
9256	11	15	6	Rehoboam and Jeroboam were continually at war with each other throughout Abijah’s lifetime.
9257	11	15	7	The rest of the events of Abijah’s reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah. Abijah and Jeroboam had been at war with each other.
9258	11	15	8	Abijah passed away and was buried in the City of David. His son Asa replaced him as king.
9259	11	15	9	¶In the twentieth year of Jeroboam’s reign over Israel, Asa became the king of Judah.
9260	11	15	10	He ruled for forty-one years in Jerusalem. His grandmother was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
9261	11	15	11	Asa did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved like his ancestor David had done.
9262	11	15	12	He removed the male cultic prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the disgusting idols his ancestors had made.
9263	11	15	13	He also removed Maacah his grandmother from her position as queen mother because she had made a loathsome Asherah pole. Asa cut down her loathsome pole and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
9264	11	15	14	The high places were not eliminated, yet Asa was wholeheartedly devoted to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> throughout his lifetime.
9265	11	15	15	He brought the holy items that he and his father had made into the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, including the silver, gold, and other articles.
9266	11	15	16	¶Now Asa and King Baasha of Israel were continually at war with each other.
9267	11	15	17	King Baasha of Israel attacked Judah and established Ramah as a military outpost to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the land of King Asa of Judah.
9268	11	15	18	Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and of the royal palace and handed it to his servants. He then told them to deliver it to Ben Hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, ruler in Damascus, along with this message:
9269	11	15	19	“I want to make a treaty with you, like the one our fathers made. See, I have sent you silver and gold as a present. Break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel, so he will retreat from my land.”
9270	11	15	20	Ben Hadad accepted King Asa’s offer and ordered his army commanders to attack the cities of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah, and all the territory of Naphtali, including the region of Kinnereth.
9271	11	15	21	When Baasha heard the news, he stopped fortifying Ramah and settled down in Tirzah.
9272	11	15	22	King Asa ordered all the men of Judah (no exemptions were granted) to carry away the stones and wood that Baasha had used to build Ramah. King Asa used the materials to build up Geba (in Benjamin) and Mizpah.
9273	11	15	23	¶The rest of the events of Asa’s reign, including all his successes and accomplishments, as well as a record of the cities he built, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah. Yet when he was very old he developed a foot disease.
9274	11	15	24	Asa passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the city of his ancestor David. His son Jehoshaphat replaced him as king.
9275	11	15	25	¶In the second year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Jeroboam’s son Nadab became the king of Israel; he ruled Israel for two years.
9276	11	15	26	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He followed in his father’s footsteps and encouraged Israel to sin.
9277	11	15	27	¶Baasha son of Ahijah, from the tribe of Issachar, conspired against Nadab and assassinated him in Gibbethon, which was in Philistine territory. This happened while Nadab and all the Israelite army were besieging Gibbethon.
9278	11	15	28	Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa’s reign over Judah and replaced him as king.
9279	11	15	29	When he became king, he executed Jeroboam’s entire family. He wiped out everyone who breathed, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message that he had spoken through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite.
9280	11	15	30	This happened because of the sins which Jeroboam committed and which he made Israel commit. These sins angered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
9281	11	15	31	¶The rest of the events of Nadab’s reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9282	11	15	32	Asa and King Baasha of Israel were continually at war with each other.
9283	11	15	33	¶In the third year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah; he ruled for twenty-four years.
9284	11	15	34	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; he followed in Jeroboam’s footsteps and encouraged Israel to sin.
9285	11	16	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s</span> message against Baasha came to Jehu son of Hanani:
9286	11	16	2	“I raised you up from the dust and made you ruler over my people Israel. Yet you followed in Jeroboam’s footsteps and encouraged my people Israel to sin; their sins have made me angry.
9287	11	16	3	So I am ready to burn up Baasha and his family, and make your family like the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat.
9288	11	16	4	Dogs will eat the members of Baasha’s family who die in the city, and the birds of the sky will eat the ones who die in the country.”
9289	11	16	5	¶The rest of the events of Baasha’s reign, including his accomplishments and successes, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9290	11	16	6	Baasha passed away and was buried in Tirzah. His son Elah replaced him as king.
9291	11	16	7	And so it was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s</span> message came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha and his family. This was because of all the evil he had done in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s</span> view, by angering him with his deeds and becoming like Jereboam’s dynasty, and because of how he had destroyed Jeroboam’s dynasty.
9292	11	16	8	¶In the twenty-sixth year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Baasha’s son Elah became king over Israel; he ruled in Tirzah for two years.
9293	11	16	9	His servant Zimri, a commander of half of his chariot force, conspired against him. While Elah was in Tirzah drinking heavily at the house of Arza, who supervised the palace in Tirzah,
9294	11	16	10	Zimri came in and struck him dead. (This happened in the twenty-seventh year of Asa’s reign over Judah.) Zimri replaced Elah as king.
9295	11	16	11	When he became king and occupied the throne, he killed Baasha’s entire family. He did not spare any male belonging to him; he killed his relatives and his friends.
9296	11	16	12	Zimri destroyed Baasha’s entire family, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message which he had spoken against Baasha through Jehu the prophet.
9297	11	16	13	This happened because of all the sins which Baasha and his son Elah committed and which they made Israel commit. They angered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel with their worthless idols.
9298	11	16	14	¶The rest of the events of Elah’s reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9299	11	16	15	¶In the twenty-seventh year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Zimri became king over Israel; he ruled for seven days in Tirzah. Zimri’s revolt took place while the army was deployed in Gibbethon, which was in Philistine territory.
9300	11	16	16	While deployed there, the army received this report: “Zimri has conspired against the king and assassinated him.” So all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that very day in the camp.
9301	11	16	17	Omri and all Israel went up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah.
9302	11	16	18	When Zimri saw that the city was captured, he went into the fortified area of the royal palace. He set the palace on fire and died in the flames.
9303	11	16	19	This happened because of the sins he committed. He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and followed in Jeroboam’s footsteps and encouraged Israel to continue sinning.
9304	11	16	20	¶The rest of the events of Zimri’s reign, including the details of his revolt, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9305	11	16	21	¶At that time the people of Israel were divided in their loyalties. Half the people supported Tibni son of Ginath and wanted to make him king; the other half supported Omri.
9306	11	16	22	Omri’s supporters were stronger than those who supported Tibni son of Ginath. Tibni died; Omri became king.
9307	11	16	23	¶In the thirty-first year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Omri became king over Israel. He ruled for twelve years, six of them in Tirzah.
9308	11	16	24	He purchased the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver. He launched a construction project there and named the city he built after Shemer, the former owner of the hill of Samaria.
9309	11	16	25	Omri did more evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> than all who were before him.
9310	11	16	26	He followed in the footsteps of Jeroboam son of Nebat and encouraged Israel to sin; they angered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel with their worthless idols.
9311	11	16	27	¶The rest of the events of Omri’s reign, including his accomplishments and successes, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9312	11	16	28	Omri passed away and was buried in Samaria. His son Ahab replaced him as king.
9313	11	16	29	¶In the thirty-eighth year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Omri’s son Ahab became king over Israel. Ahab son of Omri ruled over Israel for twenty-two years in Samaria.
9314	11	16	30	Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> than all who were before him.
9315	11	16	31	As if following in the sinful footsteps of Jeroboam son of Nebat were not bad enough, he married Jezebel the daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians. Then he worshiped and bowed to Baal.
9316	11	16	32	He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal he had built in Samaria.
9317	11	16	33	Ahab also made an Asherah pole; he did more to anger the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
9318	11	16	34	¶During Ahab’s reign, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho. Abiram, his firstborn son, died when he laid the foundation; Segub, his youngest son, died when he erected its gates, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message that he had spoken through Joshua son of Nun.
9319	11	17	1	¶Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel lives (whom I serve), there will be no dew or rain in the years ahead unless I give the command.”
9320	11	17	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to him:
9321	11	17	3	“Leave here and travel eastward. Hide out in the Kerith Valley near the Jordan.
9322	11	17	4	Drink from the stream; I have already told the ravens to bring you food there.”
9323	11	17	5	So he carried out the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message; he went and lived in the Kerith Valley near the Jordan.
9324	11	17	6	The ravens would bring him bread and meat each morning and evening, and he would drink from the stream.
9325	11	17	7	¶After a while, the stream dried up because there had been no rain in the land.
9326	11	17	8	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to him,
9327	11	17	9	“Get up, go to Zarephath in Sidonian territory, and live there. I have already told a widow who lives there to provide for you.”
9328	11	17	10	So he got up and went to Zarephath. When he went through the city gate, there was a widow gathering wood. He called out to her, “Please give me a little water in a cup, so I can take a drink.”
9329	11	17	11	As she went to get it, he called out to her, “Please bring me a piece of bread.”
9330	11	17	12	She said, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God lives, I have no food, except for a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. Right now I am gathering a couple of sticks for a fire. Then I’m going home to make one final meal for my son and myself. After we have eaten that, we will die of starvation.”
9331	11	17	13	Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do as you planned. But first make me a small cake and bring it to me; then make something for yourself and your son.
9332	11	17	14	For this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said, ‘The jar of flour will not be empty and the jug of oil will not run out until the day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> makes it rain on the surface of the ground.’”
9333	11	17	15	She went and did as Elijah told her; there was always enough food for Elijah and for her and her family.
9334	11	17	16	The jar of flour was never empty and the jug of oil never ran out, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message that he had spoken through Elijah.
9335	11	17	17	¶After this the son of the woman who owned the house got sick. His illness was so severe he could no longer breathe.
9336	11	17	18	She asked Elijah, “Why, prophet, have you come to me to confront me with my sin and kill my son?”
9337	11	17	19	He said to her, “Hand me your son.” He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him down on his bed.
9338	11	17	20	Then he called out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, my God, are you also bringing disaster on this widow I am staying with by killing her son?”
9339	11	17	21	He stretched out over the boy three times and called out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, my God, please let this boy’s breath return to him.”
9340	11	17	22	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answered Elijah’s prayer; the boy’s breath returned to him and he lived.
9341	11	17	23	Elijah took the boy, brought him down from the upper room to the house, and handed him to his mother. Elijah then said, “See, your son is alive!”
9342	11	17	24	The woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a prophet and that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message really does come through you.”
9343	11	18	1	¶Some time later, in the third year of the famine, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s </span>message came to Elijah, “Go, make an appearance before Ahab, so I may send rain on the surface of the ground.”
9344	11	18	2	So Elijah went to make an appearance before Ahab.¶Now the famine was severe in Samaria.
9345	11	18	3	So Ahab summoned Obadiah, who supervised the palace. (Now Obadiah was a very loyal follower of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
9346	11	18	4	When Jezebel was killing the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s prophets, Obadiah took one hundred prophets and hid them in two caves in two groups of fifty. He also brought them food and water.)
9347	11	18	5	Ahab told Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grazing areas so we can keep the horses and mules alive and not have to kill some of the animals.”
9348	11	18	6	They divided up the land between them to search it; Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went the other way by himself.
9349	11	18	7	¶As Obadiah was traveling along, Elijah met him. When he recognized him, he fell facedown to the ground and said, “Is it really you, my master, Elijah?”
9350	11	18	8	He replied, “Yes, go and say to your master, ‘Elijah is back.’”
9351	11	18	9	Obadiah said, “What sin have I committed that you are ready to hand your servant over to Ahab for execution?
9352	11	18	10	As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God lives, my master has sent to every nation and kingdom in an effort to find you. When they say, ‘He’s not here,’ he makes them swear an oath that they could not find you.
9353	11	18	11	Now you say, ‘Go and say to your master, “Elijah is back.”’
9354	11	18	12	But when I leave you, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit will carry you away so I can’t find you. If I go tell Ahab I’ve seen you, he won’t be able to find you and he will kill me. That would not be fair, because your servant has been a loyal follower of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from my youth.
9355	11	18	13	Certainly my master is aware of what I did when Jezebel was killing the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s prophets. I hid one hundred of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s prophets in two caves in two groups of fifty and I brought them food and water.
9356	11	18	14	Now you say, ‘Go and say to your master, “Elijah is back,”’ but he will kill me.”
9357	11	18	15	But Elijah said, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies lives (whom I serve), I will make an appearance before him today.”
9358	11	18	16	¶When Obadiah went and informed Ahab, the king went to meet Elijah.
9359	11	18	17	When Ahab saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is it really you, the one who brings disaster on Israel?”
9360	11	18	18	Elijah replied, “I have not brought disaster on Israel. But you and your father’s dynasty have, by abandoning the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commandments and following the Baals.
9361	11	18	19	Now send out messengers and assemble all Israel before me at Mount Carmel, as well as the 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of Asherah whom Jezebel supports.”
9362	11	18	20	¶Ahab sent messengers to all the Israelites and had the prophets assemble at Mount Carmel.
9363	11	18	21	Elijah approached all the people and said, “How long are you going to be paralyzed by indecision? If the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the true God, then follow him, but if Baal is, follow him!” But the people did not say a word.
9364	11	18	22	Elijah said to them: “I am the only prophet of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who is left, but there are 450 prophets of Baal.
9365	11	18	23	Let them bring us two bulls. Let them choose one of the bulls for themselves, cut it up into pieces, and place it on the wood. But they must not set it on fire. I will do the same to the other bull and place it on the wood. But I will not set it on fire.
9366	11	18	24	Then you will invoke the name of your god, and I will invoke the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The god who responds with fire will demonstrate that he is the true God.” All the people responded, “This will be a fair test.”
9367	11	18	25	¶Elijah told the prophets of Baal, “Choose one of the bulls for yourselves and go first, for you are the majority. Invoke the name of your god, but do not light a fire.”
9368	11	18	26	So they took a bull, as he had suggested, and prepared it. They invoked the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “Baal, answer us.” But there was no sound and no answer. They jumped around on the altar they had made.
9369	11	18	27	At noon Elijah mocked them, “Yell louder! After all, he is a god; he may be deep in thought, or perhaps he stepped out for a moment or has taken a trip. Perhaps he is sleeping and needs to be awakened.”
9370	11	18	28	So they yelled louder and, in accordance with their prescribed ritual, mutilated themselves with swords and spears until their bodies were covered with blood.
9371	11	18	29	Throughout the afternoon they were in an ecstatic frenzy, but there was no sound, no answer, and no response.
9372	11	18	30	¶Elijah then told all the people, “Approach me.” So all the people approached him. He repaired the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that had been torn down.
9373	11	18	31	Then Elijah took twelve stones, corresponding to the number of tribes that descended from Jacob, to whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message had come, “Israel will be your name.”
9374	11	18	32	With the stones he constructed an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Around the altar he made a trench large enough to contain two seahs of seed.
9375	11	18	33	He arranged the wood, cut up the bull, and placed it on the wood. Then he said, “Fill four water jars and pour the water on the offering and the wood.”
9376	11	18	34	When they had done so, he said, “Do it again.” So they did it again. Then he said, “Do it a third time.” So they did it a third time.
9377	11	18	35	The water flowed down all sides of the altar and filled the trench.
9378	11	18	36	When it was time for the evening offering, Elijah the prophet approached the altar and prayed: “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, prove today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.
9379	11	18	37	Answer me, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, answer me, so these people will know that you, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, are the true God and that you are winning back their allegiance.”
9380	11	18	38	Then fire from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> fell from the sky. It consumed the offering, the wood, the stones, and the dirt, and licked up the water in the trench.
9381	11	18	39	When all the people saw this, they threw themselves down with their faces to the ground and said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the true God! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the true God!”
9382	11	18	40	Elijah told them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Don’t let even one of them escape!” So they seized them, and Elijah led them down to the Kishon Valley and executed them there.
9383	11	18	41	¶Then Elijah told Ahab, “Go on up and eat and drink, for the sound of a heavy rainstorm can be heard.”
9384	11	18	42	So Ahab went on up to eat and drink, while Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel. He bent down toward the ground and put his face between his knees.
9385	11	18	43	He told his servant, “Go on up and look in the direction of the sea.” So he went on up, looked, and reported, “There is nothing.” Seven times Elijah sent him to look.
9386	11	18	44	The seventh time the servant said, “Look, a small cloud, the size of the palm of a man’s hand, is rising up from the sea.” Elijah then said, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Hitch up the chariots and go down, so that the rain won’t overtake you.’”
9387	11	18	45	Meanwhile the sky was covered with dark clouds, the wind blew, and there was a heavy rainstorm. Ahab rode toward Jezreel.
9388	11	18	46	Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> energized Elijah with power; he tucked his robe into his belt and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
9389	11	19	1	¶Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, including a detailed account of how he killed all the prophets with the sword.
9390	11	19	2	Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah with this warning, “May the gods judge me severely if by this time tomorrow I do not take your life as you did theirs!”
9391	11	19	3	¶Elijah was afraid, so he got up and fled for his life to Beer Sheba in Judah. He left his servant there,
9392	11	19	4	while he went a day’s journey into the wilderness. He went and sat down under a shrub and asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to take his life: “I’ve had enough! Now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, take my life. After all, I’m no better than my ancestors.”
9393	11	19	5	He stretched out and fell asleep under the shrub. All of a sudden an angelic messenger touched him and said, “Get up and eat.”
9394	11	19	6	He looked and right there by his head was a cake baking on hot coals and a jug of water. He ate and drank and then slept some more.
9395	11	19	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel came back again, touched him, and said, “Get up and eat, for otherwise you won’t be able to make the journey.”
9396	11	19	8	So he got up and ate and drank. That meal gave him the strength to travel forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.
9397	11	19	9	¶He went into a cave there and spent the night. All of a sudden the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to him, “Why are you here, Elijah?”
9398	11	19	10	He answered, “I have been absolutely loyal to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, even though the Israelites have abandoned the covenant they made with you, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left and now they want to take my life.”
9399	11	19	11	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is ready to pass by.”¶A very powerful wind went before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, digging into the mountain and causing landslides, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was not in the wind. After the windstorm there was an earthquake, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was not in the earthquake.
9400	11	19	12	After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a soft whisper.
9401	11	19	13	When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his robe and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. All of a sudden a voice asked him, “Why are you here, Elijah?”
9402	11	19	14	He answered, “I have been absolutely loyal to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, even though the Israelites have abandoned the covenant they made with you torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left and now they want to take my life.”
9403	11	19	15	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Go back the way you came and then head for the wilderness of Damascus. Go and anoint Hazael king over Syria.
9404	11	19	16	You must anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to take your place as prophet.
9405	11	19	17	Jehu will kill anyone who escapes Hazael’s sword, and Elisha will kill anyone who escapes Jehu’s sword.
9406	11	19	18	I still have left in Israel seven thousand followers who have not bowed their knees to Baal or kissed the images of him.”
9407	11	19	19	¶Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen; he was near the twelfth pair. Elijah passed by him and threw his robe over him.
9408	11	19	20	He left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, then I will follow you.” Elijah said to him, “Go back! Indeed, what have I done to you?”
9409	11	19	21	Elisha went back and took his pair of oxen and slaughtered them. He cooked the meat over a fire that he made by burning the harness and yoke. He gave the people meat and they ate. Then he got up and followed Elijah and became his assistant.
9410	11	20	1	¶Now King Ben Hadad of Syria assembled all his army, along with thirty-two other kings with their horses and chariots. He marched against Samaria and besieged and attacked it.
9411	11	20	2	He sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel, who was in the city. He said to him, “This is what Ben Hadad says,
9412	11	20	3	‘Your silver and your gold are mine, as well as the best of your wives and sons.’”
9413	11	20	4	The king of Israel replied, “It is just as you say, my master, O king. I and all I own belong to you.”
9414	11	20	5	¶The messengers came again and said, “This is what Ben Hadad says, ‘I sent this message to you, “You must give me your silver, gold, wives, and sons.”
9415	11	20	6	But now at this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you and they will search through your palace and your servants’ houses. They will carry away all your valuables.’”
9416	11	20	7	The king of Israel summoned all the leaders of the land and said, “Notice how this man is looking for trouble. Indeed, he demanded my wives, sons, silver, and gold, and I did not resist him.”
9417	11	20	8	All the leaders and people said to him, “Do not give in or agree to his demands.”
9418	11	20	9	So he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, “Say this to my master, the king, ‘I will give you everything you demanded at first from your servant, but I am unable to agree to this latest demand.’” So the messengers went back and gave their report.
9419	11	20	10	¶Ben Hadad sent another message to him, “May the gods judge me severely if there is enough dirt left in Samaria for all my soldiers to scoop up in their hands.”
9420	11	20	11	The king of Israel replied, “Tell him the one who puts on his battle gear should not boast like one who is taking it off.”
9421	11	20	12	When Ben Hadad received this reply, he and the other kings were drinking in their quarters. He ordered his servants, “Get ready to attack!” So they got ready to attack the city.
9422	11	20	13	¶Now a prophet visited King Ahab of Israel and said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘Do you see this huge army? Look, I am going to hand it over to you this very day. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.’”</span>
9423	11	20	14	Ahab asked, “By whom will this be accomplished?” He answered, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘By the servants of the district governors.’” Ahab asked, “Who will launch the attack?” He answered, “You will.”
9424	11	20	15	¶So Ahab assembled the 232 servants of the district governors. After that he assembled all the Israelite army, numbering 7,000.
9425	11	20	16	They marched out at noon, while Ben Hadad and the thirty-two kings allied with him were drinking heavily in their quarters.
9426	11	20	17	The servants of the district governors led the march. When Ben Hadad sent messengers, they reported back to him, “Men are marching out of Samaria.”
9427	11	20	18	He ordered, “Whether they come in peace or to do battle, take them alive.”
9428	11	20	19	They marched out of the city with the servants of the district governors in the lead and the army behind them.
9429	11	20	20	Each one struck down an enemy soldier; the Syrians fled and Israel chased them. King Ben Hadad of Syria escaped on horseback with some horsemen.
9430	11	20	21	Then the king of Israel marched out and struck down the horses and chariots; he thoroughly defeated Syria.
9431	11	20	22	¶The prophet visited the king of Israel and instructed him, “Go, fortify your defenses. Determine what you must do, for in the spring the king of Syria will attack you.”
9432	11	20	23	Now the advisers of the king of Syria said to him: “Their God is a god of the mountains. That’s why they overpowered us. But if we fight them in the plains, we will certainly overpower them.
9433	11	20	24	So do this: Dismiss the kings from their command, and replace them with military commanders.
9434	11	20	25	Muster an army like the one you lost, with the same number of horses and chariots. Then we will fight them in the plains; we will certainly overpower them.” He approved their plan and did as they advised.
9435	11	20	26	¶In the spring Ben Hadad mustered the Syrian army and marched to Aphek to fight Israel.
9436	11	20	27	When the Israelites had mustered and had received their supplies, they marched out to face them in battle. When the Israelites deployed opposite them, they were like two small flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the land.
9437	11	20	28	The prophet visited the king of Israel and said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: ‘Because the Syrians said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys,” I will deliver this entire huge army into to your control. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
9438	11	20	29	¶The armies were deployed opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day the battle began, and the Israelites killed 100,000 Syrian foot soldiers in one day.
9439	11	20	30	The remaining 27,000 ran to Aphek and went into the city, but the wall fell on them. Now Ben Hadad ran into the city and hid in an inner room.
9440	11	20	31	His advisers said to him, “Look, we have heard that the kings of the Israelite dynasty are kind. Allow us to put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads and surrender to the king of Israel. Maybe he will spare our lives.”
9441	11	20	32	So they put sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel. They said, “Your servant Ben Hadad says, ‘Please let me live!’” Ahab replied, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”
9442	11	20	33	The men took this as a good omen and quickly accepted his offer, saying, “Ben Hadad is your brother.” Ahab then said, “Go, get him.” So Ben Hadad came out to him, and Ahab pulled him up into his chariot.
9443	11	20	34	Ben Hadad said, “I will return the cities my father took from your father. You may set up markets in Damascus, just as my father did in Samaria.” Ahab then said, “I want to make a treaty with you before I dismiss you.” So he made a treaty with him and then dismissed him.
9444	11	20	35	¶One of the members of the prophetic guild, told his companion a message from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Please wound me!” But the man refused to wound him.
9445	11	20	36	So the prophet said to him, “Because you have disobeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you.” When he left him, a lion attacked and killed him.
9446	11	20	37	He found another man and said, “Wound me!” So the man wounded him severely.
9447	11	20	38	The prophet then went and stood by the road, waiting for the king. He also disguised himself by putting a bandage down over his eyes.
9448	11	20	39	When the king passed by, he called out to the king, “Your servant went out into the heat of the battle, and then a man turned aside and brought me a prisoner. He told me, ‘Guard this prisoner. If he ends up missing for any reason, you will pay with your life or with a talent of silver.’
9449	11	20	40	Well, it just so happened that while your servant was doing this and that, he disappeared.” The king of Israel said to him, “Your punishment is already determined by your own testimony.”
9450	11	20	41	The prophet quickly removed the bandage from his eyes and the king of Israel recognized he was one of the prophets.
9451	11	20	42	The prophet then said to him, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘Because you released a man I had determined should die, you will pay with your life and your people will suffer instead of his people.’”
9452	11	20	43	The king of Israel went home to Samaria bitter and angry.
9453	11	21	1	¶After this the following episode took place. Naboth the Jezreelite owned a vineyard in Jezreel adjacent to the palace of King Ahab of Samaria.
9454	11	21	2	Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard so I can make a vegetable garden out of it, for it is adjacent to my palace. I will give you an even better vineyard in its place, or if you prefer, I will pay you silver for it.”
9455	11	21	3	But Naboth replied to Ahab, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> forbid that I should sell you my ancestral inheritance.”
9456	11	21	4	¶So Ahab went into his palace, bitter and angry that Naboth the Jezreelite had said, “I will not sell to you my ancestral inheritance.” He lay down on his bed, pouted, and would not eat.
9457	11	21	5	Then his wife Jezebel came in and said to him, “Why do you have a bitter attitude and refuse to eat?”
9458	11	21	6	He answered her, “While I was talking to Naboth the Jezreelite, I said to him, ‘Sell me your vineyard for silver, or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.’ But he said, ‘I will not sell you my vineyard.’”
9459	11	21	7	His wife Jezebel said to him, “You are the king of Israel! Get up, eat some food, and have a good time. I will get the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite for you.”
9460	11	21	8	¶She wrote out orders, signed Ahab’s name to them, and sealed them with his seal. She then sent the orders to the leaders and to the nobles who lived in Naboth’s city.
9461	11	21	9	This is what she wrote: “Observe a time of fasting and seat Naboth in front of the people.
9462	11	21	10	Also seat two villains opposite him and have them testify, ‘You cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out and stone him to death.”
9463	11	21	11	¶The men of the city, the leaders and the nobles who lived there, followed the written orders Jezebel had sent them.
9464	11	21	12	They observed a time of fasting and put Naboth in front of the people.
9465	11	21	13	The two villains arrived and sat opposite him. Then the villains testified against Naboth right before the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they dragged him outside the city and stoned him to death.
9466	11	21	14	Then they reported to Jezebel, “Naboth has been stoned to death.”
9467	11	21	15	¶When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, “Get up, take possession of the vineyard Naboth the Jezreelite refused to sell you for silver, for Naboth is no longer alive; he’s dead.”
9468	11	21	16	When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
9469	11	21	17	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s</span> message came to Elijah the Tishbite:
9470	11	21	18	“Get up, go down and meet King Ahab of Israel who lives in Samaria. He is at the vineyard of Naboth; he has gone down there to take possession of it.
9471	11	21	19	Say to him, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: “Haven’t you committed murder and taken possession of the property of the deceased?”’ Then say to him, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: “In the spot where dogs licked up Naboth’s blood they will also lick up your blood – yes, yours!”’”
9472	11	21	20	¶When Elijah arrived, Ahab said to him, “So, you have found me, my enemy!” Elijah replied, “I have found you, because you are committed to doing evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
9473	11	21	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘Look, I am ready to bring disaster on you. I will destroy you and cut off every last male belonging to Ahab in Israel, including even the weak and incapacitated.
9474	11	21	22	I will make your dynasty like those of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah because you angered me and made Israel sin.’
9475	11	21	23	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says this about Jezebel, ‘Dogs will devour Jezebel by the outer wall of Jezreel.’
9476	11	21	24	As for Ahab’s family, dogs will eat the ones who die in the city, and the birds of the sky will eat the ones who die in the country.”
9477	11	21	25	(There had never been anyone like Ahab, who was firmly committed to doing evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, urged on by his wife Jezebel.
9478	11	21	26	He was so wicked he worshiped the disgusting idols, just like the Amorites whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had driven out from before the Israelites.)
9479	11	21	27	¶When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted. He slept in sackcloth and walked around dejected.
9480	11	21	28	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Elijah the Tishbite,
9481	11	21	29	“Have you noticed how Ahab shows remorse before me? Because he shows remorse before me, I will not bring disaster on his dynasty during his lifetime, but during the reign of his son.”
9482	11	22	1	¶There was no war between Syria and Israel for three years.
9483	11	22	2	In the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah came down to visit the king of Israel.
9484	11	22	3	The king of Israel said to his servants, “Surely you recognize that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us, though we are hesitant to reclaim it from the king of Syria.”
9485	11	22	4	Then he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to attack Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I will support you; my army and horses are at your disposal.”
9486	11	22	5	But then Jehoshaphat said to Israel’s king, “Please seek a message from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> this very day.”
9487	11	22	6	So the king of Israel assembled about four hundred prophets and asked them, “Should I attack Ramoth Gilead or not?” They said, “Attack! The Sovereign One will hand it over to the king.”
9488	11	22	7	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not a prophet of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> still here, that we may ask him?”
9489	11	22	8	The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man through whom we can seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s will. But I despise him because he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster. His name is Micaiah son of Imlah.” Jehoshaphat said, “The king should not say such things.”
9490	11	22	9	The king of Israel summoned an official and said, “Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah.”
9491	11	22	10	¶Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their respective thrones, dressed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. All the prophets were prophesying before them.
9492	11	22	11	Zedekiah son of Kenaanah made iron horns and said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘With these you will gore Syria until they are destroyed.’”
9493	11	22	12	All the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Attack Ramoth Gilead! You will succeed; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will hand it over to the king.”
9494	11	22	13	Now the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the prophets are in complete agreement that the king will succeed. Your words must agree with theirs; you must predict success.”
9495	11	22	14	But Micaiah said, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, I will say what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> tells me to say.”
9496	11	22	15	¶When he came before the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth Gilead or not?” He answered him, “Attack! You will succeed; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will hand it over to the king.”
9497	11	22	16	The king said to him, “How many times must I make you solemnly promise in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to tell me only the truth?”
9498	11	22	17	Micaiah said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep that have no shepherd. Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‘They have no master. They should go home in peace.’”
9499	11	22	18	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster?”
9500	11	22	19	Micaiah said, “That being the case, listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message. I saw the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sitting on his throne, with all the heavenly assembly standing beside him on his right and on his left.
9501	11	22	20	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‘Who will deceive Ahab, so he will attack Ramoth Gilead and die there?’ One said this and another that.
9502	11	22	21	Then a spirit stepped forward and stood before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He said, ‘I will deceive him.’
9503	11	22	22	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> asked him, ‘How?’ He replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‘Deceive and overpower him. Go out and do as you have proposed.’
9504	11	22	23	So now, look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has placed a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has decreed disaster for you.”
9505	11	22	24	Zedekiah son of Kenaanah approached, hit Micaiah on the jaw, and said, “Which way did the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s spirit go when he went from me to speak to you?”
9506	11	22	25	Micaiah replied, “Look, you will see in the day when you go into an inner room to hide.”
9507	11	22	26	Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the city official and Joash the king’s son.
9508	11	22	27	Say, ‘This is what the king says, “Put this man in prison. Give him only a little bread and water until I safely return.”’”
9509	11	22	28	Micaiah said, “If you really do safely return, then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Take note, all you people.”
9510	11	22	29	¶The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah attacked Ramoth Gilead.
9511	11	22	30	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and then enter into the battle, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and then entered into the battle.
9512	11	22	31	Now the king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight common soldiers or high-ranking officers; fight only the king of Israel.”
9513	11	22	32	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “He must be the king of Israel.” So they turned and attacked him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.
9514	11	22	33	When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him.
9515	11	22	34	Now an archer shot an arrow at random, and it struck the king of Israel between the plates of his armor. The king ordered his charioteer, “Turn around and take me from the battle line, because I’m wounded.”
9516	11	22	35	While the battle raged throughout the day, the king stood propped up in his chariot opposite the Syrians. He died in the evening; the blood from the wound ran down into the bottom of the chariot.
9517	11	22	36	As the sun was setting, a cry went through the camp, “Each one should return to his city and to his homeland.”
9518	11	22	37	So the king died and was taken to Samaria, where they buried him.
9519	11	22	38	They washed off the chariot at the pool of Samaria. Then the dogs licked his blood, while the the prostitutes bathed, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s</span> message that he had spoken.
9520	11	22	39	¶The rest of the events of Ahab’s reign, including a record of his accomplishments and how he built a luxurious palace and various cities, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9521	11	22	40	Ahab passed away. His son Ahaziah replaced him as king.
9522	11	22	41	¶In the fourth year of Ahab’s reign over Israel, Asa’s son Jehoshaphat became king over Judah.
9523	11	22	42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
9524	11	22	43	He followed in his father Asa’s footsteps and was careful to do what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved. (22:44) However, the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places.
9525	11	22	44	(22:45) Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel.
9526	11	22	45	¶The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, including his successes and military exploits, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
9527	11	22	46	He removed from the land any male cultic prostitutes who had managed to survive the reign of his father Asa.
9528	11	22	47	There was no king in Edom at this time; a governor ruled.
9529	11	22	48	Jehoshaphat built a fleet of large merchant ships to travel to Ophir for gold, but they never made the voyage because they were shipwrecked in Ezion Geber.
9530	11	22	49	Then Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my sailors join yours in the fleet,” but Jehoshaphat refused.
9531	11	22	50	¶Jehoshaphat passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the city of his ancestor David. His son Jehoram replaced him as king.
9532	11	22	51	¶In the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Ahab’s son Ahaziah became king over Israel in Samaria. He ruled for two years over Israel.
9533	11	22	52	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and followed in the footsteps of his father and mother; like Jeroboam son of Nebat, he encouraged Israel to sin.
9534	11	22	53	He worshiped and bowed down to Baal, angering the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel just as his father had done.
9535	12	1	1	¶After Ahab died, Moab rebelled against Israel.
9536	12	1	2	Ahaziah fell through a window lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria and was injured. He sent messengers with these orders, “Go, ask Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, if I will survive this injury.”
9537	12	1	3	¶But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel told Elijah the Tishbite, “Get up, go to meet the messengers from the king of Samaria. Say this to them: ‘You must think there is no God in Israel! That explains why you are on your way to seek an oracle from Baal Zebub the god of Ekron.
9538	12	1	4	Therefore this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, “You will not leave the bed you lie on, for you will certainly die!”’” So Elijah went on his way.
9539	12	1	5	¶When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have you returned?”
9540	12	1	6	They replied, “A man came up to meet us. He told us, “Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: “You must think there is no God in Israel! That explains why you are sending for an oracle from Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron. Therefore you will not leave the bed you lie on, for you will certainly die.”’”
9541	12	1	7	The king asked them, “Describe the appearance of this man who came up to meet you and told you these things.”
9542	12	1	8	They replied, “He was a hairy man and had a leather belt tied around his waist.” The king said, “He is Elijah the Tishbite.”
9543	12	1	9	¶The king sent a captain and his fifty soldiers to retrieve Elijah. The captain went up to him, while he was sitting on the top of a hill. He told him, “Prophet, the king says, ‘Come down!’”
9544	12	1	10	Elijah replied to the captain, “If I am indeed a prophet, may fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty soldiers!” Fire then came down from the sky and consumed him and his fifty soldiers.
9545	12	1	11	¶The king sent another captain and his fifty soldiers to retrieve Elijah. He went up and told him, “Prophet, this is what the king says, ‘Come down at once!’”
9546	12	1	12	Elijah replied to them, “If I am indeed a prophet, may fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty soldiers!” Fire from God came down from the sky and consumed him and his fifty soldiers.
9547	12	1	13	¶The king sent a third captain and his fifty soldiers. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. He begged for mercy, “Prophet, please have respect for my life and for the lives of these fifty servants of yours.
9548	12	1	14	Indeed, fire came down from the sky and consumed the two captains who came before me, along with their men. So now, please have respect for my life.”
9549	12	1	15	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.” So he got up and went down with him to the king.
9550	12	1	16	¶Elijah said to the king, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘You sent messengers to seek an oracle from Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron. Is it because there is no God in Israel from whom you can seek a message? Therefore you will not leave the bed you lie on, for you will certainly die.’”
9551	12	1	17	¶And he did die in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message that he had spoken through Elijah. In the second year of the reign of King Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat over Judah, Ahaziah’s brother Jehoram replaced him as king of Israel, because he had no son.
9552	12	1	18	The rest of the events of Ahaziah’s reign, including his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9553	12	2	1	¶Just before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> took Elijah up to heaven in a windstorm, Elijah and Elisha were traveling from Gilgal.
9554	12	2	2	Elijah told Elisha, “Stay here, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent me to Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.
9555	12	2	3	Some members of the prophetic guild in Bethel came out to Elisha and said, “Do you know that today the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is going to take your master from you?” He answered, “Yes, I know. Be quiet.”
9556	12	2	4	¶Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent me to Jericho.” But he replied, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So they went to Jericho.
9557	12	2	5	Some members of the prophetic guild in Jericho approached Elisha and said, “Do you know that today the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is going to take your master from you?” He answered, “Yes, I know. Be quiet.”
9558	12	2	6	¶Elijah said to him, “Stay here, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent me to the Jordan.” But he replied, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So they traveled on together.
9559	12	2	7	The fifty members of the prophetic guild went and stood opposite them at a distance, while Elijah and Elisha stood by the Jordan.
9560	12	2	8	Elijah took his cloak, folded it up, and hit the water with it. The water divided, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
9561	12	2	9	¶When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “What can I do for you, before I am taken away from you?” Elisha answered, “May I receive a double portion of the prophetic spirit that energizes you.”
9562	12	2	10	Elijah replied, “That’s a difficult request! If you see me taken from you, may it be so, but if you don’t, it will not happen.”
9563	12	2	11	¶As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a fiery chariot pulled by fiery horses appeared. They went between Elijah and Elisha, and Elijah went up to heaven in a windstorm.
9564	12	2	12	While Elisha was watching, he was crying out, “My father, my father! The chariot and horsemen of Israel!” Then he could no longer see him. He grabbed his clothes and tore them in two.
9565	12	2	13	He picked up Elijah’s cloak, which had fallen off him, and went back and stood on the shore of the Jordan.
9566	12	2	14	He took the cloak that had fallen off Elijah, hit the water with it, and said, “Where is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of Elijah?” When he hit the water, it divided and Elisha crossed over.
9567	12	2	15	¶When the members of the prophetic guild in Jericho, who were standing at a distance, saw him do this, they said, “The spirit that energized Elijah rests upon Elisha.” They went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him.
9568	12	2	16	They said to him, “Look, there are fifty capable men with your servants. Let them go and look for your master, for the wind sent from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> may have carried him away and dropped him on one of the hills or in one of the valleys.” But Elisha replied, “Don’t send them out.”
9569	12	2	17	But they were so insistent, he became embarrassed. So he said, “Send them out.” They sent the fifty men out and they looked for three days, but could not find Elijah.
9570	12	2	18	When they came back, Elisha was staying in Jericho. He said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go’?”
9571	12	2	19	¶The men of the city said to Elisha, “Look, the city has a good location, as our master can see. But the water is bad and the land doesn’t produce crops.”
9572	12	2	20	Elisha said, “Get me a new jar and put some salt in it.” So they got it.
9573	12	2	21	He went out to the spring and threw the salt in. Then he said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘I have purified this water. It will no longer cause death or fail to produce crops.”
9574	12	2	22	The water has been pure to this very day, just as Elisha prophesied.
9575	12	2	23	¶He went up from there to Bethel. As he was traveling up the road, some young boys came out of the city and made fun of him, saying, “Go on up, baldy! Go on up, baldy!”
9576	12	2	24	When he turned around and saw them, he called God’s judgment down on them. Two female bears came out of the woods and ripped forty-two of the boys to pieces.
9577	12	2	25	From there he traveled to Mount Carmel and then back to Samaria.
9578	12	3	1	¶In the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Ahab’s son Jehoram became king over Israel in Samaria; he ruled for twelve years.
9579	12	3	2	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, but not to the same degree as his father and mother. He did remove the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made.
9580	12	3	3	Yet he persisted in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who encouraged Israel to sin; he did not turn from them.
9581	12	3	4	¶Now King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder. He would send as tribute to the king of Israel 100,000 male lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams.
9582	12	3	5	When Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
9583	12	3	6	At that time King Jehoram left Samaria and assembled all Israel for war.
9584	12	3	7	He sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you fight with me against Moab?” Jehoshaphat replied, “I will join you in the campaign; my army and horses are at your disposal.”
9585	12	3	8	He then asked, “Which invasion route are we going to take?” Jehoram answered, “By the road through the wilderness of Edom.”
9586	12	3	9	So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom set out together. They wandered around on the road for seven days and finally ran out of water for the men and animals they had with them.
9587	12	3	10	The king of Israel said, “Oh no! Certainly the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has summoned these three kings so that he can hand them over to the king of Moab!”
9588	12	3	11	Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> here that we might seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s direction?” One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shapat is here; he used to be Elijah’s servant.”
9589	12	3	12	Jehoshaphat said, “Yes, he receives the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s messages.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to visit him.
9590	12	3	13	¶Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Why are you here? Go to your father’s prophets or your mother’s prophets!” The king of Israel replied to him, “No, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the one who summoned these three kings so that he can hand them over to Moab.”
9591	12	3	14	Elisha said, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies lives (whom I serve), if I did not respect King Jehoshaphat of Judah, I would not pay attention to you or acknowledge you.
9592	12	3	15	But now, get me a musician.” When the musician played, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> energized him,
9593	12	3	16	and he said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘Make many cisterns in this valley,’
9594	12	3	17	for this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘You will not feel any wind or see any rain, but this valley will be full of water and you and your cattle and animals will drink.’
9595	12	3	18	This is an easy task for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; he will also hand Moab over to you.
9596	12	3	19	You will defeat every fortified city and every important city. You must chop down every productive tree, stop up all the springs, and cover all the cultivated land with stones.”
9597	12	3	20	¶Sure enough, the next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water came flowing down from Edom and filled the land.
9598	12	3	21	Now all Moab had heard that the kings were attacking, so everyone old enough to fight was mustered and placed at the border.
9599	12	3	22	When they got up early the next morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites, who were some distance away, the water looked red like blood.
9600	12	3	23	The Moabites said, “It’s blood! The kings must have fought one another! The soldiers have struck one another down! Now, Moab, seize the plunder!”
9601	12	3	24	When they approached the Israelite camp, the Israelites rose up and struck down the Moabites, who then ran from them. The Israelites thoroughly defeated Moab.
9602	12	3	25	They tore down the cities and each man threw a stone into every cultivated field until they were covered. They stopped up every spring and chopped down every productive tree. ¶Only Kir Hareseth was left intact, but the slingers surrounded it and attacked it.
9603	12	3	26	When the king of Moab realized he was losing the battle, he and 700 swordsmen tried to break through and attack the king of Edom, but they failed.
9604	12	3	27	So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice on the wall. There was an outburst of divine anger against Israel, so they broke off the attack and returned to their homeland.
9605	12	4	1	¶Now a wife of one of the prophets appealed to Elisha for help, saying, “Your servant, my husband is dead. You know that your servant was a loyal follower of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Now the creditor is coming to take away my two boys to be his servants.”
9606	12	4	2	Elisha said to her, “What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” She answered, “Your servant has nothing in the house except a small jar of olive oil.”
9607	12	4	3	He said, “Go and ask all your neighbors for empty containers. Get as many as you can.
9608	12	4	4	Go and close the door behind you and your sons. Pour the olive oil into all the containers; set aside each one when you have filled it.”
9609	12	4	5	So she left him and closed the door behind her and her sons. As they were bringing the containers to her, she was pouring the olive oil.
9610	12	4	6	When the containers were full, she said to one of her sons, “Bring me another container.” But he answered her, “There are no more.” Then the olive oil stopped flowing.
9611	12	4	7	She went and told the prophet. He said, “Go, sell the olive oil. Repay your creditor, and then you and your sons can live off the rest of the profit.”
9612	12	4	8	¶One day Elisha traveled to Shunem, where a prominent woman lived. She insisted that he stop for a meal. So whenever he was passing through, he would stop in there for a meal.
9613	12	4	9	She said to her husband, “Look, I’m sure that the man who regularly passes through here is a very special prophet.
9614	12	4	10	Let’s make a small private upper room and furnish it with a bed, table, chair, and lamp. When he visits us, he can stay there.”
9615	12	4	11	¶One day Elisha came for a visit; he went into the upper room and rested.
9616	12	4	12	He told his servant Gehazi, “Ask the Shunammite woman to come here.” So he did so and she came to him.
9617	12	4	13	Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tell her, ‘Look, you have treated us with such great respect. What can I do for you? Can I put in a good word for you with the king or the commander of the army?’” She replied, “I’m quite secure.”
9618	12	4	14	So he asked Gehazi, “What can I do for her?” Gehazi replied, “She has no son, and her husband is old.”
9619	12	4	15	Elisha told him, “Ask her to come here.” So he did so and she came and stood in the doorway.
9620	12	4	16	He said, “About this time next year you will be holding a son.” She said, “No, my master! O prophet, do not lie to your servant!”
9621	12	4	17	The woman did conceive, and at the specified time the next year she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.
9622	12	4	18	¶The boy grew and one day he went out to see his father who was with the harvest workers.
9623	12	4	19	He said to his father, “My head! My head!” His father told a servant, “Carry him to his mother.”
9624	12	4	20	So he picked him up and took him to his mother. He sat on her lap until noon and then died.
9625	12	4	21	She went up and laid him down on the prophet’s bed. She shut the door behind her and left.
9626	12	4	22	She called to her husband, “Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so I can go see the prophet quickly and then return.”
9627	12	4	23	He said, “Why do you want to go see him today? It is not the new moon or the Sabbath.” She said, “Everything’s fine.”
9628	12	4	24	She saddled the donkey and told her servant, “Lead on. Do not stop unless I say so.”
9629	12	4	25	¶So she went to visit the prophet at Mount Carmel. When he saw her at a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, it’s the Shunammite woman.
9630	12	4	26	Now, run to meet her and ask her, ‘Are you well? Are your husband and the boy well?’” She told Gehazi, “Everything’s fine.”
9631	12	4	27	But when she reached the prophet on the mountain, she grabbed hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to push her away, but the prophet said, “Leave her alone, for she is very upset. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has kept the matter hidden from me; he didn’t tell me about it.”
9632	12	4	28	She said, “Did I ask my master for a son? Didn’t I say, ‘Don’t mislead me?’”
9633	12	4	29	Elisha told Gehazi, “Tuck your robes into your belt, take my staff, and go! Don’t stop to exchange greetings with anyone! Place my staff on the child’s face.”
9634	12	4	30	The mother of the child said, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So Elisha got up and followed her back.
9635	12	4	31	¶Now Gehazi went on ahead of them. He placed the staff on the child’s face, but there was no sound or response. When he came back to Elisha he told him, “The child did not wake up.”
9636	12	4	32	When Elisha arrived at the house, there was the child lying dead on his bed.
9637	12	4	33	He went in by himself and closed the door. Then he prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
9638	12	4	34	He got up on the bed and spread his body out over the boy; he put his mouth on the boy’s mouth, his eyes over the boy’s eyes, and the palms of his hands against the boy’s palms. He bent down over him, and the boy’s skin grew warm.
9639	12	4	35	Elisha went back and walked around in the house. Then he got up on the bed again and bent down over him. The child sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
9640	12	4	36	Elisha called to Gehazi and said, “Get the Shunammite woman.” So he did so and she came to him. He said to her, “Take your son.”
9641	12	4	37	She came in, fell at his feet, and bowed down. Then she picked up her son and left.
9642	12	4	38	¶Now Elisha went back to Gilgal, while there was famine in the land. Some of the prophets were visiting him and he told his servant, “Put the big pot on the fire and boil some stew for the prophets.”
9643	12	4	39	Someone went out to the field to gather some herbs and found a wild vine. He picked some of its fruit, enough to fill up the fold of his robe. He came back, cut it up, and threw the slices into the stew pot, not knowing they were harmful.
9644	12	4	40	The stew was poured out for the men to eat. When they ate some of the stew, they cried out, “Death is in the pot, O prophet!” They could not eat it.
9645	12	4	41	He said, “Get some flour.” Then he threw it into the pot and said, “Now pour some out for the men so they may eat.” There was no longer anything harmful in the pot.
9646	12	4	42	¶Now a man from Baal Shalisha brought some food for the prophet – twenty loaves of bread made from the firstfruits of the barley harvest, as well as fresh ears of grain. Elisha said, “Set it before the people so they may eat.”
9647	12	4	43	But his attendant said, “How can I feed a hundred men with this?” He replied, “Set it before the people so they may eat, for this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘They will eat and have some left over.’”
9648	12	4	44	So he set it before them; they ate and had some left over, just as in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s</span> message.
9649	12	5	1	¶Now Naaman, the commander of the king of Syria’s army, was esteemed and respected by his master, for through him the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had given Syria military victories. But this great warrior had a skin disease.
9650	12	5	2	Raiding parties went out from Syria and took captive from the land of Israel a young girl, who became a servant to Naaman’s wife.
9651	12	5	3	She told her mistress, “If only my master were in the presence of the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his skin disease.”
9652	12	5	4	¶Naaman went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said.
9653	12	5	5	The king of Syria said, “Go! I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten suits of clothes.
9654	12	5	6	He brought the letter to the king of Israel. It read: “This is a letter of introduction for my servant Naaman, whom I have sent to be cured of his skin disease.”
9655	12	5	7	When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God? Can I kill or restore life? Why does he ask me to cure a man of his skin disease? Certainly you must see that he is looking for an excuse to fight me!”
9656	12	5	8	¶When Elisha the prophet heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent this message to the king, “Why did you tear your clothes? Send him to me so he may know there is a prophet in Israel.”
9657	12	5	9	So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood in the doorway of Elisha’s house.
9658	12	5	10	Elisha sent out a messenger who told him, “Go and wash seven times in the Jordan; your skin will be restored and you will be healed.”
9659	12	5	11	Naaman went away angry. He said, “Look, I thought for sure he would come out, stand there, invoke the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God, wave his hand over the area, and cure the skin disease.
9660	12	5	12	The rivers of Damascus, the Abana and Pharpar, are better than any of the waters of Israel! Could I not wash in them and be healed?” So he turned around and went away angry.
9661	12	5	13	His servants approached and said to him, “O master, if the prophet had told you to do some difficult task, you would have been willing to do it. It seems you should be happy that he simply said, “Wash and you will be healed.”
9662	12	5	14	So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, as the prophet had instructed. His skin became as smooth as a young child’s and he was healed.
9663	12	5	15	¶He and his entire entourage returned to the prophet. Naaman came and stood before him. He said, “For sure I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel! Now, please accept a gift from your servant.”
9664	12	5	16	But Elisha replied, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives (whom I serve), I will take nothing from you.” Naaman insisted that he take it, but he refused.
9665	12	5	17	Naaman said, “If not, then please give your servant a load of dirt, enough for a pair of mules to carry, for your servant will never again offer a burnt offering or sacrifice to a god other than the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
9666	12	5	18	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to worship, and he leans on my arm and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> forgive your servant for this.”
9667	12	5	19	Elisha said to him, “Go in peace.” ¶When he had gone a short distance,
9668	12	5	20	Gehazi, the prophet Elisha’s servant, thought, “Look, my master did not accept what this Syrian Naaman offered him. As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, I will run after him and accept something from him.”
9669	12	5	21	So Gehazi ran after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?”
9670	12	5	22	He answered, “Everything is fine. My master sent me with this message, ‘Look, two servants of the prophets just arrived from the Ephraimite hill country. Please give them a talent of silver and two suits of clothes.’”
9671	12	5	23	Naaman said, “Please accept two talents of silver.” He insisted, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, along with two suits of clothes. He gave them to two of his servants and they carried them for Gehazi.
9672	12	5	24	When he arrived at the hill, he took them from the servants and put them in the house. Then he sent the men on their way.
9673	12	5	25	¶When he came and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” He answered, “Your servant hasn’t been anywhere.”
9674	12	5	26	Elisha replied, “I was there in spirit when a man turned and got down from his chariot to meet you. This is not the proper time to accept silver or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, sheep, cattle, and male and female servants.
9675	12	5	27	Therefore Naaman’s skin disease will afflict you and your descendants forever!” When Gehazi went out from his presence, his skin was as white as snow.
9676	12	6	1	¶Some of the prophets said to Elisha, “Look, the place where we meet with you is too cramped for us.
9677	12	6	2	Let’s go to the Jordan. Each of us will get a log from there and we will build a meeting place for ourselves there.” He said, “Go.”
9678	12	6	3	One of them said, “Please come along with your servants.” He replied, “All right, I’ll come.”
9679	12	6	4	So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they started cutting down trees.
9680	12	6	5	As one of them was felling a log, the ax head dropped into the water. He shouted, “Oh no, my master! It was borrowed!”
9681	12	6	6	The prophet asked, “Where did it drop in?” When he showed him the spot, Elisha cut off a branch, threw it in at that spot, and made the ax head float.
9682	12	6	7	He said, “Lift it out.” So he reached out his hand and grabbed it.
9683	12	6	8	¶Now the king of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted his advisers, who said, “Invade at such and such a place.”
9684	12	6	9	But the prophet sent this message to the king of Israel, “Make sure you don’t pass through this place because Syria is invading there.”
9685	12	6	10	So the king of Israel sent a message to the place the prophet had pointed out, warning it to be on its guard. This happened on several occasions.
9686	12	6	11	This made the king of Syria upset. So he summoned his advisers and said to them, “One of us must be helping the king of Israel.”
9687	12	6	12	One of his advisers said, “No, my master, O king. The prophet Elisha who lives in Israel keeps telling the king of Israel the things you say in your bedroom.”
9688	12	6	13	The king ordered, “Go, find out where he is, so I can send some men to capture him.” The king was told, “He is in Dothan.”
9689	12	6	14	So he sent horses and chariots there, along with a good-sized army. They arrived during the night and surrounded the city.
9690	12	6	15	¶The prophet’s attendant got up early in the morning. When he went outside there was an army surrounding the city, along with horses and chariots. He said to Elisha, “Oh no, my master! What will we do?”
9691	12	6	16	He replied, “Don’t be afraid, for our side outnumbers them.”
9692	12	6	17	Then Elisha prayed, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, open his eyes so he can see.” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> opened the servant’s eyes and he saw that the hill was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
9693	12	6	18	As they approached him, Elisha prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Strike these people with blindness.” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> struck them with blindness as Elisha requested.
9694	12	6	19	Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the right road or city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you’re looking for.” He led them to Samaria.
9695	12	6	20	¶When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, open their eyes, so they can see.” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> opened their eyes and they saw that they were in the middle of Samaria.
9696	12	6	21	When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “Should I strike them down, my master?”
9697	12	6	22	He replied, “Do not strike them down! You did not capture them with your sword or bow, so what gives you the right to strike them down? Give them some food and water, so they can eat and drink and then go back to their master.”
9698	12	6	23	So he threw a big banquet for them and they ate and drank. Then he sent them back to their master. After that no Syrian raiding parties again invaded the land of Israel.
9699	12	6	24	¶Later King Ben Hadad of Syria assembled his entire army and attacked and besieged Samaria.
9700	12	6	25	Samaria’s food supply ran out. They laid siege to it so long that a donkey’s head was selling for eighty shekels of silver and a quarter of a kab of dove’s droppings for five shekels of silver.
9701	12	6	26	¶While the king of Israel was passing by on the city wall, a woman shouted to him, “Help us, my master, O king!”
9702	12	6	27	He replied, “No, let the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> help you. How can I help you? The threshing floor and winepress are empty.”
9703	12	6	28	Then the king asked her, “What’s your problem?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Hand over your son; we’ll eat him today and then eat my son tomorrow.’
9704	12	6	29	So we boiled my son and ate him. Then I said to her the next day, ‘Hand over your son and we’ll eat him.’ But she hid her son!”
9705	12	6	30	When the king heard what the woman said, he tore his clothes. As he was passing by on the wall, the people could see he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes.
9706	12	6	31	Then he said, “May God judge me severely if Elisha son of Shaphat still has his head by the end of the day!”
9707	12	6	32	¶Now Elisha was sitting in his house with the community leaders. The king sent a messenger on ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the leaders, “Do you realize this assassin intends to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger arrives, shut the door and lean against it. His master will certainly be right behind him.”
9708	12	6	33	He was still talking to them when the messenger approached and said, “Look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is responsible for this disaster! Why should I continue to wait for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to help?”
9709	12	7	1	Elisha replied, “Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message. This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘About this time tomorrow a seah of finely milled flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.’”
9710	12	7	2	An officer who was the king’s right-hand man responded to the prophet, “Look, even if the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made it rain by opening holes in the sky, could this happen so soon?” Elisha said, “Look, you will see it happen with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of the food!”
9711	12	7	3	¶Now four men with a skin disease were sitting at the entrance of the city gate. They said to one another, “Why are we just sitting here waiting to die?
9712	12	7	4	If we go into the city, we’ll die of starvation, and if we stay here we’ll die! So come on, let’s defect to the Syrian camp! If they spare us, we’ll live; if they kill us – well, we were going to die anyway.”
9713	12	7	5	So they started toward the Syrian camp at dusk. When they reached the edge of the Syrian camp, there was no one there.
9714	12	7	6	The Lord had caused the Syrian camp to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a large army. Then they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has paid the kings of the Hittites and Egypt to attack us!”
9715	12	7	7	So they got up and fled at dusk, leaving behind their tents, horses, and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.
9716	12	7	8	When the men with a skin disease reached the edge of the camp, they entered a tent and had a meal. They also took some silver, gold, and clothes and went and hid it all. Then they went back and entered another tent. They looted it and went and hid what they had taken.
9717	12	7	9	Then they said to one another, “It’s not right what we’re doing! This is a day to celebrate, but we haven’t told anyone. If we wait until dawn, we’ll be punished. So come on, let’s go and inform the royal palace.”
9718	12	7	10	So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city. They told them, “We entered the Syrian camp and there was no one there. We didn’t even hear a man’s voice. But the horses and donkeys are still tied up, and the tents remain up.”
9719	12	7	11	The gatekeepers relayed the news to the royal palace.
9720	12	7	12	¶The king got up in the night and said to his advisers, “I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know we are starving, so they left the camp and hid in the field, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and enter the city.’”
9721	12	7	13	One of his advisers replied, “Pick some men and have them take five of the horses that are left in the city. (Even if they are killed, their fate will be no different than that of all the Israelite people – we’re all going to die!) Let’s send them out so we can know for sure what’s going on.”
9722	12	7	14	So they picked two horsemen and the king sent them out to track the Syrian army. He ordered them, “Go and find out what’s going on.”
9723	12	7	15	So they tracked them as far as the Jordan. The road was filled with clothes and equipment that the Syrians had discarded in their haste. The scouts went back and told the king.
9724	12	7	16	Then the people went out and looted the Syrian camp. A seah of finely milled flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, just as in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message.
9725	12	7	17	¶Now the king had placed the officer who was his right-hand man at the city gate. When the people rushed out, they trampled him to death in the gate. This fulfilled the prophet’s word which he had spoken when the king tried to arrest him.
9726	12	7	18	The prophet told the king, “Two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel, and a seah of finely milled flour for a shekel; this will happen about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria.”
9727	12	7	19	But the officer replied to the prophet, “Look, even if the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made it rain by opening holes in the sky, could this happen so soon?” Elisha said, “Look, you will see it happen with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of the food!”
9728	12	7	20	This is exactly what happened to him. The people trampled him to death in the city gate.
9729	12	8	1	¶Now Elisha advised the woman whose son he had brought back to life, “You and your family should go and live somewhere else for a while, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has decreed that a famine will overtake the land for seven years.”
9730	12	8	2	So the woman did as the prophet said. She and her family went and lived in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
9731	12	8	3	After seven years the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went to ask the king to give her back her house and field.
9732	12	8	4	Now the king was talking to Gehazi, the prophet’s servant, and said, “Tell me all the great things which Elisha has done.”
9733	12	8	5	While Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought the dead back to life, the woman whose son he had brought back to life came to ask the king for her house and field. Gehazi said, “My master, O king, this is the very woman and this is her son whom Elisha brought back to life!”
9734	12	8	6	The king asked the woman about it, and she gave him the details. The king assigned a eunuch to take care of her request and ordered him, “Give her back everything she owns, as well as the amount of crops her field produced from the day she left the land until now.”
9735	12	8	7	¶Elisha traveled to Damascus while King Ben Hadad of Syria was sick. The king was told, “The prophet has come here.”
9736	12	8	8	So the king told Hazael, “Take a gift and go visit the prophet. Request from him an oracle from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Ask him, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”
9737	12	8	9	So Hazael went to visit Elisha. He took along a gift, as well as forty camel loads of all the fine things of Damascus. When he arrived, he stood before him and said, “Your son, King Ben Hadad of Syria, has sent me to you with this question, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”
9738	12	8	10	Elisha said to him, “Go and tell him, ‘You will surely recover,’ but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has revealed to me that he will surely die.”
9739	12	8	11	Elisha just stared at him until Hazael became uncomfortable. Then the prophet started crying.
9740	12	8	12	Hazael asked, “Why are you crying, my master?” He replied, “Because I know the trouble you will cause the Israelites. You will set fire to their fortresses, kill their young men with the sword, smash their children to bits, and rip open their pregnant women.”
9741	12	8	13	Hazael said, “How could your servant, who is as insignificant as a dog, accomplish this great military victory?” Elisha answered, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has revealed to me that you will be the king of Syria.”
9742	12	8	14	He left Elisha and went to his master. Ben Hadad asked him, “What did Elisha tell you?” Hazael replied, “He told me you would surely recover.”
9743	12	8	15	The next day Hazael took a piece of cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it over Ben Hadad’s face until he died. Then Hazael replaced him as king.
9744	12	8	16	¶In the fifth year of the reign of Israel’s King Joram, son of Ahab, Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram became king over Judah.
9745	12	8	17	He was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
9746	12	8	18	He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel, just as Ahab’s dynasty had done, for he married Ahab’s daughter. He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
9747	12	8	19	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was unwilling to destroy Judah. He preserved Judah for the sake of his servant David to whom he had promised a perpetual dynasty.
9748	12	8	20	¶During his reign Edom freed themselves from Judah’s control and set up their own king.
9749	12	8	21	Joram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites, who had surrounded him, attacked at night and defeated him and his chariot officers. The Israelite army retreated to their homeland.
9750	12	8	22	So Edom has remained free from Judah’s control to this very day. At that same time Libnah also rebelled.
9751	12	8	23	¶The rest of the events of Joram’s reign, including a record of his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
9752	12	8	24	Joram passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Ahaziah replaced him as king.
9753	12	8	25	¶In the twelfth year of the reign of Israel’s King Joram, son of Ahab, Jehoram’s son Ahaziah became king over Judah.
9754	12	8	26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel.
9755	12	8	27	He followed in the footsteps of Ahab’s dynasty and did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, like Ahab’s dynasty, for he was related to Ahab’s family.
9756	12	8	28	¶He joined Ahab’s son Joram in a battle against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth Gilead in which the Syrians defeated Joram.
9757	12	8	29	King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians in Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Syria. King Ahaziah son of Jehoram of Judah went down to visit Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he was ill.
9758	12	9	1	¶Now Elisha the prophet summoned a member of the prophetic guild and told him, “Tuck your robes into your belt, take this container of olive oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.
9759	12	9	2	When you arrive there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi and take him aside into an inner room.
9760	12	9	3	Take the container of olive oil, pour it over his head, and say, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, “I have designated you as king over Israel.”’ Then open the door and run away quickly!”
9761	12	9	4	¶So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead.
9762	12	9	5	When he arrived, the officers of the army were sitting there. So he said, “I have a message for you, O officer.” Jehu asked, “For which one of us?” He replied, “For you, O officer.”
9763	12	9	6	So Jehu got up and went inside. Then the prophet poured the olive oil on his head and said to him, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said, ‘I have designated you as king over the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s people Israel.
9764	12	9	7	You will destroy the family of your master Ahab. I will get revenge against Jezebel for the shed blood of my servants the prophets and for the shed blood of all the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servants.
9765	12	9	8	Ahab’s entire family will die. I will cut off every last male belonging to Ahab in Israel, including even the weak and incapacitated.
9766	12	9	9	I will make Ahab’s dynasty like those of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah.
9767	12	9	10	Dogs will devour Jezebel on the plot of ground in Jezreel; she will not be buried.’” Then he opened the door and ran away.
9768	12	9	11	¶When Jehu rejoined his master’s servants, they asked him, “Is everything all right? Why did this madman visit you?” He replied, “Ah, it’s not important. You know what kind of man he is and the kinds of things he says.”
9769	12	9	12	But they said, “You’re lying! Tell us what he said.” So he told them what he had said. He also related how he had said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘I have designated you as king over Israel.’”
9770	12	9	13	Each of them quickly took off his cloak and they spread them out at Jehu’s feet on the steps. The trumpet was blown and they shouted, “Jehu is king!”
9771	12	9	14	Then Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi conspired against Joram.¶Now Joram had been in Ramoth Gilead with the whole Israelite army, guarding against an invasion by King Hazael of Syria.
9772	12	9	15	But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians when he fought against King Hazael of Syria. Jehu told his supporters, “If you really want me to be king, then don’t let anyone escape from the city to go and warn Jezreel.”
9773	12	9	16	Jehu drove his chariot to Jezreel, for Joram was recuperating there. (Now King Ahaziah of Judah had come down to visit Joram.)
9774	12	9	17	¶Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and saw Jehu’s troops approaching. He said, “I see troops!” Jehoram ordered, “Send a rider out to meet them and have him ask, ‘Is everything all right?’”
9775	12	9	18	So the horseman went to meet him and said, “This is what the king says, ‘Is everything all right?’” Jehu replied, “None of your business! Follow me.” The watchman reported, “The messenger reached them, but hasn’t started back.”
9776	12	9	19	So he sent a second horseman out to them and he said, “This is what the king says, ‘Is everything all right?’” Jehu replied, “None of your business! Follow me.”
9777	12	9	20	The watchman reported, “He reached them, but hasn’t started back. The one who drives the lead chariot drives like Jehu son of Nimshi; he drives recklessly.”
9778	12	9	21	Jehoram ordered, “Hitch up my chariot.” When his chariot had been hitched up, King Jehoram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah went out in their respective chariots to meet Jehu. They met up with him in the plot of land that had once belonged to Naboth of Jezreel.
9779	12	9	22	¶When Jehoram saw Jehu, he asked, “Is everything all right, Jehu?” He replied, “How can everything be all right as long as your mother Jezebel promotes idolatry and pagan practices?”
9780	12	9	23	Jehoram turned his chariot around and took off. He said to Ahaziah, “It’s a trap, Ahaziah!”
9781	12	9	24	Jehu aimed his bow and shot an arrow right between Jehoram’s shoulders. The arrow went through his heart and he fell to his knees in his chariot.
9782	12	9	25	Jehu ordered his officer Bidkar, “Pick him up and throw him into the part of the field that once belonged to Naboth of Jezreel. Remember, you and I were riding together behind his father Ahab, when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> pronounced this oracle against him,
9783	12	9	26	‘“Know for sure that I saw the shed blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “and that I will give you what you deserve right here in this plot of land,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’So now pick him up and throw him into this plot of land, just as in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message.”
9784	12	9	27	¶When King Ahaziah of Judah saw what happened, he took off up the road to Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him and ordered, “Shoot him too.” They shot him while he was driving his chariot up the ascent of Gur near Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo and died there.
9785	12	9	28	His servants took his body back to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.
9786	12	9	29	Ahaziah had become king over Judah in the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab.
9787	12	9	30	¶Jehu approached Jezreel. When Jezebel heard the news, she put on some eye liner, fixed up her hair, and leaned out the window.
9788	12	9	31	When Jehu came through the gate, she said, “Is everything all right, Zimri, murderer of his master?”
9789	12	9	32	He looked up at the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
9790	12	9	33	He said, “Throw her down!” So they threw her down, and when she hit the ground, her blood splattered against the wall and the horses, and Jehu drove his chariot over her.
9791	12	9	34	He went inside and had a meal. Then he said, “Dispose of this accursed woman’s corpse. Bury her, for after all, she was a king’s daughter.”
9792	12	9	35	But when they went to bury her, they found nothing left but the skull, feet, and palms of the hands.
9793	12	9	36	So they went back and told him. Then he said, “It is the fulfillment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message that he had spoken through his servant, Elijah the Tishbite, ‘In the plot of land at Jezreel, dogs will devour Jezebel’s flesh.
9794	12	9	37	Jezebel’s corpse will be like manure on the surface of the ground in the plot of land at Jezreel. People will not be able to even recognize her.’”
9795	12	10	1	¶Ahab had seventy sons living in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the leading officials of Jezreel and to the guardians of Ahab’s dynasty. This is what the letters said,
9796	12	10	2	“You have with you the sons of your master, chariots and horses, a fortified city, and weapons. So when this letter arrives,
9797	12	10	3	pick the best and most capable of your master’s sons, place him on his father’s throne, and defend your master’s dynasty.”
9798	12	10	4	¶They were absolutely terrified and said, “Look, two kings could not stop him! How can we?”
9799	12	10	5	So the palace supervisor, the city commissioner, the leaders, and the guardians sent this message to Jehu, “We are your subjects! Whatever you say, we will do. We will not make anyone king. Do what you consider proper.”
9800	12	10	6	¶He wrote them a second letter, saying, “If you are really on my side and are willing to obey me, then take the heads of your master’s sons and come to me in Jezreel at this time tomorrow.” Now the king had seventy sons, and the prominent men of the city were raising them.
9801	12	10	7	When they received the letter, they seized the king’s sons and executed all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to him in Jezreel.
9802	12	10	8	The messenger came and told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.” Jehu said, “Stack them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning.”
9803	12	10	9	In the morning he went out and stood there. Then he said to all the people, “You are innocent. I conspired against my master and killed him. But who struck down all of these men?
9804	12	10	10	Therefore take note that not one of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s words which he pronounced against Ahab’s dynasty will fail to materialize. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has done what he announced through his servant Elijah.”
9805	12	10	11	Then Jehu killed all who were left of Ahab’s family in Jezreel, and all his nobles, close friends, and priests. He left no survivors.
9806	12	10	12	¶Jehu then left there and set out for Samaria. While he was traveling through Beth Eked of the Shepherds,
9807	12	10	13	Jehu encountered the relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah. He asked, “Who are you?” They replied, “We are Ahaziah’s relatives. We have come down to see how the king’s sons and the queen mother’s sons are doing.”
9808	12	10	14	He said, “Capture them alive!” So they captured them alive and then executed all forty-two of them in the cistern at Beth Eked. He left no survivors.
9809	12	10	15	¶When he left there, he met Jehonadab, son of Rekab, who had been looking for him. Jehu greeted him and asked, “Are you as committed to me as I am to you?” Jehonadab answered, “I am!” Jehu replied, “If so, give me your hand.” So he offered his hand and Jehu pulled him up into the chariot.
9810	12	10	16	Jehu said, “Come with me and see how zealous I am for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s cause.” So he took him along in his chariot.
9811	12	10	17	He went to Samaria and killed each of Ahab’s remaining family members who were in Samaria until he destroyed them, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message which he had announced to Elijah.
9812	12	10	18	¶Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, “Ahab worshiped Baal a little; Jehu will worship him with great devotion.
9813	12	10	19	So now, bring to me all the prophets of Baal, as well as all his servants and priests. None of them must be absent, for I am offering a great sacrifice to Baal. Any of them who fail to appear will lose their lives.” But Jehu was tricking them so he could destroy the servants of Baal.
9814	12	10	20	Then Jehu ordered, “Make arrangements for a celebration for Baal.” So they announced it.
9815	12	10	21	Jehu sent invitations throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one was absent. They arrived at the temple of Baal and filled it up from end to end.
9816	12	10	22	Jehu ordered the one who was in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out robes for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out robes for them.
9817	12	10	23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went to the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Make sure there are no servants of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> here with you; there must be only servants of Baal.”
9818	12	10	24	They went inside to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside. He had told them, “If any of the men inside get away, you will pay with your lives!”
9819	12	10	25	¶When he finished offering the burnt sacrifice, Jehu ordered the royal guard and officers, “Come in and strike them down! Don’t let any escape!” So the royal guard and officers struck them down with the sword and left their bodies lying there. Then they entered the inner sanctuary of the temple of Baal.
9820	12	10	26	They hauled out the sacred pillar of the temple of Baal and burned it.
9821	12	10	27	They demolished the sacred pillar of Baal and the temple of Baal; it is used as a latrine to this very day.
9822	12	10	28	So Jehu eradicated Baal worship from Israel.
9823	12	10	29	¶However, Jehu did not repudiate the sins which Jeroboam son of Nebat had encouraged Israel to commit; the golden calves remained in Bethel and Dan.
9824	12	10	30	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Jehu, “You have done well. You have accomplished my will and carried out my wishes with regard to Ahab’s dynasty. Therefore four generations of your descendants will rule over Israel.”
9825	12	10	31	But Jehu did not carefully and wholeheartedly obey the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel. He did not repudiate the sins which Jeroboam had encouraged Israel to commit.
9826	12	10	32	¶In those days the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> began to reduce the size of Israel’s territory. Hazael attacked their eastern border.
9827	12	10	33	He conquered all the land of Gilead, including the territory of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, extending all the way from the Aroer in the Arnon Valley through Gilead to Bashan.
9828	12	10	34	¶The rest of the events of Jehu’s reign, including all his accomplishments and successes, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9829	12	10	35	Jehu passed away and was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz replaced him as king.
9830	12	10	36	Jehu reigned over Israel for twenty-eight years in Samaria.
9831	12	11	1	¶When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she was determined to destroy the entire royal line.
9832	12	11	2	So Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah, took Ahaziah’s son Joash and stole him away from the rest of the royal descendants who were to be executed. She hid him and his nurse in the room where the bed covers were stored. So he was hidden from Athaliah and escaped execution.
9833	12	11	3	He hid out with his nurse in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple for six years, while Athaliah was ruling over the land.
9834	12	11	4	¶In the seventh year Jehoiada summoned the officers of the units of hundreds of the Carians and the royal bodyguard. He met with them in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. He made an agreement with them and made them swear an oath of allegiance in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. Then he showed them the king’s son.
9835	12	11	5	He ordered them, “This is what you must do. One third of the unit that is on duty during the Sabbath will guard the royal palace.
9836	12	11	6	Another third of you will be stationed at the Foundation Gate. Still another third of you will be stationed at the gate behind the royal guard. You will take turns guarding the palace.
9837	12	11	7	The two units who are off duty on the Sabbath will guard the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and protect the king.
9838	12	11	8	You must surround the king. Each of you must hold his weapon in his hand. Whoever approaches your ranks must be killed. You must accompany the king wherever he goes.”
9839	12	11	9	¶The officers of the units of hundreds did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each of them took his men, those who were on duty during the Sabbath as well as those who were off duty on the Sabbath, and reported to Jehoiada the priest.
9840	12	11	10	The priest gave to the officers of the units of hundreds King David’s spears and the shields that were kept in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
9841	12	11	11	The royal bodyguard took their stations, each holding his weapon in his hand. They lined up from the south side of the temple to the north side and stood near the altar and the temple, surrounding the king.
9842	12	11	12	Jehoiada led out the king’s son and placed on him the crown and the royal insignia. They proclaimed him king and poured olive oil on his head. They clapped their hands and cried out, “Long live the king!”
9843	12	11	13	¶When Athaliah heard the royal guard shout, she joined the crowd at the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
9844	12	11	14	Then she saw the king standing by the pillar, according to custom. The officers stood beside the king with their trumpets and all the people of the land were celebrating and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed, “Treason, treason!”
9845	12	11	15	Jehoiada the priest ordered the officers of the units of hundreds, who were in charge of the army, “Bring her outside the temple to the guards. Put the sword to anyone who follows her.” The priest gave this order because he had decided she should not be executed in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
9846	12	11	16	They seized her and took her into the precincts of the royal palace through the horses’ entrance. There she was executed.
9847	12	11	17	¶Jehoiada then drew up a covenant between the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and the king and people, stipulating that they should be loyal to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
9848	12	11	18	All the people of the land went and demolished the temple of Baal. They smashed its altars and idols to bits. They killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altar. Jehoiada the priest then placed guards at the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
9849	12	11	19	He took the officers of the units of hundreds, the Carians, the royal bodyguard, and all the people of the land, and together they led the king down from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. They entered the royal palace through the Gate of the Royal Bodyguard, and the king sat down on the royal throne.
9850	12	11	20	All the people of the land celebrated, for the city had rest now that they had killed Athaliah with the sword in the royal palace.
9851	12	11	21	¶(12:1) Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
9852	12	12	1	(12:2) In Jehu’s seventh year Jehoash became king; he reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah, who was from Beer Sheba.
9853	12	12	2	Jehoash did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved all his days when Jehoiada the priest taught him.
9854	12	12	3	But the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places.
9855	12	12	4	¶Jehoash said to the priests, “I place at your disposal all the consecrated silver that has been brought to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, including the silver collected from the census tax, the silver received from those who have made vows, and all the silver that people have voluntarily contributed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
9856	12	12	5	The priests should receive the silver they need from the treasurers and repair any damage to the temple they discover.”
9857	12	12	6	¶By the twenty-third year of King Jehoash’s reign the priests had still not repaired the damage to the temple.
9858	12	12	7	So King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest along with the other priests, and said to them, “Why have you not repaired the damage to the temple? Now, take no more silver from your treasurers unless you intend to use it to repair the damage.”
9859	12	12	8	The priests agreed not to collect silver from the people and relieved themselves of personal responsibility for the temple repairs.
9860	12	12	9	¶Jehoiada the priest took a chest and drilled a hole in its lid. He placed it on the right side of the altar near the entrance of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. The priests who guarded the entrance would put into it all the silver brought to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
9861	12	12	10	When they saw the chest was full of silver, the royal secretary and the high priest counted the silver that had been brought to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and bagged it up.
9862	12	12	11	They would then hand over the silver that had been weighed to the construction foremen assigned to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. They hired carpenters and builders to work on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple,
9863	12	12	12	as well as masons and stonecutters. They bought wood and chiseled stone to repair the damage to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and also paid for all the other expenses.
9864	12	12	13	The silver brought to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple was not used for silver bowls, trimming shears, basins, trumpets, or any kind of gold or silver implements.
9865	12	12	14	It was handed over to the foremen who used it to repair the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
9866	12	12	15	They did not audit the treasurers who disbursed the funds to the foremen, for they were honest.
9867	12	12	16	(The silver collected in conjunction with reparation offerings and sin offerings was not brought to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple; it belonged to the priests.)
9868	12	12	17	¶At that time King Hazael of Syria attacked Gath and captured it. Hazael then decided to attack Jerusalem.
9869	12	12	18	King Jehoash of Judah collected all the sacred items that his ancestors Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, kings of Judah, had consecrated, as well as his own sacred items and all the gold that could be found in the treasuries of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and the royal palace. He sent it all to King Hazael of Syria, who then withdrew from Jerusalem.
9870	12	12	19	¶The rest of the events of Joash’s reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
9871	12	12	20	His servants conspired against him and murdered Joash at Beth-Millo, on the road that goes down to Silla.
9872	12	12	21	His servants Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer murdered him. He was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Amaziah replaced him as king.
9873	12	13	1	¶In the twenty-third year of the reign of Judah’s King Joash son of Ahaziah, Jehu’s son Jehoahaz became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria for seventeen years.
9874	12	13	2	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He continued in the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat who had encouraged Israel to sin; he did not repudiate those sins.
9875	12	13	3	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was furious with Israel and handed them over to King Hazael of Syria and to Hazael’s son Ben Hadad for many years.
9876	12	13	4	¶Jehoahaz asked for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s mercy and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responded favorably, for he saw that Israel was oppressed by the king of Syria.
9877	12	13	5	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> provided a deliverer for Israel and they were freed from Syria’s power. The Israelites once more lived in security.
9878	12	13	6	But they did not repudiate the sinful ways of the family of Jeroboam, who encouraged Israel to sin; they continued in those sins. There was even an Asherah pole standing in Samaria.
9879	12	13	7	Jehoahaz had no army left except for fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and 10,000 foot soldiers. The king of Syria had destroyed his troops and trampled on them like dust.
9880	12	13	8	¶The rest of the events of Jehoahaz’s reign, including all his accomplishments and successes, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9881	12	13	9	Jehoahaz passed away and was buried in Samaria. His son Joash replaced him as king.
9882	12	13	10	¶In the thirty-seventh year of King Joash’s reign over Judah, Jehoahaz’s son Jehoash became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria for sixteen years.
9883	12	13	11	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He did not repudiate the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat who encouraged Israel to sin; he continued in those sins.
9884	12	13	12	The rest of the events of Joash’s reign, including all his accomplishments and his successful war with King Amaziah of Judah, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9885	12	13	13	Joash passed away and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
9886	12	13	14	¶Now Elisha had a terminal illness. King Joash of Israel went down to visit him. He wept before him and said, “My father, my father! The chariot and horsemen of Israel!”
9887	12	13	15	Elisha told him, “Take a bow and some arrows,” and he did so.
9888	12	13	16	Then Elisha told the king of Israel, “Aim the bow.” He did so, and Elisha placed his hands on the king’s hands.
9889	12	13	17	Elisha said, “Open the east window,” and he did so. Elisha said, “Shoot!” and ¶he did so. Elisha said, “This arrow symbolizes the victory the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will give you over Syria. You will annihilate Syria in Aphek!”
9890	12	13	18	Then Elisha said, “Take the arrows,” and he did so. He told the king of Israel, “Strike the ground!” He struck the ground three times and stopped.
9891	12	13	19	The prophet got angry at him and said, “If you had struck the ground five or six times, you would have annihilated Syria! But now, you will defeat Syria only three times.”
9892	12	13	20	¶Elisha died and was buried. Moabite raiding parties invaded the land at the beginning of the year.
9893	12	13	21	One day some men were burying a man when they spotted a raiding party. So they threw the dead man into Elisha’s tomb. When the body touched Elisha’s bones, the dead man came to life and stood on his feet.
9894	12	13	22	¶Now King Hazael of Syria oppressed Israel throughout Jehoahaz’s reign.
9895	12	13	23	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had mercy on them and felt pity for them. He extended his favor to them because of the promise he had made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He has been unwilling to destroy them or remove them from his presence to this very day.
9896	12	13	24	When King Hazael of Syria died, his son Ben Hadad replaced him as king.
9897	12	13	25	Jehoahaz’s son Jehoash took back from Ben Hadad son of Hazael the cities that he had taken from his father Jehoahaz in war. Joash defeated him three times and recovered the Israelite cities.
9898	12	14	1	¶In the second year of the reign of Israel’s King Joash son of Joahaz, Joash’s son Amaziah became king over Judah.
9899	12	14	2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddan, who was from Jerusalem.
9900	12	14	3	He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved, but not like David his father. He followed the example of his father Joash.
9901	12	14	4	But the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places.
9902	12	14	5	¶When he had secured control of the kingdom, he executed the servants who had assassinated his father.
9903	12	14	6	But he did not execute the sons of the assassins. He obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commandment as recorded in the law scroll of Moses, “Fathers must not be put to death for what their sons do, and sons must not be put to death for what their fathers do. A man must be put to death only for his own sin.”
9904	12	14	7	¶He defeated 10,000 Edomites in the Salt Valley; he captured Sela in battle and renamed it Joktheel, a name it has retained to this very day.
9905	12	14	8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel. He said, “Come, let’s meet face to face.”
9906	12	14	9	King Jehoash of Israel sent this message back to King Amaziah of Judah, “A thornbush in Lebanon sent this message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son as a wife.’ Then a wild animal of Lebanon came by and trampled down the thorn.
9907	12	14	10	You thoroughly defeated Edom and it has gone to your head! Gloat over your success, but stay in your palace. Why bring calamity on yourself? Why bring down yourself and Judah along with you?”
9908	12	14	11	But Amaziah would not heed the warning, so King Jehoash of Israel attacked. He and King Amaziah of Judah met face to face in Beth Shemesh of Judah.
9909	12	14	12	Judah was defeated by Israel, and each man ran back home.
9910	12	14	13	King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, son of Jehoash son of Ahaziah, in Beth Shemesh. He attacked Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate – a distance of about six hundred feet.
9911	12	14	14	He took away all the gold and silver, all the items found in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and in the treasuries of the royal palace, and some hostages. Then he went back to Samaria.
9912	12	14	15	¶The rest of the events of Jehoash’s reign, including all his accomplishments and his successful war with King Amaziah of Judah, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9913	12	14	16	Jehoash passed away and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. His son Jeroboam replaced him as king.)
9914	12	14	17	¶King Amaziah son of Joash of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of King Jehoash son of Jehoahaz of Israel.
9915	12	14	18	The rest of the events of Amaziah’s reign are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
9916	12	14	19	Conspirators plotted against him in Jerusalem, so he fled to Lachish. But they sent assassins after him and they killed him there.
9917	12	14	20	His body was carried back by horses and he was buried in Jerusalem with his ancestors in the City of David.
9918	12	14	21	All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in his father Amaziah’s place.
9919	12	14	22	Azariah built up Elat and restored it to Judah after the king had passed away.
9920	12	14	23	¶In the fifteenth year of the reign of Judah’s King Amaziah, son of Joash, Jeroboam son of Joash became king over Israel. He reigned for forty-one years in Samaria.
9921	12	14	24	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; he did not repudiate the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat who encouraged Israel to sin.
9922	12	14	25	He restored the border of Israel from Lebo Hamath in the north to the sea of the rift valley in the south, just as in the message from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel that he had announced through his servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath Hepher.
9923	12	14	26	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> saw Israel’s intense suffering; everyone was weak and incapacitated and Israel had no deliverer.
9924	12	14	27	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had not decreed that he would blot out Israel’s memory from under heaven, so he delivered them through Jeroboam son of Joash.
9925	12	14	28	¶The rest of the events of Jeroboam’s reign, including all his accomplishments, his military success in restoring Israelite control over Damascus and Hamath, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9926	12	14	29	Jeroboam passed away and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. His son Zechariah replaced him as king.
9927	12	15	1	¶In the twenty-seventh year of King Jeroboam’s reign over Israel, Amaziah’s son Azariah became king over Judah.
9928	12	15	2	He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah, who was from Jerusalem.
9929	12	15	3	He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved, just as his father Amaziah had done.
9930	12	15	4	But the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places.
9931	12	15	5	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> afflicted the king with an illness; he suffered from a skin disease until the day he died. He lived in separate quarters, while his son Jotham was in charge of the palace and ruled over the people of the land.
9932	12	15	6	¶The rest of the events of Azariah’s reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
9933	12	15	7	Azariah passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Jotham replaced him as king.
9934	12	15	8	¶In the thirty-eighth year of King Azariah’s reign over Judah, Jeroboam’s son Zechariah became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria for six months.
9935	12	15	9	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, as his ancestors had done. He did not repudiate the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat who encouraged Israel to sin.
9936	12	15	10	Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against him; he assassinated him in Ibleam and took his place as king.
9937	12	15	11	The rest of the events of Zechariah’s reign are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9938	12	15	12	His assassination fulfilled the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message to Jehu, “Four generations of your descendants will rule on Israel’s throne.” And that is how it happened.
9939	12	15	13	¶Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of King Uzziah’s reign over Judah. He reigned for one month in Samaria.
9940	12	15	14	Menahem son of Gadi went up from Tirzah to Samaria and attacked Shallum son of Jabesh. He killed him and took his place as king.
9941	12	15	15	The rest of the events of Shallum’s reign, including the conspiracy he organized, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9942	12	15	16	At that time Menahem came from Tirzah and attacked Tiphsah. He struck down all who lived in the city and the surrounding territory, because they would not surrender. He even ripped open the pregnant women.
9943	12	15	17	¶In the thirty-ninth year of King Azariah’s reign over Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king over Israel. He reigned for ten years in Samaria.
9944	12	15	18	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; he did not repudiate the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat who encouraged Israel to sin. ¶During his reign,
9945	12	15	19	Pul king of Assyria invaded the land, and Menahem paid him a thousand talents of silver to gain his support and to solidify his control of the kingdom.
9946	12	15	20	Menahem got this silver by taxing all the wealthy men in Israel; he took fifty shekels of silver from each one of them and paid it to the king of Assyria. Then the king of Assyria left; he did not stay there in the land.
9947	12	15	21	¶The rest of the events of Menahem’s reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9948	12	15	22	Menahem passed away and his son Pekahiah replaced him as king.
9949	12	15	23	¶In the fiftieth year of King Azariah’s reign over Judah, Menahem’s son Pekahiah became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria for two years.
9950	12	15	24	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; he did not repudiate the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat who encouraged Israel to sin.
9951	12	15	25	His officer Pekah son of Remaliah conspired against him. He and fifty Gileadites assassinated Pekahiah, as well as Argob and Arieh, in Samaria in the fortress of the royal palace. Pekah then took his place as king.
9952	12	15	26	¶The rest of the events of Pekahiah’s reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9953	12	15	27	¶In the fifty-second year of King Azariah’s reign over Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria for twenty years.
9954	12	15	28	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; he did not repudiate the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat who encouraged Israel to sin.
9955	12	15	29	During Pekah’s reign over Israel, King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, including all the territory of Naphtali. He deported the people to Assyria.
9956	12	15	30	Hoshea son of Elah conspired against Pekah son of Remaliah. He assassinated him and took his place as king, in the twentieth year of the reign of Jotham son of Uzziah.
9957	12	15	31	¶The rest of the events of Pekah’s reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
9958	12	15	32	¶In the second year of the reign of Israel’s King Pekah son of Remaliah, Uzziah’s son Jotham became king over Judah.
9959	12	15	33	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
9960	12	15	34	He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved, just as his father Uzziah had done.
9961	12	15	35	But the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places. He built the Upper Gate to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
9962	12	15	36	¶The rest of the events of Jotham’s reign, including his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
9963	12	15	37	In those days the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> prompted King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah to attack Judah.
9964	12	15	38	Jotham passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the city of his ancestor David. His son Ahaz replaced him as king.
9965	12	16	1	¶In the seventeenth year of the reign of Pekah son of Remaliah, Jotham’s son Ahaz became king over Judah.
9966	12	16	2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what pleased the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God, in contrast to his ancestor David.
9967	12	16	3	He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel. He passed his son through the fire, a horrible sin practiced by the nations whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> drove out from before the Israelites.
9968	12	16	4	He offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
9969	12	16	5	¶At that time King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel attacked Jerusalem. They besieged Ahaz, but were unable to conquer him.
9970	12	16	6	(At that time King Rezin of Syria recovered Elat for Syria; he drove the Judahites from there. Syrians arrived in Elat and live there to this very day.)
9971	12	16	7	Ahaz sent messengers to King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your dependent. March up and rescue me from the power of the king of Syria and the king of Israel, who have attacked me.”
9972	12	16	8	Then Ahaz took the silver and gold that were in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and in the treasuries of the royal palace and sent it as tribute to the king of Assyria.
9973	12	16	9	The king of Assyria responded favorably to his request; he attacked Damascus and captured it. He deported the people to Kir and executed Rezin.
9974	12	16	10	¶When King Ahaz went to meet with King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria in Damascus, he saw the altar there. King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest a drawing of the altar and a blueprint for its design.
9975	12	16	11	Uriah the priest built an altar in conformity to the plans King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. Uriah the priest finished it before King Ahaz arrived back from Damascus.
9976	12	16	12	When the king arrived back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and offered a sacrifice on it.
9977	12	16	13	He offered his burnt sacrifice and his grain offering. He poured out his libation and sprinkled the blood from his peace offerings on the altar.
9978	12	16	14	He moved the bronze altar that stood in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence from the front of the temple (between the altar and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple) and put it on the north side of the new altar.
9979	12	16	15	King Ahaz ordered Uriah the priest, “On the large altar offer the morning burnt sacrifice, the evening grain offering, the royal burnt sacrifices and grain offering, the burnt sacrifice for all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their libations. Sprinkle all the blood of the burnt sacrifice and other sacrifices on it. The bronze altar will be for my personal use.”
9980	12	16	16	So Uriah the priest did exactly as King Ahaz ordered.
9981	12	16	17	¶King Ahaz took off the frames of the movable stands, and removed the basins from them. He took “The Sea” down from the bronze bulls that supported it and put it on the stone pavement.
9982	12	16	18	He also removed the Sabbath awning that had been built in the temple and the king’s outer entranceway to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, on account of the king of Assyria.
9983	12	16	19	¶The rest of the events of Ahaz’s reign, including his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
9984	12	16	20	Ahaz passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Hezekiah replaced him as king.
9985	12	17	1	¶In the twelfth year of King Ahaz’s reign over Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria for nine years.
9986	12	17	2	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, but not to the same degree as the Israelite kings who preceded him.
9987	12	17	3	King Shalmaneser of Assyria marched up to attack him; so Hoshea became his subject and paid him tribute.
9988	12	17	4	The king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was planning a revolt. Hoshea had sent messengers to King So of Egypt and had not sent his annual tribute to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria arrested him and imprisoned him.
9989	12	17	5	The king of Assyria marched through the whole land. He attacked Samaria and besieged it for three years.
9990	12	17	6	In the ninth year of Hoshea’s reign, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the people of Israel to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, along the Habor (the river of Gozan), and in the cities of the Medes.
9991	12	17	7	¶This happened because the Israelites sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God, who brought them up from the land of Egypt and freed them from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshiped other gods;
9992	12	17	8	they observed the practices of the nations whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had driven out from before them, and followed the example of the kings of Israel.
9993	12	17	9	The Israelites said things about the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God that were not right. They built high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city.
9994	12	17	10	They set up sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
9995	12	17	11	They burned incense on all the high places just like the nations whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had driven away from before them. Their evil practices made the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> angry.
9996	12	17	12	They worshiped the disgusting idols in blatant disregard of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s command.
9997	12	17	13	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> solemnly warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and all the seers, “Turn back from your evil ways; obey my commandments and rules that are recorded in the law. I ordered your ancestors to keep this law and sent my servants the prophets to remind you of its demands.”
9998	12	17	14	But they did not pay attention and were as stubborn as their ancestors, who had not trusted the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God.
9999	12	17	15	They rejected his rules, the covenant he had made with their ancestors, and the laws he had commanded them to obey. They paid allegiance to worthless idols, and so became worthless to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They copied the practices of the surrounding nations in blatant disregard of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s command.
10000	12	17	16	They abandoned all the commandments of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God; they made two metal calves and an Asherah pole, bowed down to all the stars in the sky, and worshiped Baal.
10001	12	17	17	They passed their sons and daughters through the fire, and practiced divination and omen reading. They committed themselves to doing evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and made him angry.
10002	12	17	18	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was furious with Israel and rejected them; only the tribe of Judah was left.
10003	12	17	19	Judah also failed to keep the commandments of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God; they followed Israel’s example.
10004	12	17	20	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rejected all of Israel’s descendants; he humiliated them and handed them over to robbers, until he had thrown them from his presence.
10005	12	17	21	He tore Israel away from David’s dynasty, and Jeroboam son of Nebat became their king. Jeroboam drove Israel away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and encouraged them to commit a serious sin.
10006	12	17	22	The Israelites followed in the sinful ways of Jeroboam and did not repudiate them.
10007	12	17	23	Finally the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rejected Israel just as he had warned he would do through all his servants the prophets. Israel was deported from its land to Assyria and remains there to this very day.
10008	12	17	24	¶The king of Assyria brought foreigners from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the Israelites. They took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.
10009	12	17	25	When they first moved in, they did not worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent lions among them and the lions were killing them.
10010	12	17	26	The king of Assyria was told, “The nations whom you deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land, so he has sent lions among them. They are killing the people because they do not know the requirements of the God of the land.”
10011	12	17	27	So the king of Assyria ordered, “Take back one of the priests whom you deported from there. He must settle there and teach them the requirements of the God of the land.”
10012	12	17	28	So one of the priests whom they had deported from Samaria went back and settled in Bethel. He taught them how to worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
10013	12	17	29	¶But each of these nations made its own gods and put them in the shrines on the high places that the people of Samaria had made. Each nation did this in the cities where they lived.
10014	12	17	30	The people from Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the people from Cuth made Nergal, the people from Hamath made Ashima,
10015	12	17	31	the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their sons in the fire as an offering to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
10016	12	17	32	At the same time they worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They appointed some of their own people to serve as priests in the shrines on the high places.
10017	12	17	33	They were worshiping the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and at the same time serving their own gods in accordance with the practices of the nations from which they had been deported.
10018	12	17	34	¶To this very day they observe their earlier practices. They do not worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; they do not obey the rules, regulations, law, and commandments that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave the descendants of Jacob, whom he renamed Israel.
10019	12	17	35	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made a covenant with them and instructed them, “You must not worship other gods. Do not bow down to them, serve them, or offer sacrifices to them.
10020	12	17	36	Instead you must worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who brought you up from the land of Egypt by his great power and military ability; bow down to him and offer sacrifices to him.
10021	12	17	37	You must carefully obey at all times the rules, regulations, law, and commandments he wrote down for you. You must not worship other gods.
10022	12	17	38	You must never forget the covenant I made with you, and you must not worship other gods.
10023	12	17	39	Instead you must worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God; then he will rescue you from the power of all your enemies.”
10024	12	17	40	But they pay no attention; instead they observe their earlier practices.
10025	12	17	41	These nations are worshiping the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and at the same time serving their idols; their sons and grandsons do just as their fathers have done, to this very day.
10026	12	18	1	¶In the third year of the reign of Israel’s King Hoshea son of Elah, Ahaz’s son Hezekiah became king over Judah.
10027	12	18	2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah.
10028	12	18	3	He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved, just as his ancestor David had done.
10029	12	18	4	He eliminated the high places, smashed the sacred pillars to bits, and cut down the Asherah pole. He also demolished the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been offering incense to it; it was called Nehushtan.
10030	12	18	5	He trusted in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel; in this regard there was none like him among the kings of Judah either before or after.
10031	12	18	6	He was loyal to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and did not abandon him. He obeyed the commandments which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had given to Moses.
10032	12	18	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with him; he succeeded in all his endeavors. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to submit to him.
10033	12	18	8	He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.
10034	12	18	9	¶In the fourth year of King Hezekiah’s reign (it was the seventh year of the reign of Israel’s King Hoshea, son of Elah), King Shalmaneser of Assyria marched up against Samaria and besieged it.
10035	12	18	10	After three years he captured it (in the sixth year of Hezekiah’s reign); in the ninth year of King Hoshea’s reign over Israel Samaria was captured.
10036	12	18	11	The king of Assyria deported the people of Israel to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, along the Habor (the river of Gozan), and in the cities of the Medes.
10037	12	18	12	This happened because they did not obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God and broke his covenant with them. They did not pay attention to and obey all that Moses, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant, had commanded.
10038	12	18	13	¶In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, King Sennacherib of Assyria marched up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
10039	12	18	14	King Hezekiah of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria, who was at Lachish, “I have violated our treaty. If you leave, I will do whatever you demand.” So the king of Assyria demanded that King Hezekiah of Judah pay three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
10040	12	18	15	Hezekiah gave him all the silver in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and in the treasuries of the royal palace.
10041	12	18	16	At that time King Hezekiah of Judah stripped the metal overlays from the doors of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and from the posts which he had plated and gave them to the king of Assyria.
10042	12	18	17	¶The king of Assyria sent his commanding general, the chief eunuch, and the chief adviser from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem, along with a large army. They went up and arrived at Jerusalem. They went and stood at the conduit of the upper pool which is located on the road to the field where they wash and dry cloth.
10043	12	18	18	They summoned the king, so Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went out to meet them.
10044	12	18	19	¶The chief adviser said to them, “Tell Hezekiah: ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: “What is your source of confidence?
10045	12	18	20	Your claim to have a strategy and military strength is just empty talk. In whom are you trusting that you would dare to rebel against me?
10046	12	18	21	Now look, you must be trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed staff. If a man leans for support on it, it punctures his hand and wounds him. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt does to all who trust in him.
10047	12	18	22	Perhaps you will tell me, ‘We are trusting in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.’ But Hezekiah is the one who eliminated his high places and altars and then told the people of Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship at this altar in Jerusalem.’
10048	12	18	23	Now make a deal with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, provided you can find enough riders for them.
10049	12	18	24	Certainly you will not refuse one of my master’s minor officials and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen.
10050	12	18	25	Furthermore it was by the command of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that I marched up against this place to destroy it. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me, ‘March up against this land and destroy it.’”’”
10051	12	18	26	¶Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the chief adviser, “Speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak with us in the Judahite dialect in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”
10052	12	18	27	But the chief adviser said to them, “My master did not send me to speak these words only to your master and to you. His message is also for the men who sit on the wall, for they will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you.”
10053	12	18	28	¶The chief adviser then stood there and called out loudly in the Judahite dialect, “Listen to the message of the great king, the king of Assyria.
10054	12	18	29	This is what the king says: ‘Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you, for he is not able to rescue you from my hand!
10055	12	18	30	Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> when he says, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will certainly rescue us; this city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”
10056	12	18	31	Don’t listen to Hezekiah!’ For this is what the king of Assyria says, ‘Send me a token of your submission and surrender to me. Then each of you may eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,
10057	12	18	32	until I come and take you to a land just like your own – a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey. Then you will live and not die. Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will rescue us.”
10058	12	18	33	Have any of the gods of the nations actually rescued his land from the power of the king of Assyria?
10059	12	18	34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Indeed, did any gods rescue Samaria from my power?
10060	12	18	35	Who among all the gods of the lands has rescued their lands from my power? So how can the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rescue Jerusalem from my power?’”
10061	12	18	36	The people were silent and did not respond, for the king had ordered, “Don’t respond to him.”
10062	12	18	37	¶Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him what the chief adviser had said.
10063	12	19	1	When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
10064	12	19	2	He sent Eliakim the palace supervisor, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, clothed in sackcloth to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
10065	12	19	3	They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says:‘This is a day of distress, insults, and humiliation, as when a baby is ready to leave the birth canal, but the mother lacks the strength to push it through.
10066	12	19	4	Perhaps the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will hear all these things the chief adviser has spoken on behalf of his master, the king of Assyria, who sent him to taunt the living God. When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God hears, perhaps he will punish him for the things he has said. So pray for this remnant that remains.’”
10067	12	19	5	¶When King Hezekiah’s servants came to Isaiah,
10068	12	19	6	Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master this: ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: “Don’t be afraid because of the things you have heard, because the Assyrian king’s officers have insulted me.
10069	12	19	7	Look, I will take control of his mind; he will receive a report and return to his own land. I will cut him down with a sword in his own land.”’”
10070	12	19	8	¶When the chief adviser heard the king of Assyria had departed from Lachish, he left and went to Libnah, where the king was campaigning.
10071	12	19	9	The king heard that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was marching out to fight him. He again sent messengers to Hezekiah, ordering them:
10072	12	19	10	“Tell King Hezekiah of Judah this: ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust mislead you when he says, “Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”
10073	12	19	11	Certainly you have heard how the kings of Assyria have annihilated all lands. Do you really think you will be rescued?
10074	12	19	12	Were the nations whom my ancestors destroyed – the nations of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden in Telassar – rescued by their gods?
10075	12	19	13	Where are the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”
10076	12	19	14	¶Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and spread it out before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
10077	12	19	15	Hezekiah prayed before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: “<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord </span> God of Israel, who is enthroned on the cherubim! You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the sky and the earth.
10078	12	19	16	Pay attention, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and hear! Open your eyes, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and observe! Listen to the message Sennacherib sent and how he taunts the living God!
10079	12	19	17	It is true, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands.
10080	12	19	18	They have burned the gods of the nations, for they are not really gods, but only the product of human hands manufactured from wood and stone. That is why the Assyrians could destroy them.
10081	12	19	19	Now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, rescue us from his power, so that all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, are the only God.”
10082	12	19	20	¶Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said: ‘I have heard your prayer concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria.
10083	12	19	21	This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says about him: ‡“The virgin daughter Zion ‡despises you, she makes fun of you;‡Daughter Jerusalem ‡shakes her head after you.
10084	12	19	22	‡Whom have you taunted and hurled insults at?‡At whom have you shouted, ‡and looked so arrogantly? ‡At the Holy One of Israel!
10085	12	19	23	‡Through your messengers you taunted the Sovereign Master, ‡‘With my many chariots ‡I climbed up the high mountains, ‡the slopes of Lebanon.‡I cut down its tall cedars,‡and its best evergreens.‡I invaded its most remote regions, ‡its thickest woods.
10086	12	19	24	‡I dug wells and drank‡water in foreign lands. ‡With the soles of my feet I dried up‡all the rivers of Egypt.’
10087	12	19	25	‡Certainly you must have heard! ‡Long ago I worked it out.‡In ancient times I planned it;‡and now I am bringing it to pass.‡The plan is this:‡Fortified cities will crash‡into heaps of ruins.
10088	12	19	26	‡Their residents are powerless, ‡they are terrified and ashamed.‡They are as short-lived as plants in the field,‡or green vegetation. ‡They are as short-lived as grass on the rooftops ‡when it is scorched by the east wind.
10089	12	19	27	‡I know where you live,‡and everything you do.
10090	12	19	28	‡Because you rage against me,‡and the uproar you create has reached my ears; ‡I will put my hook in your nose, ‡and my bridle between your lips,‡and I will lead you back the way‡you came.”
10091	12	19	29	¶This will be your confirmation that I have spoken the truth: This year you will eat what grows wild, and next year what grows on its own from that. But in the third year you will plant seed and harvest crops; you will plant vines and consume their produce.
10092	12	19	30	Those who remain in Judah will take root in the ground and bear fruit.
10093	12	19	31	‡For a remnant will leave Jerusalem; ‡survivors will come out of Mount Zion.‡The zeal of <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will accomplish this.
10094	12	19	32	‡So this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said about the king of Assyria: ‡“He will not enter this city,‡nor will he shoot an arrow here. ‡He will not attack it with his shield-carrying warriors, ‡nor will he build siege works against it.
10095	12	19	33	‡He will go back the way he came.‡He will not enter this city,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
10096	12	19	34	¶I will shield this city and rescue it for the sake of my reputation and because of my promise to David my servant.’”
10097	12	19	35	¶That very night the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel went out and killed 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp. When they got up early the next morning, there were all the corpses.
10098	12	19	36	So King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and went on his way. He went home and stayed in Nineveh.
10099	12	19	37	One day, as he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword. They escaped to the land of Ararat; his son Esarhaddon replaced him as king.
10100	12	20	1	¶In those days Hezekiah was stricken with a terminal illness. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz visited him and told him, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘Give your household instructions, for you are about to die; you will not get well.’”
10101	12	20	2	He turned his face to the wall and prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
10102	12	20	3	“Please, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Remember how I have served you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion, and how I have carried out your will.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly.
10103	12	20	4	¶Isaiah had not yet left the middle courtyard when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to him,
10104	12	20	5	“Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people: ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of your ancestor David has said: “I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I will heal you. The day after tomorrow you will go up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
10105	12	20	6	I will add fifteen years to your life and rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will shield this city for the sake of my reputation and because of my promise to David my servant.”’”
10106	12	20	7	Isaiah ordered, “Get a fig cake.” So they did as he ordered and placed it on the ulcerated sore, and he recovered.
10107	12	20	8	¶Hezekiah had said to Isaiah, “What is the confirming sign that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will heal me and that I will go up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple the day after tomorrow?”
10108	12	20	9	Isaiah replied, “This is your sign from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> confirming that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will do what he has said. Do you want the shadow to move ahead ten steps or to go back ten steps?”
10109	12	20	10	Hezekiah answered, “It is easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps, but not for it to go back ten steps.”
10110	12	20	11	Isaiah the prophet called out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made the shadow go back ten steps on the stairs of Ahaz.
10111	12	20	12	¶At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah was ill.
10112	12	20	13	Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them his whole storehouse, with its silver, gold, spices, and high quality olive oil, as well as his armory and everything in his treasuries. Hezekiah showed them everything in his palace and in his whole kingdom.
10113	12	20	14	Isaiah the prophet visited King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say? Where do they come from?” Hezekiah replied, “They come from the distant land of Babylon.”
10114	12	20	15	Isaiah asked, “What have they seen in your palace?” Hezekiah replied, “They have seen everything in my palace. I showed them everything in my treasuries.”
10115	12	20	16	Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message,
10116	12	20	17	‘Look, a time is coming when everything in your palace and the things your ancestors have accumulated to this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
10117	12	20	18	‘Some of your very own descendants whom you father will be taken away and will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”
10118	12	20	19	Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message which you have announced is appropriate.” Then he added, “At least there will be peace and stability during my lifetime.”
10119	12	20	20	¶The rest of the events of Hezekiah’s reign and all his accomplishments, including how he built a pool and conduit to bring water into the city, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
10120	12	20	21	Hezekiah passed away and his son Manasseh replaced him as king.
10121	12	21	1	¶Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hephzibah.
10122	12	21	2	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and committed the same horrible sins practiced by the nations whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> drove out from before the Israelites.
10123	12	21	3	He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he set up altars for Baal and made an Asherah pole just like King Ahab of Israel had done. He bowed down to all the stars in the sky and worshiped them.
10124	12	21	4	He built altars in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, about which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had said, “Jerusalem will be my home.”
10125	12	21	5	In the two courtyards of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple he built altars for all the stars in the sky.
10126	12	21	6	He passed his son through the fire and practiced divination and omen reading. He set up a ritual pit to conjure up underworld spirits, and appointed magicians to supervise it. He did a great amount of evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, provoking him to anger.
10127	12	21	7	He put an idol of Asherah he had made in the temple, about which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had said to David and to his son Solomon, “This temple in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will be my permanent home.
10128	12	21	8	I will not make Israel again leave the land I gave to their ancestors, provided that they carefully obey all I commanded them, the whole law my servant Moses ordered them to obey.”
10129	12	21	9	But they did not obey, and Manasseh misled them so that they sinned more than the nations whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had destroyed from before the Israelites.
10130	12	21	10	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> announced through his servants the prophets:
10131	12	21	11	“King Manasseh of Judah has committed horrible sins. He has sinned more than the Amorites before him and has encouraged Judah to sin by worshiping his disgusting idols.
10132	12	21	12	So this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said, ‘I am about to bring disaster on Jerusalem and Judah. The news will reverberate in the ears of those who hear about it.
10133	12	21	13	I will destroy Jerusalem the same way I did Samaria and the dynasty of Ahab. I will wipe Jerusalem clean, just as one wipes a plate on both sides.
10134	12	21	14	I will abandon this last remaining tribe among my people and hand them over to their enemies; they will be plundered and robbed by all their enemies,
10135	12	21	15	because they have done evil in my sight and have angered me from the time their ancestors left Egypt right up to this very day!’”
10136	12	21	16	¶Furthermore Manasseh killed so many innocent people, he stained Jerusalem with their blood from end to end, in addition to encouraging Judah to sin by doing evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
10137	12	21	17	¶The rest of the events of Manasseh’s reign and all his accomplishments, as well as the sinful acts he committed, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
10138	12	21	18	Manasseh passed away and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzzah, and his son Amon replaced him as king.
10139	12	21	19	¶Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. His mother was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz, from Jotbah.
10140	12	21	20	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, just like his father Manasseh had done.
10141	12	21	21	He followed in the footsteps of his father and worshiped and bowed down to the disgusting idols which his father had worshiped.
10142	12	21	22	He abandoned the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of his ancestors and did not follow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s instructions.
10143	12	21	23	Amon’s servants conspired against him and killed the king in his palace.
10144	12	21	24	The people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
10145	12	21	25	¶The rest of Amon’s accomplishments are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
10146	12	21	26	He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzzah, and his son Josiah replaced him as king.
10147	12	22	1	¶Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jedidah, daughter of Adaiah, from Bozkath.
10148	12	22	2	He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved and followed in his ancestor David’s footsteps; he did not deviate to the right or the left.
10149	12	22	3	¶In the eighteenth year of King Josiah’s reign, the king sent the scribe Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple with these orders:
10150	12	22	4	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him melt down the silver that has been brought by the people to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and has been collected by the guards at the door.
10151	12	22	5	Have them hand it over to the construction foremen assigned to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. They in turn should pay the temple workers to repair it,
10152	12	22	6	including craftsmen, builders, and masons, and should buy wood and chiseled stone for the repair work.
10153	12	22	7	Do not audit the foremen who disburse the silver, for they are honest.”
10154	12	22	8	¶Hilkiah the high priest informed Shaphan the scribe, “I found the law scroll in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.” Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan and he read it.
10155	12	22	9	Shaphan the scribe went to the king and reported, “Your servants melted down the silver in the temple and handed it over to the construction foremen assigned to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.”
10156	12	22	10	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll.” Shaphan read it out loud before the king.
10157	12	22	11	When the king heard the words of the law scroll, he tore his clothes.
10158	12	22	12	The king ordered Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant,
10159	12	22	13	“Go, seek an oracle from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for me and the people – for all Judah. Find out about the words of this scroll that has been discovered. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s great fury has been ignited against us, because our ancestors have not obeyed the words of this scroll by doing all that it instructs us to do.”
10160	12	22	14	¶So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shullam son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, the supervisor of the wardrobe. (She lived in Jerusalem in the Mishneh district.) They stated their business,
10161	12	22	15	and she said to them: “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said: ‘Say this to the man who sent you to me:
10162	12	22	16	“This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: ‘I am about to bring disaster on this place and its residents, all the things in the scroll which the king of Judah has read.
10163	12	22	17	This will happen because they have abandoned me and offered sacrifices to other gods, angering me with all the idols they have made. My anger will ignite against this place and will not be extinguished!’”
10164	12	22	18	Say this to the king of Judah, who sent you to seek an oracle from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said concerning the words you have heard:
10165	12	22	19	‘You displayed a sensitive spirit and humbled yourself before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> when you heard how I intended to make this place and its residents into an appalling example of an accursed people. You tore your clothes and wept before me, and I have heard you,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
10166	12	22	20	‘Therefore I will allow you to die and be buried in peace. You will not have to witness all the disaster I will bring on this place.’”’” Then they reported back to the king.
10167	12	23	1	¶The king summoned all the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem.
10168	12	23	2	The king went up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, accompanied by all the people of Judah, all the residents of Jerusalem, the priests, and the prophets. All the people were there, from the youngest to the oldest. He read aloud all the words of the scroll of the covenant that had been discovered in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
10169	12	23	3	The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, agreeing to follow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and to obey his commandments, laws, and rules with all his heart and being, by carrying out the terms of this covenant recorded on this scroll. All the people agreed to keep the covenant.
10170	12	23	4	¶The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the high-ranking priests, and the guards to bring out of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple all the items that were used in the worship of Baal, Asherah, and all the stars of the sky. The king burned them outside of Jerusalem in the terraces of Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.
10171	12	23	5	He eliminated the pagan priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to offer sacrifices on the high places in the cities of Judah and in the area right around Jerusalem. (They offered sacrifices to Baal, the sun god, the moon god, the constellations, and all the stars in the sky.)
10172	12	23	6	He removed the Asherah pole from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and took it outside Jerusalem to the Kidron Valley, where he burned it. He smashed it to dust and then threw the dust in the public graveyard.
10173	12	23	7	He tore down the quarters of the male cultic prostitutes in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, where women were weaving shrines for Asherah.
10174	12	23	8	¶He brought all the priests from the cities of Judah and ruined the high places where the priests had offered sacrifices, from Geba to Beer Sheba. He tore down the high place of the goat idols situated at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the city official, on the left side of the city gate.
10175	12	23	9	(Now the priests of the high places did not go up to the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened cakes among their fellow priests.)
10176	12	23	10	The king ruined Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom so that no one could pass his son or his daughter through the fire to Molech.
10177	12	23	11	He removed from the entrance to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple the statues of horses that the kings of Judah had placed there in honor of the sun god. (They were kept near the room of Nathan Melech the eunuch, which was situated among the courtyards.) He burned up the chariots devoted to the sun god.
10178	12	23	12	The king tore down the altars the kings of Judah had set up on the roof of Ahaz’s upper room, as well as the altars Manasseh had set up in the two courtyards of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. He crushed them up and threw the dust in the Kidron Valley.
10179	12	23	13	The king ruined the high places east of Jerusalem, south of the Mount of Destruction, that King Solomon of Israel had built for the detestable Sidonian goddess Astarte, the detestable Moabite god Chemosh, and the horrible Ammonite god Milcom.
10180	12	23	14	He smashed the sacred pillars to bits, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled those shrines with human bones.
10181	12	23	15	¶He also tore down the altar in Bethel at the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who encouraged Israel to sin. He burned all the combustible items at that high place and crushed them to dust; including the Asherah pole.
10182	12	23	16	When Josiah turned around, he saw the tombs there on the hill. So he ordered the bones from the tombs to be brought; he burned them on the altar and defiled it, just as in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message that was announced by the prophet while Jeroboam stood by the altar during a festival. Then the king turned and saw the grave of the prophet who had foretold this.
10183	12	23	17	He asked, “What is this grave marker I see?” The men from the city replied, “It’s the grave of the prophet who came from Judah and foretold these very things you have done to the altar of Bethel.”
10184	12	23	18	The king said, “Leave it alone! No one must touch his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed, as well as the bones of the Israelite prophet buried beside him.
10185	12	23	19	¶Josiah also removed all the shrines on the high places in the cities of Samaria. The kings of Israel had made them and angered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He did to them what he had done to the high place in Bethel.
10186	12	23	20	He sacrificed all the priests of the high places on the altars located there, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
10187	12	23	21	¶The king ordered all the people, “Observe the Passover of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, as prescribed in this scroll of the covenant.”
10188	12	23	22	He issued this edict because a Passover like this had not been observed since the days of the judges who led Israel; it was neglected for the entire period of the kings of Israel and Judah.
10189	12	23	23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah’s reign, such a Passover of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was observed in Jerusalem.
10190	12	23	24	¶Josiah also got rid of the ritual pits used to conjure up spirits, the magicians, personal idols, disgusting images, and all the detestable idols that had appeared in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. In this way he carried out the terms of the law recorded on the scroll that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
10191	12	23	25	No king before or after repented before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as he did, with his whole heart, soul, and being in accordance with the whole law of Moses.
10192	12	23	26	¶Yet the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s great anger against Judah did not subside; he was still infuriated by all the things Manasseh had done.
10193	12	23	27	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> announced, “I will also spurn Judah, just as I spurned Israel. I will reject this city that I chose – both Jerusalem and the temple, about which I said, “I will live there.”
10194	12	23	28	¶The rest of the events of Josiah’s reign and all his accomplishments are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
10195	12	23	29	During Josiah’s reign Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt marched toward the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to fight him, but Necho killed him at Megiddo when he saw him.
10196	12	23	30	His servants transported his dead body from Megiddo in a chariot and brought it to Jerusalem, where they buried him in his tomb. The people of the land took Josiah’s son Jehoahaz, poured olive oil on his head, and made him king in his father’s place.
10197	12	23	31	¶Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.
10198	12	23	32	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as his ancestors had done.
10199	12	23	33	Pharaoh Necho imprisoned him in Riblah in the land of Hamath and prevented him from ruling in Jerusalem. He imposed on the land a special tax of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
10200	12	23	34	Pharaoh Necho made Josiah’s son Eliakim king in Josiah’s place, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. He took Jehoahaz to Egypt, where he died.
10201	12	23	35	Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh the required amount of silver and gold, but to meet Pharaoh’s demands Jehoiakim had to tax the land. He collected an assessed amount from each man among the people of the land in order to pay Pharaoh Necho.
10202	12	23	36	¶Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah.
10203	12	23	37	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as his ancestors had done.
10204	12	24	1	¶During Jehoiakim’s reign, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked. Jehoiakim was his subject for three years, but then he rebelled against him.
10205	12	24	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent against him Babylonian, Syrian, Moabite, and Ammonite raiding bands; he sent them to destroy Judah, just as in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message that he had announced through his servants the prophets.
10206	12	24	3	Just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had announced, he rejected Judah because of all the sins which Manasseh had committed.
10207	12	24	4	Because he killed innocent people and stained Jerusalem with their blood, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was unwilling to forgive them.
10208	12	24	5	¶The rest of the events of Jehoiakim’s reign and all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
10209	12	24	6	He passed away and his son Jehoiachin replaced him as king.
10210	12	24	7	The king of Egypt did not march out from his land again, for the king of Babylon conquered all the territory that the king of Egypt had formerly controlled between the Stream of Egypt and the Euphrates River.
10211	12	24	8	¶Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan, from Jerusalem.
10212	12	24	9	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as his ancestors had done.
10213	12	24	10	¶At that time the generals of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched to Jerusalem and besieged the city.
10214	12	24	11	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city while his generals were besieging it.
10215	12	24	12	King Jehoiachin of Judah, along with his mother, his servants, his officials, and his eunuchs surrendered to the king of Babylon. The king of Babylon, in the eighth year of his reign, took Jehoiachin prisoner.
10216	12	24	13	Nebuchadnezzar took from there all the riches in the treasuries of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and of the royal palace. He removed all the gold items which King Solomon of Israel had made for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had warned.
10217	12	24	14	He deported all the residents of Jerusalem, including all the officials and all the soldiers (10,000 people in all). This included all the craftsmen and those who worked with metal. No one was left except for the poorest among the people of the land.
10218	12	24	15	He deported Jehoiachin from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with the king’s mother and wives, his eunuchs, and the high-ranking officials of the land.
10219	12	24	16	The king of Babylon deported to Babylon all the soldiers (there were 7,000), as well as 1,000 craftsmen and metal workers. This included all the best warriors.
10220	12	24	17	The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in Jehoiachin’s place. He renamed him Zedekiah.
10221	12	24	18	¶Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.
10222	12	24	19	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, as Jehoiakim had done.
10223	12	24	20	¶What follows is a record of what happened to Jerusalem and Judah because of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anger; he finally threw them out of his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
10224	12	25	1	So King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against Jerusalem with his whole army and set up camp outside it. They built siege ramps all around it. He arrived on the tenth day of the tenth month in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign.
10225	12	25	2	The city remained under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
10226	12	25	3	By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city was so severe the residents had no food.
10227	12	25	4	The enemy broke through the city walls, and all the soldiers tried to escape. They left the city during the night. They went through the gate between the two walls that is near the king’s garden. (The Babylonians were all around the city.) Then they headed for the rift valley.
10228	12	25	5	But the Babylonian army chased after the king. They caught up with him in the rift valley plains of Jericho, and his entire army deserted him.
10229	12	25	6	They captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where he passed sentence on him.
10230	12	25	7	Zedekiah’s sons were executed while Zedekiah was forced to watch. The king of Babylon then had Zedekiah’s eyes put out, bound him in bronze chains, and carried him off to Babylon.
10231	12	25	8	¶On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard who served the king of Babylon, arrived in Jerusalem.
10232	12	25	9	He burned down the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, the royal palace, and all the houses in Jerusalem, including every large house.
10233	12	25	10	The whole Babylonian army that came with the captain of the royal guard tore down the walls that surrounded Jerusalem.
10234	12	25	11	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, deported the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen.
10235	12	25	12	But he left behind some of the poor of the land and gave them fields and vineyards.
10236	12	25	13	¶The Babylonians broke the two bronze pillars in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, as well as the movable stands and the big bronze basin called “The Sea.” They took the bronze to Babylon.
10237	12	25	14	They also took the pots, shovels, trimming shears, pans, and all the bronze utensils used by the priests.
10238	12	25	15	The captain of the royal guard took the golden and silver censers and basins.
10239	12	25	16	The bronze of the items that King Solomon made for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple – including the two pillars, the big bronze basin called “The Sea,” the twelve bronze bulls under “The Sea,” and the movable stands – was too heavy to be weighed.
10240	12	25	17	Each of the pillars was about twenty-seven feet high. The bronze top of one pillar was about four and a half feet high and had bronze latticework and pomegranate shaped ornaments all around it. The second pillar with its latticework was like it.
10241	12	25	18	¶The captain of the royal guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah, the priest who was second in rank, and the three doorkeepers.
10242	12	25	19	From the city he took a eunuch who was in charge of the soldiers, five of the king’s advisers who were discovered in the city, an official army secretary who drafted citizens for military service, and sixty citizens from the people of the land who were discovered in the city.
10243	12	25	20	Nebuzaradan, captain of the royal guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
10244	12	25	21	The king of Babylon ordered them to be executed at Riblah in the territory of Hamath. So Judah was deported from its land.
10245	12	25	22	¶Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over the people whom he allowed to remain in the land of Judah.
10246	12	25	23	All of the officers of the Judahite army and their troops heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah to govern. So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The officers who came were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite.
10247	12	25	24	Gedaliah took an oath so as to give them and their troops some assurance of safety. He said, “You don’t need to be afraid to submit to the Babylonian officials. Settle down in the land and submit to the king of Babylon. Then things will go well for you.”
10248	12	25	25	But in the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family, came with ten of his men and murdered Gedaliah, as well as the Judeans and Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah.
10249	12	25	26	Then all the people, from the youngest to the oldest, as well as the army officers, left for Egypt, because they were afraid of what the Babylonians might do.
10250	12	25	27	¶In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, King Evil-Merodach of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison.
10251	12	25	28	He spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prestigious position than the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
10252	12	25	29	Jehoiachin took off his prison clothes and ate daily in the king’s presence for the rest of his life.
10253	12	25	30	He was given daily provisions by the king for the rest of his life until the day he died.

10448	13	5	19	They attacked the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.
10449	13	5	20	They received divine help in fighting them, and the Hagrites and all their allies were handed over to them. They cried out to God during the battle; he responded to their prayers because they trusted in him.
10450	13	5	21	They seized the Hagrites’ animals, including 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys. They also took captive 100,000 people.

10455	13	5	26	So the God of Israel stirred up King Pul of Assyria (that is, King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria), and he carried away the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh and took them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan, where they remain to this very day.

10635	13	9	19	¶Shallum son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his relatives from his family (the Korahites) were assigned to guard the entrance to the sanctuary. Their ancestors had guarded the entrance to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s dwelling place.

10650	13	9	34	These were the family leaders of the Levites, as listed in their genealogical records. They lived in Jerusalem.
10651	13	9	35	¶Jeiel (the father of Gibeon) lived in Gibeon. His wife was Maacah.

10654	13	9	38	Mikloth was the father of Shimeam. They also lived near their relatives in Jerusalem.
10655	13	9	39	¶Ner was the father of Kish, and Kish was the father of Saul. Saul was the father of Jonathan, Malki-Shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
10656	13	9	40	¶The son of Jonathan:¶Meribbaal, who was the father of Micah.
10657	13	9	41	¶The sons of Micah:¶Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz.
10658	13	9	42	¶Ahaz was the father of Jarah, and Jarah was the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. Zimri was the father of Moza,
10659	13	9	43	and Moza was the father of Binea. His son was Rephaiah, whose son was Eleasah, whose son was Azel.
10660	13	9	44	¶Azel had six sons: Azrikam his firstborn, followed by Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.
10661	13	10	1	¶Now the Philistines fought against Israel. The Israelites fled before the Philistines and many of them fell dead on Mount Gilboa.
10662	13	10	2	The Philistines stayed right on the heels of Saul and his sons. They struck down Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua.
10663	13	10	3	The battle was thick around Saul; the archers spotted him and wounded him.
10664	13	10	4	Saul told his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and stab me with it. Otherwise these uncircumcised people will come and torture me.” But his armor bearer refused to do it, because he was very afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it.
10665	13	10	5	When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died.
10666	13	10	6	So Saul and his three sons died; his whole household died together.
10667	13	10	7	When all the Israelites who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. The Philistines came and occupied them.
10668	13	10	8	¶The next day, when the Philistines came to strip loot from the corpses, they discovered Saul and his sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa.
10669	13	10	9	They stripped his corpse, and then carried off his head and his armor. They sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines proclaiming the news to their idols and their people.
10670	13	10	10	They placed his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his head in the temple of Dagon.
10671	13	10	11	When all the residents of Jabesh Gilead heard about everything the Philistines had done to Saul,
10672	13	10	12	all the warriors went and recovered the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. They buried their remains under the oak tree in Jabesh and fasted for seven days.
10673	13	10	13	¶So Saul died because he was unfaithful to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and did not obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s instructions; he even tried to conjure up underworld spirits.
10674	13	10	14	He did not seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s guidance, so the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> killed him and transferred the kingdom to David son of Jesse.
10675	13	11	1	¶All Israel joined David at Hebron and said, “Look, we are your very flesh and blood!
10676	13	11	2	In the past, even when Saul was king, you were Israel’s commanding general. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel; you will rule over my people Israel.’”
10677	13	11	3	When all the leaders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They anointed David king over Israel, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message that came through Samuel.
10678	13	11	4	¶David and the whole Israelite army advanced to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). (The Jebusites, the land’s original inhabitants, lived there.)
10679	13	11	5	The residents of Jebus said to David, “You cannot invade this place!” But David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David).
10680	13	11	6	David said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become commanding general!” So Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first and became commander.
10681	13	11	7	David lived in the fortress; for this reason it is called the City of David.
10682	13	11	8	He built up the city around it, from the terrace to the surrounding walls; Joab restored the rest of the city.
10683	13	11	9	David’s power steadily grew, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies was with him.
10684	13	11	10	¶These were the leaders of David’s warriors who, together with all Israel, stood courageously with him in his kingdom by installing him as king, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message concerning Israel.
10685	13	11	11	This is the list of David’s warriors: ¶Jashobeam, a Hacmonite, was head of the officers. He killed three hundred men with his spear in a single battle.
10686	13	11	12	¶Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. He was one of the three elite warriors.
10687	13	11	13	He was with David in Pas Dammim when the Philistines assembled there for battle. In an area of the field that was full of barley, the army retreated before the Philistines,
10688	13	11	14	but then they made a stand in the middle of that area. They defended it and defeated the Philistines; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave them a great victory.
10689	13	11	15	¶Three of the thirty leaders went down to David at the rocky cliff at the cave of Adullam, while a Philistine force was camped in the Valley of Rephaim.
10690	13	11	16	David was in the stronghold at the time, while a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem.
10691	13	11	17	David was thirsty and said, “How I wish someone would give me some water to drink from the cistern in Bethlehem near the city gate!”
10692	13	11	18	So the three elite warriors broke through the Philistine forces and drew some water from the cistern in Bethlehem near the city gate. They carried it back to David, but David refused to drink it. He poured it out as a drink offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>
10693	13	11	19	and said, “God forbid that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” Because they risked their lives to bring it to him, he refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three elite warriors.
10694	13	11	20	¶Abishai the brother of Joab was head of the three elite warriors. He killed three hundred men with his spear and gained fame along with the three elite warriors.
10695	13	11	21	From the three he was given double honor and he became their officer, even though he was not one of them.
10696	13	11	22	¶Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave warrior from Kabzeel who performed great exploits. He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab; he also went down and killed a lion inside a cistern on a snowy day.
10697	13	11	23	He even killed an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand as big as the crossbeam of a weaver’s loom; Benaiah attacked him with a club. He grabbed the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
10698	13	11	24	Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who gained fame along with the three elite warriors.
10699	13	11	25	He received honor from the thirty warriors, though he was not one of the three elite warriors. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
10700	13	11	26	¶The mighty warriors were:¶Asahel the brother of Joab,¶Elhanan son of Dodo, from Bethlehem,
10701	13	11	27	¶Shammoth the Harorite, ¶Helez the Pelonite,
10702	13	11	28	¶Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,¶Abiezer the Anathothite,

10704	13	11	30	¶Maharai the Netophathite,¶Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
10705	13	11	31	¶Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjaminite territory,¶Benaiah the Pirathonite,
10706	13	11	32	¶Hurai from the valleys of Gaash,¶Abiel the Arbathite,
10707	13	11	33	¶Azmaveth the Baharumite, ¶Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

10711	13	11	37	¶Hezro the Carmelite,¶Naarai son of Ezbai,
10712	13	11	38	¶Joel the brother of Nathan, ¶Mibhar son of Hagri,
10713	13	11	39	¶Zelek the Ammonite,¶Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
10714	13	11	40	¶Ira the Ithrite,¶Gareb the Ithrite,
10715	13	11	41	¶Uriah the Hittite,¶Zabad son of Achli,
10716	13	11	42	¶Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, leader of the Reubenites and the thirty warriors with him,
10717	13	11	43	¶Hanan son of Maacah,¶Joshaphat the Mithnite,
10718	13	11	44	¶Uzzia the Ashterathite,¶Shama and Jeiel, the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
10719	13	11	45	¶Jediael son of Shimri,¶and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
10720	13	11	46	¶Eliel the Mahavite,¶and Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam,¶and Ithmah the Moabite,
10721	13	11	47	¶Eliel,¶and Obed,¶and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
10722	13	12	1	¶These were the men who joined David in Ziklag, when he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish. (They were among the warriors who assisted him in battle.
10723	13	12	2	They were armed with bows and could shoot arrows or sling stones right or left-handed. They were fellow tribesmen of Saul from Benjamin.) These were:
10724	13	12	3	¶Ahiezer, the leader, and Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; ¶Berachah,¶Jehu the Anathothite,
10725	13	12	4	¶Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, one of the thirty warriors and their leader,¶(12:5) Jeremiah,¶Jahaziel,¶Johanan,¶Jozabad the Gederathite,
10726	13	12	5	¶(12:6) Eluzai,¶Jerimoth,¶Bealiah,¶Shemariah,¶Shephatiah the Haruphite,
10727	13	12	6	¶Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, who were Korahites,
10728	13	12	7	¶and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
10729	13	12	8	¶Some of the Gadites joined David at the stronghold in the wilderness. They were warriors who were trained for battle; they carried shields and spears. They were as fierce as lions and could run as quickly as gazelles across the hills.
10730	13	12	9	Ezer was the leader, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,
10731	13	12	10	Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
10732	13	12	11	Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
10733	13	12	12	Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
10734	13	12	13	Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh.
10735	13	12	14	These Gadites were military leaders; the least led a hundred men, the greatest a thousand.
10736	13	12	15	They crossed the Jordan River in the first month, when it was overflowing its banks, and routed those living in all the valleys to the east and west.
10737	13	12	16	¶Some from Benjamin and Judah also came to David’s stronghold.
10738	13	12	17	David went out to meet them and said, “If you come to me in peace and want to help me, then I will make an alliance with you. But if you come to betray me to my enemies when I have not harmed you, may the God of our ancestors take notice and judge!”
10739	13	12	18	But a spirit empowered Amasai, the leader of the thirty warriors, and he said: ¶“We are yours, O David! ¶We support you, O son of Jesse! ¶May you greatly prosper! ¶May those who help you prosper! ¶Indeed your God helps you!”¶So David accepted them and made them leaders of raiding bands.
10740	13	12	19	¶Some men from Manasseh joined David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (But in the end they did not help the Philistines because, after taking counsel, the Philistine lords sent David away, saying: “It would be disastrous for us if he deserts to his master Saul.”)
10741	13	12	20	When David went to Ziklag, the men of Manasseh who joined him were Adnach, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, leaders of a thousand soldiers each in the tribe of Manasseh.
10742	13	12	21	They helped David fight against raiding bands, for all of them were warriors and leaders in the army.
10743	13	12	22	Each day men came to help David until his army became very large.
10744	13	12	23	¶The following is a record of the armed warriors who came with their leaders and joined David in Hebron in order to make David king in Saul’s place, in accordance with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s decree:
10745	13	12	24	¶From Judah came 6,800 trained warriors carrying shields and spears.
10746	13	12	25	¶From Simeon there were 7,100 warriors.
10747	13	12	26	¶From Levi there were 4,600.
10748	13	12	27	Jehoiada, the leader of Aaron’s descendants, brought 3,700 men with him,
10749	13	12	28	along with Zadok, a young warrior, and twenty-two leaders from his family.
10750	13	12	29	¶From Benjamin, Saul’s tribe, there were 3,000, most of whom, up to that time, had been loyal to Saul.
10751	13	12	30	¶From Ephraim there were 20,800 warriors, who had brought fame to their families.
10752	13	12	31	¶From the half-tribe of Manasseh there were 18,000 who had been designated by name to come and make David king.
10753	13	12	32	¶From Issachar there were 200 leaders and all their relatives at their command – they understood the times and knew what Israel should do.
10754	13	12	33	¶From Zebulun there were 50,000 warriors who were prepared for battle, equipped with all kinds of weapons, and ready to give their undivided loyalty.
10755	13	12	34	¶From Naphtali there were 1,000 officers, along with 37,000 men carrying shields and spears.
10756	13	12	35	¶From Dan there were 28,600 men prepared for battle.
10757	13	12	36	¶From Asher there were 40,000 warriors prepared for battle.
10758	13	12	37	¶From the other side of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, there were 120,000 men armed with all kinds of weapons.
10759	13	12	38	¶All these men were warriors who were ready to march. They came to Hebron to make David king over all Israel by acclamation; all the rest of the Israelites also were in agreement that David should become king.
10760	13	12	39	They spent three days feasting there with David, for their relatives had given them provisions.
10761	13	12	40	Also their neighbors, from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. There were large supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, olive oil, beef, and lamb, for Israel was celebrating.
10762	13	13	1	¶David consulted with his military officers, including those who led groups of a thousand and those who led groups of a hundred.
10763	13	13	2	David said to the whole Israelite assembly, “If you so desire and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God approves, let’s spread the word to our brothers who remain in all the regions of Israel, and to the priests and Levites in their cities, so they may join us.
10764	13	13	3	Let’s move the ark of our God back here, for we did not seek his will throughout Saul’s reign.”
10765	13	13	4	The whole assembly agreed to do this, for the proposal seemed right to all the people.
10766	13	13	5	So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.
10767	13	13	6	David and all Israel went up to Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim) in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who sits enthroned between the cherubim – the ark that is called by his name.
10768	13	13	7	¶They transported the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab; Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the cart,
10769	13	13	8	while David and all Israel were energetically celebrating before God, singing and playing various stringed instruments, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
10770	13	13	9	When they arrived at the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to take hold of the ark, because the oxen stumbled.
10771	13	13	10	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was so furious with Uzzah, he killed him, because he reached out his hand and touched the ark. He died right there before God.
10772	13	13	11	¶David was angry because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> attacked Uzzah; so he called that place Perez Uzzah, which remains its name to this very day.
10773	13	13	12	David was afraid of God that day and said, “How will I ever be able to bring the ark of God up here?”
10774	13	13	13	So David did not move the ark to the City of David; he left it in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
10775	13	13	14	The ark of God remained in Obed-Edom’s house for three months; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> blessed Obed-Edom’s family and everything that belonged to him.
10776	13	14	1	¶King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons, and carpenters to build a palace for him.
10777	13	14	2	David realized that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had established him as king over Israel and that he had elevated his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
10778	13	14	3	¶In Jerusalem David married more wives and fathered more sons and daughters.
10779	13	14	4	These are the names of children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
10780	13	14	5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
10781	13	14	6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
10782	13	14	7	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
10783	13	14	8	¶When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of all Israel, all the Philistines marched up to confront him. When David heard about it, he marched out against them.
10784	13	14	9	Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim.
10785	13	14	10	David asked God, “Should I march up against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “March up! I will hand them over to you!”
10786	13	14	11	So they marched against Baal Perazim and David defeated them there. David said, “Using me as his instrument, God has burst out against my enemies like water bursts out.” So that place is called Baal Perazim.
10787	13	14	12	The Philistines left their idols there, so David ordered that they be burned.
10788	13	14	13	¶The Philistines again raided the valley.
10789	13	14	14	So David again asked God what he should do. This time God told him, “Don’t march up after them; circle around them and come against them in front of the trees.
10790	13	14	15	When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the trees, then attack. For at that moment <span class=\"smcaps\">God</span> is going before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.”
10791	13	14	16	David did just as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
10792	13	14	17	¶So David became famous in all the lands; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> caused all the nations to fear him.
10793	13	15	1	¶David constructed buildings in the City of David; he then prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
10794	13	15	2	Then David said, “Only the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> chose them to carry the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and to serve before him perpetually.”
10795	13	15	3	David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> up to the place he had prepared for it.
10796	13	15	4	David gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
10797	13	15	5	¶From the descendants of Kohath: Uriel the leader and 120 of his relatives.
10798	13	15	6	¶From the descendants of Merari: Asaiah the leader and 220 of his relatives.
10799	13	15	7	¶From the descendants of Gershom: Joel the leader and 130 of his relatives.
10800	13	15	8	¶From the descendants of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the leader and 200 of his relatives.
10801	13	15	9	¶From the descendants of Hebron: Eliel the leader and 80 of his relatives.
10802	13	15	10	¶From the descendants of Uzziel: Amminadab the leader and 112 of his relatives.
10803	13	15	11	¶David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, along with the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
10804	13	15	12	He told them: “You are the leaders of the Levites’ families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves and bring the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel up to the place I have prepared for it.
10805	13	15	13	The first time you did not carry it; that is why the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God attacked us, because we did not ask him about the proper way to carry it.”
10806	13	15	14	The priests and Levites consecrated themselves so they could bring up the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
10807	13	15	15	The descendants of Levi carried the ark of God on their shoulders with poles, just as Moses had commanded in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s instruction.
10808	13	15	16	¶David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint some of their relatives as musicians; they were to play various instruments, including stringed instruments and cymbals, and to sing loudly and joyfully.
10809	13	15	17	So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; one of his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah; one of the descendants of Merari, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
10810	13	15	18	along with some of their relatives who were second in rank, including Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.
10811	13	15	19	¶The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals;
10812	13	15	20	Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according to the <i>alamoth</i> style;
10813	13	15	21	Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to play the lyres according to the <i>sheminith</i> style, as led by the director;
10814	13	15	22	Kenaniah, the leader of the Levites, was in charge of transport, for he was well-informed on this matter;
10815	13	15	23	Berechiah and Elkanah were guardians of the ark;
10816	13	15	24	Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God; Obed-Edom and Jehiel were also guardians of the ark.
10817	13	15	25	¶So David, the leaders of Israel, and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant from the house of Obed-Edom with celebration.
10818	13	15	26	When God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
10819	13	15	27	David was wrapped in a linen robe, as were all the Levites carrying the ark, the musicians, and Kenaniah the supervisor of transport and the musicians; David also wore a linen ephod.
10820	13	15	28	All Israel brought up the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant; they were shouting, blowing trumpets, sounding cymbals, and playing stringed instruments.
10821	13	15	29	As the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant entered the City of David, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked out the window. When she saw King David jumping and celebrating, she despised him.
10822	13	16	1	¶They brought the ark of God and put it in the middle of the tent David had pitched for it. Then they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.
10823	13	16	2	When David finished offering burnt sacrifices and peace offerings, he pronounced a blessing over the people in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s name.
10824	13	16	3	He then handed out to each Israelite man and woman a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.
10825	13	16	4	He appointed some of the Levites to serve before the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, to offer prayers, songs of thanks, and hymns to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
10826	13	16	5	Asaph was the leader and Zechariah second in command, followed by Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel. They were to play stringed instruments; Asaph was to sound the cymbals;
10827	13	16	6	and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of God’s covenant.
10828	13	16	7	¶That day David first gave to Asaph and his colleagues this song of thanks to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
10829	13	16	8	‡Give thanks to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!‡Call on his name!‡Make known his accomplishments among the nations!
10830	13	16	9	‡Sing to him! Make music to him!‡Tell about all his miraculous deeds!
10831	13	16	10	‡Boast about his holy name!‡Let the hearts of those who seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rejoice!
10832	13	16	11	‡Seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and the strength he gives!‡Seek his presence continually!
10833	13	16	12	‡Recall the miraculous deeds he performed,‡his mighty acts and the judgments he decreed,
10834	13	16	13	‡O children of Israel, God’s servant,‡you descendants of Jacob, God’s chosen ones!
10835	13	16	14	‡He is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God;‡he carries out judgment throughout the earth.
10836	13	16	15	‡Remember continually his covenantal decree,‡the promise he made to a thousand generations –
10837	13	16	16	‡the promise he made to Abraham,‡the promise he made by oath to Isaac!
10838	13	16	17	‡He gave it to Jacob as a decree,‡to Israel as a lasting promise,
10839	13	16	18	‡saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan‡as the portion of your inheritance.”
10840	13	16	19	‡When they were few in number,‡just a very few, and foreign residents within it,
10841	13	16	20	‡they wandered from nation to nation,‡and from one kingdom to another.
10842	13	16	21	‡He let no one oppress them,‡he disciplined kings for their sake,
10843	13	16	22	‡saying, “Don’t touch my anointed ones!‡Don’t harm my prophets!”
10844	13	16	23	‡Sing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, all the earth!‡Announce every day how he delivers!
10845	13	16	24	‡Tell the nations about his splendor,‡tell all the nations about his miraculous deeds!
10846	13	16	25	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is great and certainly worthy of praise,‡he is more awesome than all gods.
10847	13	16	26	‡For all the gods of the nations are worthless, ‡but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made the heavens.
10848	13	16	27	‡Majestic splendor emanates from him, ‡he is the source of strength and joy.
10849	13	16	28	‡Ascribe to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, O families of the nations,‡ascribe to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> splendor and strength!
10850	13	16	29	‡Ascribe to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> the splendor he deserves! ‡Bring an offering and enter his presence!‡Worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in holy attire!
10851	13	16	30	‡Tremble before him, all the earth!‡The world is established, it cannot be moved.
10852	13	16	31	‡Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be happy!‡Let the nations say, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> reigns!’
10853	13	16	32	‡Let the sea and everything in it shout!‡Let the fields and everything in them celebrate!
10854	13	16	33	‡Then let the trees of the forest shout with joy before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡for he comes to judge the earth!
10855	13	16	34	‡Give thanks to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for he is good‡and his loyal love endures.
10856	13	16	35	‡Say this prayer: “Deliver us, O God who delivers us!‡Gather us! Rescue us from the nations!‡Then we will give thanks to your holy name,‡and boast about your praiseworthy deeds.”
10857	13	16	36	‡May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel be praised,‡in the future and forevermore. ‡Then all the people said, “We agree! Praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
10858	13	16	37	¶David left Asaph and his colleagues there before the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant to serve before the ark regularly and fulfill each day’s requirements,
10859	13	16	38	including Obed-Edom and sixty-eight colleagues. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were gatekeepers.
10860	13	16	39	Zadok the priest and his fellow priests served before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s tabernacle at the worship center in Gibeon,
10861	13	16	40	regularly offering burnt sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on the altar for burnt sacrifice, morning and evening, according to what is prescribed in the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> which he charged Israel to observe.
10862	13	16	41	Joining them were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. (For his loyal love endures!)
10863	13	16	42	Heman and Jeduthun were in charge of the music, including the trumpets, cymbals, and the other musical instruments used in praising God. The sons of Jeduthun guarded the entrance.
10864	13	16	43	¶Then all the people returned to their homes, and David went to pronounce a blessing on his family.
10865	13	17	1	¶When David had settled into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, I am living in a palace made from cedar, while the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant is under a tent.”
10866	13	17	2	Nathan said to David, “You should do whatever you have in mind, for God is with you.”
10867	13	17	3	¶That night God told Nathan,
10868	13	17	4	“Go, tell my servant David: ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: “You must not build me a house in which to live.
10869	13	17	5	For I have not lived in a house from the time I brought Israel up from Egypt to the present day. I have lived in a tent that has been in various places.
10870	13	17	6	Wherever I moved throughout Israel, I did not say to any of the leaders whom I appointed to care for my people Israel, ‘Why have you not built me a house made from cedar?’”’
10871	13	17	7	¶“So now, say this to my servant David: ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says: “I took you from the pasture and from your work as a shepherd to make you a leader of my people Israel.
10872	13	17	8	I was with you wherever you went and I defeated all your enemies before you. Now I will make you as famous as the great men of the earth.
10873	13	17	9	I will establish a place for my people Israel and settle them there; they will live there and not be disturbed anymore. Violent men will not oppress them again, as they did in the beginning
10874	13	17	10	and during the time when I appointed judges to lead my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies.¶“‘“I declare to you that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will build a dynastic house for you!
10875	13	17	11	When the time comes for you to die, I will raise up your descendant, one of your own sons, to succeed you, and I will establish his kingdom.
10876	13	17	12	He will build me a house, and I will make his dynasty permanent.
10877	13	17	13	I will become his father and he will become my son. I will never withhold my loyal love from him, as I withheld it from the one who ruled before you.
10878	13	17	14	I will put him in permanent charge of my house and my kingdom; his dynasty will be permanent.”’”
10879	13	17	15	Nathan told David all these words that were revealed to him.
10880	13	17	16	¶King David went in, sat before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and said: “Who am I, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God, and what is my family, that you should have brought me to this point?
10881	13	17	17	And you did not stop there, O God! You have also spoken about the future of your servant’s family. You have revealed to me what men long to know, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God.
10882	13	17	18	What more can David say to you? You have honored your servant; you have given your servant special recognition.
10883	13	17	19	O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing in order to reveal your greatness.
10884	13	17	20	O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, there is none like you; there is no God besides you! What we heard is true!
10885	13	17	21	And who is like your people, Israel, a unique nation in the earth? Their God went to claim a nation for himself! You made a name for yourself by doing great and awesome deeds when you drove out nations before your people whom you had delivered from the Egyptian empire and its gods.
10886	13	17	22	You made Israel your very own nation for all time. You, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, became their God.
10887	13	17	23	So now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, may the promise you made about your servant and his family become a permanent reality! Do as you promised,
10888	13	17	24	so it may become a reality and you may gain lasting fame, as people say, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies is the God of Israel.’ The dynasty of your servant David will be established before you,
10889	13	17	25	for you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a dynasty for him. That is why your servant has had the courage to pray to you.
10890	13	17	26	Now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you are the true God; you have made this good promise to your servant.
10891	13	17	27	Now you are willing to bless your servant’s dynasty so that it may stand permanently before you, for you, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have blessed it and it will be blessed from now on into the future.”
10892	13	18	1	¶Later David defeated the Philistines and subdued them. He took Gath and its surrounding towns away from the Philistines.
10893	13	18	2	¶He defeated the Moabites; the Moabites became David’s subjects and brought tribute.
10894	13	18	3	¶David defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah as far as Hamath, when he went to extend his authority to the Euphrates River.
10895	13	18	4	David seized from him 1,000 chariots, 7,000 charioteers, and 20,000 infantrymen . David cut the hamstrings of all but a hundred of Hadadezer’s chariot horses.
10896	13	18	5	The Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, but David killed 22,000 of the Arameans.
10897	13	18	6	David placed garrisons in the territory of the Arameans of Damascus; the Arameans became David’s subjects and brought tribute. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> protected David wherever he campaigned.
10898	13	18	7	David took the golden shields which Hadadezer’s servants had carried and brought them to Jerusalem.
10899	13	18	8	From Tibhath and Kun, Hadadezer’s cities, David took a great deal of bronze. (Solomon used it to make the big bronze basin called “The Sea,” the pillars, and other bronze items.)
10900	13	18	9	¶When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of King Hadadezer of Zobah,
10901	13	18	10	he sent his son Hadoram to King David to extend his best wishes and to pronounce a blessing on him for his victory over Hadadezer, for Tou had been at war with Hadadezer. He also sent various items made of gold, silver, and bronze.
10902	13	18	11	King David dedicated these things to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, along with the silver and gold which he had carried off from all the nations, including Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.
10903	13	18	12	¶Abishai son of Zeruiah killed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
10904	13	18	13	He placed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s subjects. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> protected David wherever he campaigned.
10905	13	18	14	¶David reigned over all Israel; he guaranteed justice for all his people.
10906	13	18	15	Joab son of Zeruiah was commanding general of the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was secretary;
10907	13	18	16	Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was scribe;
10908	13	18	17	Benaiah son of Jehoiada supervised the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were the king’s leading officials.
10909	13	19	1	¶Later King Nahash of the Ammonites died and his son succeeded him.
10910	13	19	2	David said, “I will express my loyalty to Hanun son of Nahash, for his father was loyal to me.” So David sent messengers to express his sympathy over his father’s death. When David’s servants entered Ammonite territory to visit Hanun and express the king’s sympathy,
10911	13	19	3	the Ammonite officials said to Hanun, “Do you really think David is trying to honor your father by sending these messengers to express his sympathy? No, his servants have come to you so they can get information and spy out the land!”
10912	13	19	4	So Hanun seized David’s servants and shaved their beards off. He cut off the lower part of their robes so that their buttocks were exposed and then sent them away.
10913	13	19	5	People came and told David what had happened to the men, so he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were thoroughly humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow again; then you may come back.”
10914	13	19	6	¶When the Ammonites realized that David was disgusted with them, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah, and Zobah.
10915	13	19	7	They hired 32,000 chariots, along with the king of Maacah and his army, who came and camped in front of Medeba. The Ammonites also assembled from their cities and marched out to do battle.
10916	13	19	8	¶When David heard the news, he sent Joab and the entire army to meet them.
10917	13	19	9	The Ammonites marched out and were deployed for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.
10918	13	19	10	When Joab saw that the battle would be fought on two fronts, he chose some of Israel’s best men and deployed them against the Arameans.
10919	13	19	11	He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the army and they were deployed against the Ammonites.
10920	13	19	12	Joab said, “If the Arameans start to overpower me, you come to my rescue. If the Ammonites start to overpower you, I will come to your rescue.
10921	13	19	13	Be strong! Let’s fight bravely for the sake of our people and the cities of our God! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will do what he decides is best!”
10922	13	19	14	So Joab and his men marched toward the Arameans to do battle, and they fled before him.
10923	13	19	15	When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they fled before Joab’s brother Abishai and withdrew into the city. Joab went back to Jerusalem.
10924	13	19	16	¶When the Arameans realized they had been defeated by Israel, they sent for reinforcements from beyond the Euphrates River, led by Shophach the commanding general of Hadadezer’s army.
10925	13	19	17	When David was informed, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and marched against them. David deployed his army against the Arameans for battle and they fought against him.
10926	13	19	18	The Arameans fled before Israel. David killed 7,000 Aramean charioteers and 40,000 infantrymen; he also killed Shophach the commanding general.
10927	13	19	19	When Hadadezer’s subjects saw they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. The Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.
10928	13	20	1	¶In the spring, at the time when kings normally conduct wars, Joab led the army into battle and devastated the land of the Ammonites. He went and besieged Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab defeated Rabbah and tore it down.
10929	13	20	2	David took the crown from the head of their king and wore it (its weight was a talent of gold and it was set with precious stones). He took a large amount of plunder from the city.
10930	13	20	3	He removed the city’s residents and made them labor with saws, iron picks, and axes. This was his policy with all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.
10931	13	20	4	¶Later there was a battle with the Philistines in Gezer. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued.
10932	13	20	5	¶There was another battle with the Philistines in which Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear had a shaft as big as the crossbeam of a weaver’s loom.
10933	13	20	6	¶In a battle in Gath there was a large man who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot – twenty-four in all! He too was a descendant of Rapha.
10934	13	20	7	When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.
10935	13	20	8	¶These were the descendants of Rapha who lived in Gath; they were killed by the hand of David and his soldiers.
10936	13	21	1	¶An adversary opposed Israel, inciting David to count how many warriors Israel had.
10937	13	21	2	David told Joab and the leaders of the army, “Go, count the number of warriors from Beer Sheba to Dan. Then bring back a report to me so I may know how many we have.”
10938	13	21	3	Joab replied, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> make his army a hundred times larger! My master, O king, do not all of them serve my master? Why does my master want to do this? Why bring judgment on Israel?”
10939	13	21	4	¶But the king’s edict stood, despite Joab’s objections. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel before returning to Jerusalem.
10940	13	21	5	Joab reported to David the number of warriors. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 sword-wielding soldiers; Judah alone had 470,000 sword-wielding soldiers.
10941	13	21	6	Now Joab did not number Levi and Benjamin, for the king’s edict disgusted him.
10942	13	21	7	God was also offended by it, so he attacked Israel.
10943	13	21	8	¶David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by doing this! Now, please remove the guilt of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
10944	13	21	9	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Gad, David’s prophet,
10945	13	21	10	“Go, tell David, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: “I am offering you three forms of judgment from which to choose. Pick one of them.”’”
10946	13	21	11	Gad went to David and told him, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‘Pick one of these:
10947	13	21	12	three years of famine, or three months being chased by your enemies and struck down by their swords, or three days being struck down by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, during which a plague will invade the land and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel will destroy throughout Israel’s territory.’ Now, decide what I should tell the one who sent me.”
10948	13	21	13	David said to Gad, “I am very upset! I prefer to be attacked by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for his mercy is very great; I do not want to be attacked by men!”
10949	13	21	14	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent a plague through Israel, and 70,000 Israelite men died.
10950	13	21	15	¶God sent an angel to ravage Jerusalem. As he was doing so, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> watched and relented from his judgment. He told the angel who was destroying, “That’s enough! Stop now!” ¶Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel was standing near the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
10951	13	21	16	David looked up and saw the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel standing between the earth and sky with his sword drawn and in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. David and the leaders, covered with sackcloth, threw themselves down with their faces to the ground.
10952	13	21	17	David said to God, “Was I not the one who decided to number the army? I am the one who sinned and committed this awful deed! As for these sheep – what have they done? O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God, attack me and my family, but remove the plague from your people!”
10953	13	21	18	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel told Gad to instruct David to go up and build an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
10954	13	21	19	So David went up as Gad instructed him to do in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
10955	13	21	20	While Ornan was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the messenger, and he and his four sons hid themselves.
10956	13	21	21	When David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David; he came out from the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground.
10957	13	21	22	David said to Ornan, “Sell me the threshing floor so I can build on it an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – I’ll pay top price – so that the plague may be removed from the people.”
10958	13	21	23	Ornan told David, “You can have it! My master, the king, may do what he wants. Look, I am giving you the oxen for burnt sacrifices, the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for an offering. I give it all to you.”
10959	13	21	24	King David replied to Ornan, “No, I insist on buying it for top price. I will not offer to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> what belongs to you or offer a burnt sacrifice that cost me nothing.
10960	13	21	25	So David bought the place from Ornan for 600 pieces of gold.
10961	13	21	26	David built there an altar to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings. He called out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responded by sending fire from the sky and consuming the burnt sacrifice on the altar.
10962	13	21	27	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> ordered the messenger to put his sword back into its sheath.
10963	13	21	28	¶At that time, when David saw that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responded to him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.
10964	13	21	29	Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s tabernacle (which Moses had made in the wilderness) and the altar for burnt sacrifices were at that time at the worship center in Gibeon.
10965	13	21	30	But David could not go before it to seek God’s will, for he was afraid of the sword of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel.
10966	13	22	1	David then said, “This is the place where the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God will be, along with the altar for burnt sacrifices for Israel.”
10967	13	22	2	¶David ordered the resident foreigners in the land of Israel to be called together. He appointed some of them to be stonecutters to chisel stones for the building of God’s temple.
10968	13	22	3	David supplied a large amount of iron for the nails of the doors of the gates and for braces, more bronze than could be weighed,
10969	13	22	4	and more cedar logs than could be counted. (The Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large amount of cedar logs to David.)
10970	13	22	5	¶David said, “My son Solomon is just an inexperienced young man, and the temple to be built for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> must be especially magnificent so it will become famous and be considered splendid by all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for its construction.” So David made extensive preparations before he died.
10971	13	22	6	¶He summoned his son Solomon and charged him to build a temple for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
10972	13	22	7	David said to Solomon: “My son, I really wanted to build a temple to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God.
10973	13	22	8	But this was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’s</span> message to me: ‘You have spilled a great deal of blood and fought many battles. You must not build a temple to honor me, for you have spilled a great deal of blood on the ground before me.
10974	13	22	9	Look, you will have a son, who will be a peaceful man. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. Indeed, Solomon will be his name; I will give Israel peace and quiet during his reign.
10975	13	22	10	He will build a temple to honor me; he will become my son, and I will become his father. I will grant to his dynasty permanent rule over Israel.’
10976	13	22	11	¶“Now, my son, may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> be with you! May you succeed and build a temple for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, just as he announced you would.
10977	13	22	12	Only may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> give you insight and understanding when he places you in charge of Israel, so you may obey the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
10978	13	22	13	Then you will succeed, if you carefully obey the rules and regulations which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> ordered Moses to give to Israel. Be strong and brave! Don’t be afraid and don’t panic!
10979	13	22	14	Now, look, I have made every effort to supply what is needed to build the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. I have stored up 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and so much bronze and iron it cannot be weighed, as well as wood and stones. Feel free to add more!
10980	13	22	15	You also have available many workers, including stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and an innumerable array of workers who are skilled
10981	13	22	16	in using gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Get up and begin the work! May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> be with you!”
10982	13	22	17	¶David ordered all the officials of Israel to support his son Solomon.
10983	13	22	18	He told them, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is with you! He has made you secure on every side, for he handed over to me the inhabitants of the region and the region is subdued before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and his people.
10984	13	22	19	Now seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God wholeheartedly and with your entire being! Get up and build the sanctuary of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God! Then you can bring the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant and the holy items dedicated to God’s service into the temple that is built to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
10985	13	23	1	¶When David was old and approaching the end of his life, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
10986	13	23	2	¶David assembled all the leaders of Israel, along with the priests and the Levites.
10987	13	23	3	The Levites who were thirty years old and up were counted; there were 38,000 men.
10988	13	23	4	David said, “Of these, 24,000 are to direct the work of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple; 6,000 are to be officials and judges;
10989	13	23	5	4,000 are to be gatekeepers; and 4,000 are to praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with the instruments I supplied for worship.”
10990	13	23	6	David divided them into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
10991	13	23	7	¶The Gershonites included Ladan and Shimei.
10992	13	23	8	¶The sons of Ladan:¶Jehiel the oldest, Zetham, and Joel – three in all.
10993	13	23	9	¶The sons of Shimei:¶Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran – three in all.¶These were the leaders of the family of Ladan.
10994	13	23	10	¶The sons of Shimei:¶Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These were Shimei’s sons – four in all.
10995	13	23	11	Jahath was the oldest and Zizah the second oldest. Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were considered one family with one responsibility.
10996	13	23	12	¶The sons of Kohath:¶Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel – four in all.
10997	13	23	13	¶The sons of Amram:¶Aaron and Moses.¶Aaron and his descendants were chosen on a permanent basis to consecrate the most holy items, to offer sacrifices before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, to serve him, and to praise his name.
10998	13	23	14	The descendants of Moses the man of God were considered Levites.
10999	13	23	15	¶The sons of Moses:¶Gershom and Eliezer.
11000	13	23	16	¶The son of Gershom:¶Shebuel the oldest.
11001	13	23	17	¶The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah, the oldest. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many descendants.
11002	13	23	18	¶The son of Izhar:¶Shelomith the oldest.
11003	13	23	19	¶The sons of Hebron:¶Jeriah the oldest, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
11004	13	23	20	¶The sons of Uzziel:¶Micah the oldest, and Isshiah the second.
11005	13	23	21	¶The sons of Merari:¶Mahli and Mushi.¶The sons of Mahli:¶Eleazar and Kish.
11006	13	23	22	¶Eleazar died without having sons; he had only daughters. The sons of Kish, their cousins, married them.
11007	13	23	23	¶The sons of Mushi:¶Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth – three in all.
11008	13	23	24	¶These were the descendants of Levi according to their families, that is, the leaders of families as counted and individually listed who carried out assigned tasks in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and were twenty years old and up.
11009	13	23	25	For David said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has given his people rest and has permanently settled in Jerusalem.
11010	13	23	26	So the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the items used in its service.”
11011	13	23	27	According to David’s final instructions, the Levites twenty years old and up were counted.
11012	13	23	28	¶Their job was to help Aaron’s descendants in the service of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. They were to take care of the courtyards, the rooms, ceremonial purification of all holy items, and other jobs related to the service of God’s temple.
11013	13	23	29	They also took care of the bread that is displayed, the flour for offerings, the unleavened wafers, the round cakes, the mixing, and all the measuring.
11014	13	23	30	They also stood in a designated place every morning and offered thanks and praise to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They also did this in the evening
11015	13	23	31	and whenever burnt sacrifices were offered to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on the Sabbath and at new moon festivals and assemblies. A designated number were to serve before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> regularly in accordance with regulations.
11016	13	23	32	They were in charge of the meeting tent and the holy place, and helped their relatives, the descendants of Aaron, in the service of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11017	13	24	1	¶The divisions of Aaron’s descendants were as follows:¶The sons of Aaron:¶Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
11018	13	24	2	¶Nadab and Abihu died before their father did; they had no sons. Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
11019	13	24	3	¶David, Zadok (a descendant of Eleazar), and Ahimelech (a descendant of Ithamar) divided them into groups to carry out their assigned responsibilities.
11020	13	24	4	The descendants of Eleazar had more leaders than the descendants of Ithamar, so they divided them up accordingly; the descendants of Eleazar had sixteen leaders, while the descendants of Ithamar had eight.
11021	13	24	5	They divided them by lots, for there were officials of the holy place and officials designated by God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.
11022	13	24	6	The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, wrote down their names before the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the priestly and Levite families. One family was drawn by lot from Eleazar, and then the next from Ithamar.
11023	13	24	7	¶The first lot went to Jehoiarib,¶the second to Jedaiah,
11024	13	24	8	¶the third to Harim,¶the fourth to Seorim,
11025	13	24	9	¶the fifth to Malkijah,¶the sixth to Mijamin,
11026	13	24	10	¶the seventh to Hakkoz,¶the eighth to Abijah,
11027	13	24	11	¶the ninth to Jeshua,¶the tenth to Shecaniah,
11028	13	24	12	¶the eleventh to Eliashib,¶the twelfth to Jakim,
11029	13	24	13	¶the thirteenth to Huppah,¶the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
11030	13	24	14	¶the fifteenth to Bilgah,¶the sixteenth to Immer,
11031	13	24	15	¶the seventeenth to Hezir,¶the eighteenth to Happizzez,
11032	13	24	16	¶the nineteenth to Pethahiah,¶the twentieth to Jehezkel,
11033	13	24	17	¶the twenty-first to Jakin,¶the twenty-second to Gamul,
11034	13	24	18	¶the twenty-third to Delaiah,¶the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
11035	13	24	19	¶This was the order in which they carried out their assigned responsibilities when they entered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, according to the regulations given them by their ancestor Aaron, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel had instructed him.
11036	13	24	20	¶The rest of the Levites included: ¶Shubael from the sons of Amram,¶Jehdeiah from the sons of Shubael,
11037	13	24	21	¶the firstborn Isshiah from Rehabiah and the sons of Rehabiah,
11038	13	24	22	¶Shelomoth from the Izharites,¶Jahath from the sons of Shelomoth.
11039	13	24	23	¶The sons of Hebron: ¶Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
11040	13	24	24	¶The son of Uzziel:¶Micah;¶Shamir from the sons of Micah.
11041	13	24	25	¶The brother of Micah:¶Isshiah.¶Zechariah from the sons of Isshiah.
11042	13	24	26	¶The sons of Merari:¶Mahli and Mushi.¶The son of Jaaziah:¶Beno.
11043	13	24	27	¶The sons of Merari, from Jaaziah:¶Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
11044	13	24	28	¶From Mahli:¶Eleazar, who had no sons.
11045	13	24	29	¶From Kish:¶Jerahmeel.
11046	13	24	30	¶The sons of Mushi:¶Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.¶These were the Levites, listed by their families.
11047	13	24	31	¶Just like their relatives, the descendants of Aaron, they also cast lots before King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, the leaders of families, the priests, and the Levites. The families of the oldest son cast lots along with those of the youngest.
11048	13	25	1	¶David and the army officers selected some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to prophesy as they played stringed instruments and cymbals. The following men were assigned this responsibility:
11049	13	25	2	¶From the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah. The sons of Asaph were supervised by Asaph, who prophesied under the king’s supervision.
11050	13	25	3	¶From the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah – six in all, under supervision of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied as he played a harp, giving thanks and praise to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11051	13	25	4	¶From the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
11052	13	25	5	All these were the sons of Heman, the king’s prophet. God had promised him these sons in order to make him prestigious. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
11053	13	25	6	¶All of these were under the supervision of their fathers; they were musicians in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, playing cymbals and stringed instruments as they served in God’s temple. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the supervision of the king.
11054	13	25	7	They and their relatives, all of them skilled and trained to make music to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, numbered two hundred eighty-eight.
11055	13	25	8	¶They cast lots to determine their responsibilities – oldest as well as youngest, teacher as well as student.
11056	13	25	9	¶The first lot went to Asaph’s son Joseph and his relatives and sons – twelve in all, ¶the second to Gedaliah and his relatives and sons – twelve in all,
11057	13	25	10	¶the third to Zaccur and his sons and relatives – twelve in all,
11058	13	25	11	¶the fourth to Izri and his sons and relatives – twelve in all,
11059	13	25	12	¶the fifth to Nethaniah and his sons and relatives – twelve in all,
11060	13	25	13	¶the sixth to Bukkiah and his sons and relatives – twelve in all,

11146	13	28	2	¶King David rose to his feet and said: “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I wanted to build a temple where the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant could be placed as a footstool for our God. I have made the preparations for building it.
11147	13	28	3	But God said to me, ‘You must not build a temple to honor me, for you are a warrior and have spilled blood.’
11148	13	28	4	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel chose me out of my father’s entire family to become king over Israel and have a permanent dynasty. Indeed, he chose Judah as leader, and my father’s family within Judah, and then he picked me out from among my father’s sons and made me king over all Israel.
11149	13	28	5	From all the many sons the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given me, he chose Solomon my son to rule on his behalf over Israel.
11150	13	28	6	He said to me, ‘Solomon your son is the one who will build my temple and my courts, for I have chosen him to become my son and I will become his father.
11151	13	28	7	I will establish his kingdom permanently, if he remains committed to obeying my commands and regulations, as you are doing this day.’
11152	13	28	8	So now, in the sight of all Israel, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s assembly, and in the hearing of our God, I say this: Carefully observe all the commands of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, so that you may possess this good land and may leave it as a permanent inheritance for your children after you.
11153	13	28	9	¶“And you, Solomon my son, obey the God of your father and serve him with a submissive attitude and a willing spirit, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> examines all minds and understands every motive of one’s thoughts. If you seek him, he will let you find him, but if you abandon him, he will reject you permanently.
11154	13	28	10	Realize now that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has chosen you to build a temple as his sanctuary. Be strong and do it!”
11155	13	28	11	¶David gave to his son Solomon the blueprints for the temple porch, its buildings, its treasuries, its upper areas, its inner rooms, and the room for atonement.
11156	13	28	12	He gave him the blueprints of all he envisioned for the courts of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, all the surrounding rooms, the storehouses of God’s temple, and the storehouses for the holy items.
11157	13	28	13	¶He gave him the regulations for the divisions of priests and Levites, for all the assigned responsibilities within the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, and for all the items used in the service of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11158	13	28	14	¶He gave him the prescribed weight for all the gold items to be used in various types of service in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, for all the silver items to be used in various types of service,
11159	13	28	15	for the gold lampstands and their gold lamps, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps, for the silver lampstands, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps, according to the prescribed use of each lampstand,
11160	13	28	16	for the gold used in the display tables, including the amount to be used in each table, for the silver to be used in the silver tables,
11161	13	28	17	for the pure gold used for the meat forks, bowls, and jars, for the small gold bowls, including the weight for each bowl, for the small silver bowls, including the weight for each bowl,
11162	13	28	18	and for the refined gold of the incense altar.¶He gave him the blueprint for the seat of the gold cherubim that spread their wings and provide shelter for the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant.
11163	13	28	19	¶David said, “All of this I put in writing as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> directed me and gave me insight regarding the details of the blueprints.”
11164	13	28	20	¶David said to his son Solomon: “Be strong and brave! Do it! Don’t be afraid and don’t panic! For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God, my God, is with you. He will not leave you or abandon you before all the work for the service of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple is finished.
11165	13	28	21	Here are the divisions of the priests and Levites who will perform all the service of God’s temple. All the willing and skilled men are ready to assist you in all the work and perform their service. The officials and all the people are ready to follow your instructions.”
11166	13	29	1	¶King David said to the entire assembly: “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is just an inexperienced young man, and the task is great, for this palace is not for man, but for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God.
11167	13	29	2	So I have made every effort to provide what is needed for the temple of my God, including the gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, as well as a large amount of onyx, settings of antimony and other stones, all kinds of precious stones, and alabaster.
11168	13	29	3	Now, to show my commitment to the temple of my God, I donate my personal treasure of gold and silver to the temple of my God, in addition to all that I have already supplied for this holy temple.
11169	13	29	4	This includes 3,000 talents of gold from Ophir and 7,000 talents of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the buildings,
11170	13	29	5	for gold and silver items, and for all the work of the craftsmen. Who else wants to contribute to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> today?”
11171	13	29	6	¶The leaders of the families, the leaders of the Israelite tribes, the commanders of units of a thousand and a hundred, and the supervisors of the king’s work contributed willingly.
11172	13	29	7	They donated for the service of God’s temple 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze, and 100,000 talents of iron.
11173	13	29	8	All who possessed precious stones donated them to the treasury of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, which was under the supervision of Jehiel the Gershonite.
11174	13	29	9	The people were delighted with their donations, for they contributed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with a willing attitude; King David was also very happy.
11175	13	29	10	¶David praised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> before the entire assembly: ¶“O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of our father Israel, you deserve praise forevermore!
11176	13	29	11	O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you are great, mighty, majestic, magnificent, glorious, and sovereign over all the sky and earth! You, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> have dominion and exalt yourself as the ruler of all.
11177	13	29	12	You are the source of wealth and honor; you rule over all. You possess strength and might to magnify and give strength to all.
11178	13	29	13	Now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise your majestic name!
11179	13	29	14	¶“But who am I and who are my people, that we should be in a position to contribute this much? Indeed, everything comes from you, and we have simply given back to you what is yours.
11180	13	29	15	For we are resident foreigners and temporary settlers in your presence, like all our ancestors; our days are like a shadow on the earth, without security.
11181	13	29	16	O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, all this wealth, which we have collected to build a temple for you to honor your holy name, comes from you; it all belongs to you.
11182	13	29	17	I know, my God, that you examine thoughts and are pleased with integrity. With pure motives I contribute all this; and now I look with joy as your people who have gathered here contribute to you.
11183	13	29	18	O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, always maintain these motives of your people and keep them devoted to you.
11184	13	29	19	Make my son Solomon willing to obey your commands, rules, and regulations, and to complete building the palace for which I have made preparations.”
11185	13	29	20	¶David told the entire assembly: “Praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God!” So the entire assembly praised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors; they bowed down and stretched out flat on the ground before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and the king.
11186	13	29	21	¶The next day they made sacrifices and offered burnt sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> (1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, 1,000 lambs), along with their accompanying drink offerings and many other sacrifices for all Israel.
11187	13	29	22	They held a feast before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that day and celebrated. ¶Then they designated Solomon, David’s son, as king a second time; before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> they anointed him as ruler and Zadok as priest.
11188	13	29	23	Solomon sat on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s throne as king in place of his father David; he was successful and all Israel was loyal to him.
11189	13	29	24	All the officers and warriors, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
11190	13	29	25	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> greatly magnified Solomon before all Israel and bestowed on him greater majesty than any king of Israel before him.
11191	13	29	26	¶David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
11192	13	29	27	He reigned over Israel forty years; he reigned in Hebron seven years and in Jerusalem thirty-three years.
11193	13	29	28	He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth, and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him.
11194	13	29	29	King David’s accomplishments, from start to finish, are recorded in the Annals of Samuel the prophet, the Annals of Nathan the prophet, and the Annals of Gad the prophet.
11195	13	29	30	Recorded there are all the facts about his reign and accomplishments, and an account of the events that involved him, Israel, and all the neighboring kingdoms.
11196	14	1	1	¶Solomon son of David solidified his royal authority, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God was with him and magnified him greatly.
11197	14	1	2	¶Solomon addressed all Israel, including those who commanded units of a thousand and a hundred, the judges, and all the leaders of all Israel who were heads of families.
11198	14	1	3	Solomon and the entire assembly went to the worship center in Gibeon, for the tent where they met God was located there, which Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant had made in the wilderness.
11199	14	1	4	(Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
11200	14	1	5	But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, was in front of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s tabernacle. Solomon and the entire assembly prayed to him there.)
11201	14	1	6	Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> which was at the meeting tent, and he offered up a thousand burnt sacrifices.
11202	14	1	7	¶That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Tell me what I should give you.”
11203	14	1	8	Solomon replied to God, “You demonstrated great loyalty to my father David and have made me king in his place.
11204	14	1	9	Now, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God, may your promise to my father David be realized, for you have made me king over a great nation as numerous as the dust of the earth.
11205	14	1	10	Now give me wisdom and discernment so I can effectively lead this nation. Otherwise no one is able to make judicial decisions for this great nation of yours.”
11206	14	1	11	¶God said to Solomon, “Because you desire this, and did not ask for riches, wealth, and honor, or for vengeance on your enemies, and because you did not ask for long life, but requested wisdom and discernment so you can make judicial decisions for my people over whom I have made you king,
11207	14	1	12	you are granted wisdom and discernment. Furthermore I am giving you riches, wealth, and honor surpassing that of any king before or after you.”
11208	14	1	13	¶Solomon left the meeting tent at the worship center in Gibeon and went to Jerusalem, where he reigned over Israel.
11209	14	1	14	¶Solomon accumulated chariots and horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses . He kept them in assigned cities and in Jerusalem.
11210	14	1	15	The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones; cedar was as plentiful as sycamore fig trees are in the foothills.
11211	14	1	16	Solomon acquired his horses from Egypt and from Que; the king’s traders purchased them from Que.
11212	14	1	17	They paid 600 silver pieces for each chariot from Egypt, and 150 silver pieces for each horse. They also sold chariots and horses to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Syria.
11213	14	2	1	¶(1:18) Solomon ordered a temple to be built to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, as well as a royal palace for himself.
11214	14	2	2	(2:1) Solomon had 70,000 common laborers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hills, in addition to 3,600 supervisors.
11215	14	2	3	¶Solomon sent a message to King Huram of Tyre: “Help me as you did my father David, when you sent him cedar logs for the construction of his palace.
11216	14	2	4	Look, I am ready to build a temple to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God and to dedicate it to him in order to burn fragrant incense before him, to set out the bread that is regularly displayed, and to offer burnt sacrifices each morning and evening, and on Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and at other times appointed by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God. This is something Israel must do on a permanent basis.
11217	14	2	5	I will build a great temple, for our God is greater than all gods.
11218	14	2	6	Of course, who can really build a temple for him, since the sky and the highest heavens cannot contain him? Who am I that I should build him a temple! It will really be only a place to offer sacrifices before him.
11219	14	2	7	¶“Now send me a man who is skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as purple, crimson, and blue colored fabrics, and who knows how to engrave. He will work with my skilled craftsmen here in Jerusalem and Judah, whom my father David provided.
11220	14	2	8	Send me cedars, evergreens, and algum trees from Lebanon, for I know your servants are adept at cutting down trees in Lebanon. My servants will work with your servants
11221	14	2	9	to supply me with large quantities of timber, for I am building a great, magnificent temple.
11222	14	2	10	Look, I will pay your servants who cut the timber 20,000 cors of ground wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 120,000 gallons of wine, and 120,000 gallons of olive oil.”
11223	14	2	11	¶King Huram of Tyre sent this letter to Solomon: “Because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> loves his people, he has made you their king.”
11224	14	2	12	Huram also said, “Worthy of praise is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, who made the sky and the earth! He has given King David a wise son who has discernment and insight and will build a temple for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, as well as a royal palace for himself.
11225	14	2	13	Now I am sending you Huram Abi, a skilled and capable man,
11226	14	2	14	whose mother is a Danite and whose father is a Tyrian. He knows how to work with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stones, and wood, as well as purple, blue, white, and crimson fabrics. He knows how to do all kinds of engraving and understands any design given to him. He will work with your skilled craftsmen and the skilled craftsmen of my lord David your father.
11227	14	2	15	Now let my lord send to his servants the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine he has promised;
11228	14	2	16	we will get all the timber you need from Lebanon and bring it in raft-like bundles by sea to Joppa. You can then haul it on up to Jerusalem.”
11229	14	2	17	¶Solomon took a census of all the male resident foreigners in the land of Israel, after the census his father David had taken. There were 153,600 in all.
11230	14	2	18	He designated 70,000 as common laborers, 80,000 as stonecutters in the hills, and 3,600 as supervisors to make sure the people completed the work.
11231	14	3	1	¶Solomon began building the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had appeared to his father David. This was the place that David prepared at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
11232	14	3	2	He began building on the second day of the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
11233	14	3	3	¶Solomon laid the foundation for God’s temple; its length (determined according to the old standard of measure) was 90 feet, and its width 30 feet.
11234	14	3	4	The porch in front of the main hall was 30 feet long, corresponding to the width of the temple, and its height was 30 feet. He plated the inside with pure gold.
11235	14	3	5	He paneled the main hall with boards made from evergreen trees and plated it with fine gold, decorated with palm trees and chains.
11236	14	3	6	He decorated the temple with precious stones; the gold he used came from Parvaim.
11237	14	3	7	He overlaid the temple’s rafters, thresholds, walls and doors with gold; he carved decorative cherubim on the walls.
11238	14	3	8	¶He made the most holy place; its length was 30 feet, corresponding to the width of the temple, and its width 30 feet. He plated it with 600 talents of fine gold.
11239	14	3	9	The gold nails weighed 50 shekels; he also plated the upper areas with gold.
11240	14	3	10	In the most holy place he made two images of cherubim and plated them with gold.
11241	14	3	11	The combined wing span of the cherubim was 30 feet. One of the first cherub’s wings was seven and one-half feet long and touched one wall of the temple; its other wing was also seven and one-half feet long and touched one of the second cherub’s wings.
11242	14	3	12	Likewise one of the second cherub’s wings was seven and one-half feet long and touched the other wall of the temple; its other wing was also seven and one-half feet long and touched one of the first cherub’s wings.
11243	14	3	13	The combined wingspan of these cherubim was 30 feet. They stood upright, facing inward.
11244	14	3	14	He made the curtain out of blue, purple, crimson, and white fabrics, and embroidered on it decorative cherubim.
11245	14	3	15	¶In front of the temple he made two pillars which had a combined length of 52½ feet, with each having a plated capital seven and one-half feet high.
11246	14	3	16	He made ornamental chains and put them on top of the pillars. He also made one hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments and arranged them within the chains.
11247	14	3	17	He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right side and the other on the left. He named the one on the right Yakin, and the one on the left Boaz.
11248	14	4	1	¶He made a bronze altar, 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet high.
11249	14	4	2	He also made the big bronze basin called “The Sea.” It measured 15 feet from rim to rim, was circular in shape, and stood seven and one-half feet high. Its circumference was 45 feet.
11250	14	4	3	Images of bulls were under it all the way around, ten every eighteen inches all the way around. The bulls were in two rows and had been cast with “The Sea.”
11251	14	4	4	“The Sea” stood on top of twelve bulls. Three faced northward, three westward, three southward, and three eastward. “The Sea” was placed on top of them, and they all faced outward.
11252	14	4	5	It was four fingers thick and its rim was like that of a cup shaped like a lily blossom. It could hold 18,000 gallons.
11253	14	4	6	He made ten washing basins; he put five on the south side and five on the north side. In them they rinsed the items used for burnt sacrifices; the priests washed in “The Sea.”
11254	14	4	7	¶He made ten gold lampstands according to specifications and put them in the temple, five on the right and five on the left.
11255	14	4	8	He made ten tables and set them in the temple, five on the right and five on the left. He also made one hundred gold bowls.
11256	14	4	9	He made the courtyard of the priests and the large enclosure and its doors; he plated their doors with bronze.
11257	14	4	10	He put “The Sea” on the south side, in the southeast corner.
11258	14	4	11	¶Huram Abi made the pots, shovels, and bowls. He finished all the work on God’s temple he had been assigned by King Solomon.
11259	14	4	12	He made the two pillars, the two bowl-shaped tops of the pillars, the latticework for the bowl-shaped tops of the two pillars,
11260	14	4	13	the four hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments for the latticework of the two pillars (each latticework had two rows of these ornaments at the bowl-shaped top of the pillar),
11261	14	4	14	the ten movable stands with their ten basins,
11262	14	4	15	the big bronze basin called “The Sea” with its twelve bulls underneath,
11263	14	4	16	and the pots, shovels, and meat forks. All the items King Solomon assigned Huram Abi to make for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple were made from polished bronze.
11264	14	4	17	The king had them cast in earth foundries in the region of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.
11265	14	4	18	Solomon made so many of these items they did not weigh the bronze.
11266	14	4	19	¶Solomon also made these items for God’s temple: the gold altar, the tables on which the Bread of the Presence was kept,
11267	14	4	20	the pure gold lampstands and their lamps which burned as specified at the entrance to the inner sanctuary,
11268	14	4	21	the pure gold flower-shaped ornaments, lamps, and tongs,
11269	14	4	22	the pure gold trimming shears, basins, pans, and censers, and the gold door sockets for the inner sanctuary (the most holy place) and for the doors of the main hall of the temple.
11270	14	5	1	When Solomon had finished constructing the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, he put the holy items that belonged to his father David (the silver, gold, and all the other articles) in the treasuries of God’s temple.
11271	14	5	2	¶Then Solomon convened Israel’s elders – all the leaders of the Israelite tribes and families – in Jerusalem, so they could witness the transferal of the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from the City of David (that is, Zion).
11272	14	5	3	All the men of Israel assembled before the king during the festival in the seventh month.
11273	14	5	4	When all Israel’s elders had arrived, the Levites lifted the ark.
11274	14	5	5	The priests and Levites carried the ark, the tent where God appeared to his people, and all the holy items in the tent.
11275	14	5	6	Now King Solomon and all the Israelites who had assembled with him went on ahead of the ark and sacrificed more sheep and cattle than could be counted or numbered.
11276	14	5	7	¶The priests brought the ark of the covenant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to its assigned place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, in the most holy place under the wings of the cherubim.
11277	14	5	8	The cherubim’s wings extended over the place where the ark sat; the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles.
11278	14	5	9	The poles were so long their ends extending out from the ark were visible from in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from beyond that point. They have remained there to this very day.
11279	14	5	10	There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets Moses had placed there in Horeb. (It was there that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made a covenant with the Israelites after he brought them out of the land of Egypt.)
11280	14	5	11	¶The priests left the holy place. All the priests who participated had consecrated themselves, no matter which division they represented.
11281	14	5	12	All the Levites who were musicians, including Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives, wore linen. They played cymbals and stringed instruments as they stood east of the altar. They were accompanied by 120 priests who blew trumpets.
11282	14	5	13	The trumpeters and musicians played together, praising and giving thanks to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, they loudly praised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, singing: “Certainly he is good; certainly his loyal love endures!” Then a cloud filled the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11283	14	5	14	The priests could not carry out their duties because of the cloud; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s splendor filled God’s temple.
11284	14	6	1	¶Then Solomon said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said that he lives in thick darkness.
11285	14	6	2	O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I have built a lofty temple for you, a place where you can live permanently.”
11286	14	6	3	Then the king turned around and pronounced a blessing over the whole Israelite assembly as they stood there.
11287	14	6	4	He said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel is worthy of praise because he has fulfilled what he promised my father David.
11288	14	6	5	He told David, ‘Since the day I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a temple in which to live. Nor did I choose a man as leader of my people Israel.
11289	14	6	6	But now I have chosen Jerusalem as a place to live, and I have chosen David to lead my people Israel.’
11290	14	6	7	Now my father David had a strong desire to build a temple to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
11291	14	6	8	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told my father David, ‘It is right for you to have a strong desire to build a temple to honor me.
11292	14	6	9	But you will not build the temple; your very own son will build the temple for my honor.’
11293	14	6	10	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has kept the promise he made. I have taken my father David’s place and have occupied the throne of Israel, as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised. I have built this temple for the honor of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel
11294	14	6	11	and set up in it a place for the ark containing the covenant the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made with the Israelites.”
11295	14	6	12	¶He stood before the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in front of the entire assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
11296	14	6	13	Solomon had made a bronze platform and had placed it in the middle of the enclosure. It was seven and one-half feet long, seven and one-half feet wide, and four and one-half feet high. He stood on it and then got down on his knees in front of the entire assembly of Israel. He spread out his hands toward the sky,
11297	14	6	14	and prayed: “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven or on earth! You maintain covenantal loyalty to your servants who obey you with sincerity.
11298	14	6	15	You have kept your word to your servant, my father David; this very day you have fulfilled what you promised.
11299	14	6	16	Now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, keep the promise you made to your servant, my father David, when you said, ‘You will never fail to have a successor ruling before me on the throne of Israel, provided that your descendants watch their step and obey my law as you have done.’
11300	14	6	17	Now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, may the promise you made to your servant David be realized.
11301	14	6	18	¶“God does not really live with humankind on the earth! Look, if the sky and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this temple I have built!
11302	14	6	19	But respond favorably to your servant’s prayer and his request for help, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God. Answer the desperate prayer your servant is presenting to you.
11303	14	6	20	Night and day may you watch over this temple, the place where you promised you would live. May you answer your servant’s prayer for this place.
11304	14	6	21	Respond to the requests of your servant and your people Israel for this place. Hear from your heavenly dwelling place and respond favorably and forgive.
11305	14	6	22	¶“When someone is accused of sinning against his neighbor and the latter pronounces a curse on the alleged offender before your altar in this temple,
11306	14	6	23	listen from heaven and make a just decision about your servants’ claims. Condemn the guilty party, declare the other innocent, and give both of them what they deserve.
11307	14	6	24	¶“If your people Israel are defeated by an enemy because they sinned against you, then if they come back to you, renew their allegiance to you, and pray for your help before you in this temple,
11308	14	6	25	then listen from heaven, forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their ancestors.
11309	14	6	26	¶“The time will come when the skies are shut up tightly and no rain falls because your people sinned against you. When they direct their prayers toward this place, renew their allegiance to you, and turn away from their sin because you punish them,
11310	14	6	27	then listen from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Certainly you will then teach them the right way to live and send rain on your land that you have given your people to possess.
11311	14	6	28	¶“The time will come when the land suffers from a famine, a plague, blight, and disease, or a locust invasion, or when their enemy lays siege to the cities of the land, or when some other type of plague or epidemic occurs.
11312	14	6	29	When all your people Israel pray and ask for help, as they acknowledge their intense pain and spread out their hands toward this temple,
11313	14	6	30	then listen from your heavenly dwelling place, forgive their sin, and act favorably toward each one based on your evaluation of their motives. (Indeed you are the only one who can correctly evaluate the motives of all people.)
11314	14	6	31	Then they will honor you by obeying you throughout their lifetimes as they live on the land you gave to our ancestors.
11315	14	6	32	¶“Foreigners, who do not belong to your people Israel, will come from a distant land because of your great reputation and your ability to accomplish mighty deeds; they will come and direct their prayers toward this temple.
11316	14	6	33	Then listen from your heavenly dwelling place and answer all the prayers of the foreigners. Then all the nations of the earth will acknowledge your reputation, obey you like your people Israel do, and recognize that this temple I built belongs to you.
11317	14	6	34	¶“When you direct your people to march out and fight their enemies, and they direct their prayers to you toward this chosen city and this temple I built for your honor,
11318	14	6	35	then listen from heaven to their prayers for help and vindicate them.
11319	14	6	36	¶“The time will come when your people will sin against you (for there is no one who is sinless!) and you will be angry at them and deliver them over to their enemies, who will take them as prisoners to their land, whether far away or close by.
11320	14	6	37	When your people come to their senses in the land where they are held prisoner, they will repent and beg for your mercy in the land of their imprisonment, admitting, ‘We have sinned and gone astray , we have done evil!’
11321	14	6	38	When they return to you with all their heart and being in the land where they are held prisoner and direct their prayers toward the land you gave to their ancestors, your chosen city, and the temple I built for your honor,
11322	14	6	39	then listen from your heavenly dwelling place to their prayers for help, vindicate them, and forgive your sinful people.
11323	14	6	40	¶“Now, my God, may you be attentive and responsive to the prayers offered in this place.
11324	14	6	41	Now ascend, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God, to your resting place, you and the ark of your strength! May your priests, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God, experience your deliverance! May your loyal followers rejoice in the prosperity you give!
11325	14	6	42	O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God, do not reject your chosen ones! Remember the faithful promises you made to your servant David!”
11326	14	7	1	¶When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s splendor filled the temple.
11327	14	7	2	The priests were unable to enter the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s splendor filled the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11328	14	7	3	When all the Israelites saw the fire come down and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s splendor over the temple, they got on their knees with their faces downward toward the pavement. They worshiped and gave thanks to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, saying, “Certainly he is good; certainly his loyal love endures!”
11329	14	7	4	¶The king and all the people were presenting sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11330	14	7	5	King Solomon sacrificed 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. Then the king and all the people dedicated God’s temple.
11331	14	7	6	The priests stood in their assigned spots, along with the Levites who had the musical instruments used for praising the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. (These were the ones King David made for giving thanks to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and which were used by David when he offered praise, saying, “Certainly his loyal love endures.”) Opposite the Levites, the priests were blowing the trumpets, while all Israel stood there.
11332	14	7	7	Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that is in front of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. He offered burnt sacrifices, grain offerings, and the fat from the peace offerings there, because the bronze altar that Solomon had made was too small to hold all these offerings.
11333	14	7	8	At that time Solomon and all Israel with him celebrated a festival for seven days. This great assembly included people from Lebo Hamath in the north to the Stream of Egypt in the south.
11334	14	7	9	On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had dedicated the altar for seven days and celebrated the festival for seven more days.
11335	14	7	10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people home. They left happy and contented because of the good the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had done for David, Solomon, and his people Israel.
11336	14	7	11	¶After Solomon finished building the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and the royal palace, and accomplished all his plans for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and his royal palace,
11337	14	7	12	the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon at night and said to him: “I have answered your prayer and chosen this place to be my temple where sacrifices are to be made.
11338	14	7	13	When I close up the sky so that it doesn’t rain, or command locusts to devour the land’s vegetation, or send a plague among my people,
11339	14	7	14	if my people, who belong to me, humble themselves, pray, seek to please me, and repudiate their sinful practices, then I will respond from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.
11340	14	7	15	Now I will be attentive and responsive to the prayers offered in this place.
11341	14	7	16	Now I have chosen and consecrated this temple by making it my permanent home; I will be constantly present there.
11342	14	7	17	You must serve me as your father David did. Do everything I commanded and obey my rules and regulations.
11343	14	7	18	Then I will establish your dynasty, just as I promised your father David, ‘You will not fail to have a successor ruling over Israel.’
11344	14	7	19	¶“But if you people ever turn away from me, fail to obey the regulations and rules I instructed you to keep, and decide to serve and worship other gods,
11345	14	7	20	then I will remove you from my land I have given you, I will abandon this temple I have consecrated with my presence, and I will make you an object of mockery and ridicule among all the nations.
11346	14	7	21	As for this temple, which was once majestic, everyone who passes by it will be shocked and say, ‘Why did the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> do this to this land and this temple?’
11347	14	7	22	Others will then answer, ‘Because they abandoned the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors, who led them out of Egypt. They embraced other gods whom they worshiped and served. That is why he brought all this disaster down on them.’”
11348	14	8	1	¶After twenty years, during which Solomon built the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and his royal palace,
11349	14	8	2	Solomon rebuilt the cities that Huram had given him and settled Israelites there.
11350	14	8	3	Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it.
11351	14	8	4	He built up Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities he had built in Hamath.
11352	14	8	5	He made upper Beth Horon and lower Beth Horon fortified cities with walls and barred gates,
11353	14	8	6	and built up Baalath, all the storage cities that belonged to him, and all the cities where chariots and horses were kept. He built whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout his entire kingdom.
11354	14	8	7	¶Now several non-Israelite peoples were left in the land after the conquest of Joshua, including the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
11355	14	8	8	Their descendants remained in the land (the Israelites were unable to wipe them out). Solomon conscripted them for his work crews and they continue in that role to this very day.
11356	14	8	9	Solomon did not assign Israelites to these work crews; the Israelites served as his soldiers, officers, charioteers, and commanders of his chariot forces.
11357	14	8	10	These men worked for King Solomon as supervisors; there were a total of 250 of them who were in charge of the people.
11358	14	8	11	¶Solomon moved Pharaoh’s daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, for he said, “My wife must not live in the palace of King David of Israel, for the places where the ark of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has entered are holy.”
11359	14	8	12	¶Then Solomon offered burnt sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> which he had built in front of the temple’s porch.
11360	14	8	13	He observed the daily requirements for sacrifices that Moses had specified for Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and the three annual celebrations – the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Shelters.
11361	14	8	14	As his father David had decreed, Solomon appointed the divisions of the priests to do their assigned tasks, the Levitical orders to lead worship and help the priests with their daily tasks, and the divisions of the gatekeepers to serve at their assigned gates. This was what David the man of God had ordered.
11362	14	8	15	They did not neglect any detail of the king’s orders pertaining to the priests, Levites, and treasuries.
11363	14	8	16	¶All the work ordered by Solomon was completed, from the day the foundation of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple was laid until it was finished; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple was completed.
11364	14	8	17	¶Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and to Elat on the coast in the land of Edom.
11365	14	8	18	Huram sent him ships and some of his sailors, men who were well acquainted with the sea. They sailed with Solomon’s men to Ophir, and took from there 450 talents of gold, which they brought back to King Solomon.
11366	14	9	1	¶When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon, she came to challenge him with difficult questions. She arrived in Jerusalem with a great display of pomp, bringing with her camels carrying spices, a very large quantity of gold, and precious gems. She visited Solomon and discussed with him everything that was on her mind.
11367	14	9	2	Solomon answered all her questions; there was no question too complex for the king.
11368	14	9	3	When the queen of Sheba saw for herself Solomon’s wisdom, the palace he had built,
11369	14	9	4	the food in his banquet hall, his servants and attendants in their robes, his cupbearers in their robes, and his burnt sacrifices which he presented in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, she was amazed.
11370	14	9	5	She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your wise sayings and insight was true!
11371	14	9	6	I did not believe these things until I came and saw them with my own eyes. Indeed, I didn’t hear even half the story! Your wisdom surpasses what was reported to me.
11372	14	9	7	Your attendants, who stand before you at all times and hear your wise sayings, are truly happy!
11373	14	9	8	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God be praised because he favored you by placing you on his throne as the one ruling on his behalf! Because of your God’s love for Israel and his lasting commitment to them, he made you king over them so you could make just and right decisions.”
11374	14	9	9	She gave the king 120 talents of gold and a very large quantity of spices and precious gems. The quantity of spices the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon has never been matched.
11375	14	9	10	(Huram’s servants, aided by Solomon’s servants, brought gold from Ophir, as well as fine timber and precious gems.
11376	14	9	11	With the timber the king made steps for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and royal palace as well as stringed instruments for the musicians. No one had seen anything like them in the land of Judah prior to that.)
11377	14	9	12	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she requested, more than what she had brought him. Then she left and returned to her homeland with her attendants.
11378	14	9	13	¶Solomon received 666 talents of gold per year,
11379	14	9	14	besides what he collected from the merchants and traders. All the Arabian kings and the governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
11380	14	9	15	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; 600 measures of hammered gold were used for each shield.
11381	14	9	16	He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; 300 measures of gold were used for each of those shields. The king placed them in the Palace of the Lebanon Forest.
11382	14	9	17	¶The king made a large throne decorated with ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
11383	14	9	18	There were six steps leading up to the throne, and a gold footstool was attached to the throne. The throne had two armrests with a statue of a lion standing on each side.
11384	14	9	19	There were twelve statues of lions on the six steps, one lion at each end of each step. There was nothing like it in any other kingdom.
11385	14	9	20	¶All of King Solomon’s cups were made of gold, and all the household items in the Palace of the Lebanon Forest were made of pure gold. There were no silver items, for silver was not considered very valuable in Solomon’s time.
11386	14	9	21	The king had a fleet of large merchant ships manned by Huram’s men that sailed the sea. Once every three years the fleet came into port with cargoes of gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
11387	14	9	22	¶King Solomon was wealthier and wiser than any of the kings of the earth.
11388	14	9	23	All the kings of the earth wanted to visit Solomon to see him display his God-given wisdom.
11389	14	9	24	Year after year visitors brought their gifts, which included items of silver, items of gold, clothes, perfume, spices, horses, and mules.
11390	14	9	25	¶Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his chariot horses and 12,000 horses. He kept them in assigned cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
11391	14	9	26	He ruled all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines as far as the border of Egypt.
11392	14	9	27	The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones; cedar was as plentiful as sycamore fig trees are in the foothills.
11393	14	9	28	Solomon acquired horses from Egypt and from all the lands.
11394	14	9	29	¶The rest of the events of Solomon’s reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Annals of Nathan the Prophet, the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and the Vision of Iddo the Seer pertaining to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
11395	14	9	30	Solomon ruled over all Israel from Jerusalem for forty years.
11396	14	9	31	Then Solomon passed away and was buried in the city of his father David. His son Rehoboam replaced him as king.
11397	14	10	1	¶Rehoboam traveled to Shechem, for all Israel had gathered in Shechem to make Rehoboam king.
11398	14	10	2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard the news, he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon. Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
11399	14	10	3	They sent for him and Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
11400	14	10	4	“Your father made us work too hard! Now if you lighten the demands he made and don’t make us work as hard, we will serve you.”
11401	14	10	5	He said to them, “Go away for three days, then return to me.” So the people went away.
11402	14	10	6	¶King Rehoboam consulted with the older advisers who had served his father Solomon when he had been alive. He asked them, “How do you advise me to answer these people?”
11403	14	10	7	They said to him, “If you are fair to these people, grant their request, and are cordial to them, they will be your servants from this time forward.”
11404	14	10	8	But Rehoboam rejected their advice and consulted the young advisers who served him, with whom he had grown up.
11405	14	10	9	He asked them, “How do you advise me to respond to these people who said to me, ‘Lessen the demands your father placed on us’?”
11406	14	10	10	The young advisers with whom Rehoboam had grown up said to him, “Say this to these people who have said to you, ‘Your father made us work hard, but now lighten our burden’ – say this to them: ‘I am a lot harsher than my father!
11407	14	10	11	My father imposed heavy demands on you; I will make them even heavier. My father punished you with ordinary whips; I will punish you with whips that really sting your flesh.’”
11408	14	10	12	¶Jeroboam and all the people reported to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had ordered when he said, “Return to me on the third day.”
11409	14	10	13	The king responded to the people harshly. He rejected the advice of the older men
11410	14	10	14	and followed the advice of the younger ones. He said, “My father imposed heavy demands on you; I will make them even heavier. My father punished you with ordinary whips; I will punish you with whips that really sting your flesh.”
11411	14	10	15	The king refused to listen to the people, because God was instigating this turn of events so that he might bring to pass the prophetic announcement he had made through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
11412	14	10	16	¶When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king, “We have no portion in David – no share in the son of Jesse! Return to your homes, O Israel! Now, look after your own dynasty, O David!” So all Israel returned to their homes.
11413	14	10	17	(Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.)
11414	14	10	18	King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, the supervisor of the work crews, out after them, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to jump into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
11415	14	10	19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the Davidic dynasty to this very day.
11416	14	11	1	¶When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he summoned 180,000 skilled warriors from Judah and Benjamin to attack Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
11417	14	11	2	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to the prophet Shemaiah,
11418	14	11	3	“Say this to King Rehoboam son of Solomon of Judah and to all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin,
11419	14	11	4	‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says this: “Do not attack and make war with your brothers. Each of you go home, for I have caused this to happen.”’” They obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and called off the attack against Jeroboam.
11420	14	11	5	¶Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem; he built up these fortified cities throughout Judah:
11421	14	11	6	Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
11422	14	11	7	Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam,
11423	14	11	8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
11424	14	11	9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
11425	14	11	10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These were the fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
11426	14	11	11	He fortified these cities and placed officers in them, as well as storehouses of food, olive oil, and wine.
11427	14	11	12	In each city there were shields and spears; he strongly fortified them. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.
11428	14	11	13	¶The priests and Levites who lived throughout Israel supported him, no matter where they resided.
11429	14	11	14	The Levites even left their pasturelands and their property behind and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons prohibited them from serving as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s priests.
11430	14	11	15	Jeroboam appointed his own priests to serve at the worship centers and to lead in the worship of the goat idols and calf idols he had made.
11431	14	11	16	Those among all the Israelite tribes who were determined to worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel followed them to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors.
11432	14	11	17	They supported the kingdom of Judah and were loyal to Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years; they followed the edicts of David and Solomon for three years.
11433	14	11	18	¶Rehoboam married Mahalath the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab.
11434	14	11	19	She bore him sons named Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
11435	14	11	20	He later married Maacah the daughter of Absalom. She bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
11436	14	11	21	Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than his other wives and concubines. He had eighteen wives and sixty concubines; he fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
11437	14	11	22	¶Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as the leader over his brothers, for he intended to name him his successor.
11438	14	11	23	He wisely placed some of his many sons throughout the regions of Judah and Benjamin in the various fortified cities. He supplied them with abundant provisions and acquired many wives for them.
11439	14	12	1	¶After Rehoboam’s rule was established and solidified, he and all Israel rejected the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11440	14	12	2	Because they were unfaithful to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> in King Rehoboam’s fifth year, King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem.
11441	14	12	3	He had 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen, and an innumerable number of soldiers who accompanied him from Egypt, including Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites.
11442	14	12	4	He captured the fortified cities of Judah and marched against Jerusalem.
11443	14	12	5	¶Shemaiah the prophet visited Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who were assembled in Jerusalem because of Shishak. He said to them, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‘You have rejected me, so I have rejected you and will hand you over to Shishak.’”
11444	14	12	6	The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is just.”
11445	14	12	7	When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> saw that they humbled themselves, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message came to Shemaiah: “They have humbled themselves, so I will not destroy them. I will deliver them soon. My anger will not be unleashed against Jerusalem through Shishak.
11446	14	12	8	Yet they will become his subjects, so they can experience how serving me differs from serving the surrounding nations.”
11447	14	12	9	¶King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and of the royal palace; he took everything, including the gold shields that Solomon had made.
11448	14	12	10	King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned them to the officers of the royal guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace.
11449	14	12	11	Whenever the king visited the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, the royal guards carried them and then brought them back to the guardroom.
11450	14	12	12	¶So when Rehoboam humbled himself, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> relented from his anger and did not annihilate him; Judah experienced some good things.
11451	14	12	13	King Rehoboam solidified his rule in Jerusalem; he was forty-one years old when he became king and he ruled for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> chose from all the tribes of Israel to be his home. Rehoboam’s mother was an Ammonite named Naamah.
11452	14	12	14	He did evil because he was not determined to follow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11453	14	12	15	¶The events of Rehoboam’s reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Annals of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the Seer that include genealogical records. There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
11454	14	12	16	Then Rehoboam passed away and was buried in the City of David. His son Abijah replaced him as king.
11455	14	13	1	¶In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah.
11456	14	13	2	He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. ¶There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
11457	14	13	3	Abijah launched the attack with 400,000 well-trained warriors, while Jeroboam deployed against him 800,000 well-trained warriors.
11458	14	13	4	¶Abijah ascended Mount Zemaraim, in the Ephraimite hill country, and said: “Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel!
11459	14	13	5	Don’t you realize that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has given David and his dynasty lasting dominion over Israel by a formal covenant?
11460	14	13	6	Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master.
11461	14	13	7	Lawless good-for-nothing men gathered around him and conspired against Rehoboam son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was an inexperienced young man and could not resist them.
11462	14	13	8	Now you are declaring that you will resist the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s rule through the Davidic dynasty. You have a huge army, and bring with you the gold calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods.
11463	14	13	9	But you banished the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s priests, Aaron’s descendants, and the Levites, and appointed your own priests just as the surrounding nations do! Anyone who comes to consecrate himself with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of these fake gods!
11464	14	13	10	But as for us, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is our God and we have not rejected him. Aaron’s descendants serve as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s priests and the Levites assist them with the work.
11465	14	13	11	They offer burnt sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> every morning and every evening, along with fragrant incense. They arrange the Bread of the Presence on a ritually clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. Certainly we are observing the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God’s regulations, but you have rejected him.
11466	14	13	12	Now look, God is with us as our leader. His priests are ready to blow the trumpets to signal the attack against you. You Israelites, don’t fight against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of your ancestors, for you will not win!”
11467	14	13	13	¶Now Jeroboam had sent some men to ambush the Judahite army from behind. The main army was in front of the Judahite army; the ambushers were behind it.
11468	14	13	14	The men of Judah turned around and realized they were being attacked from the front and the rear. So they cried out for help to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The priests blew their trumpets,
11469	14	13	15	and the men of Judah gave the battle cry. As the men of Judah gave the battle cry, God struck down Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
11470	14	13	16	The Israelites fled from before the Judahite army, and God handed them over to the men of Judah.
11471	14	13	17	Abijah and his army thoroughly defeated them; 500,000 well-trained Israelite men fell dead.
11472	14	13	18	That day the Israelites were defeated; the men of Judah prevailed because they relied on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors.
11473	14	13	19	¶Abijah chased Jeroboam; he seized from him these cities: Bethel and its surrounding towns, Jeshanah and its surrounding towns, and Ephron and its surrounding towns.
11474	14	13	20	Jeroboam did not regain power during the reign of Abijah. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> struck him down and he died.
11475	14	13	21	Abijah’s power grew; he had fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
11476	14	13	22	¶The rest of the events of Abijah’s reign, including his deeds and sayings, are recorded in the writings of the prophet Iddo.
11477	14	14	1	¶(13:23) Abijah passed away and was buried in the City of David. His son Asa replaced him as king. During his reign the land had rest for ten years.
11478	14	14	2	¶(14:1) Asa did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God desired and approved.
11479	14	14	3	He removed the pagan altars and the high places, smashed the sacred pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles.
11480	14	14	4	He ordered Judah to seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors and to observe his law and commands.
11481	14	14	5	He removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah. The kingdom had rest under his rule.
11482	14	14	6	¶He built fortified cities throughout Judah, for the land was at rest and there was no war during those years; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave him peace.
11483	14	14	7	He said to the people of Judah: “Let’s build these cities and fortify them with walls, towers, and barred gates. The land remains ours because we have followed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God; we have followed him, and he has made us secure on all sides.” So they built the cities and prospered.
11484	14	14	8	¶Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, equipped with large shields and spears. He also had 280,000 men from Benjamin who carried small shields and were adept archers; they were all skilled warriors.
11485	14	14	9	Zerah the Cushite marched against them with an army of 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots . He arrived at Mareshah,
11486	14	14	10	and Asa went out to oppose him. They deployed for battle in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
11487	14	14	11	¶Asa prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God: “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, there is no one but you who can help the weak when they are vastly outnumbered. Help us, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, for we rely on you and have marched on your behalf against this huge army. O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> you are our God; don’t let men prevail against you!”
11488	14	14	12	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled,
11489	14	14	13	and Asa and his army chased them as far as Gerar. The Cushites were wiped out; they were shattered before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and his army. The men of Judah carried off a huge amount of plunder.
11490	14	14	14	They defeated all the cities surrounding Gerar, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> caused them to panic. The men of Judah looted all the cities, for they contained a huge amount of goods.
11491	14	14	15	They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen in charge of the livestock. They carried off many sheep and camels and then returned to Jerusalem.
11492	14	15	1	¶God’s Spirit came upon Azariah son of Oded.
11493	14	15	2	He met Asa and told him, “Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with you when you are loyal to him. If you seek him, he will respond to you, but if you reject him, he will reject you.
11494	14	15	3	For a long time Israel had no true God, or priest to instruct them, or law.
11495	14	15	4	Because of their distress, they turned back to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel. They sought him and he responded to them.
11496	14	15	5	In those days no one could travel safely, for total chaos had overtaken all the people of the surrounding lands.
11497	14	15	6	One nation was crushed by another, and one city by another, for God caused them to be in great turmoil.
11498	14	15	7	But as for you, be strong and don’t get discouraged, for your work will be rewarded.”
11499	14	15	8	¶When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he was encouraged. He removed the detestable idols from the entire land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities he had seized in the Ephraimite hill country. He repaired the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in front of the porch of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11500	14	15	9	¶He assembled all Judah and Benjamin, as well as the settlers from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had come to live with them. Many people from Israel had come there to live when they saw that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God was with him.
11501	14	15	10	They assembled in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign.
11502	14	15	11	At that time they sacrificed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> some of the plunder they had brought back, including 700 head of cattle and 7,000 sheep.
11503	14	15	12	They solemnly agreed to seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors with their whole heart and being.
11504	14	15	13	Anyone who would not seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel would be executed, whether they were young or old, male or female.
11505	14	15	14	They swore their allegiance to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, shouting their approval loudly and sounding trumpets and horns.
11506	14	15	15	All Judah was happy about the oath, because they made the vow with their whole heart. They willingly sought the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and he responded to them. He made them secure on every side.
11507	14	15	16	¶King Asa also removed Maacah his grandmother from her position as queen mother because she had made a loathsome Asherah pole. Asa cut down her loathsome pole and crushed and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
11508	14	15	17	The high places were not eliminated from Israel, yet Asa was wholeheartedly devoted to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> throughout his lifetime.
11509	14	15	18	He brought the holy items that his father and he had made into God’s temple, including the silver, gold, and other articles.
11510	14	15	19	¶There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
11511	14	16	1	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, King Baasha of Israel attacked Judah, and he established Ramah as a military outpost to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the land of King Asa of Judah.
11512	14	16	2	Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and of the royal palace and sent it to King Ben Hadad of Syria, ruler in Damascus, along with this message:
11513	14	16	3	“I want to make a treaty with you, like the one our fathers made. See, I have sent you silver and gold. Break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel, so he will retreat from my land.”
11514	14	16	4	Ben Hadad accepted King Asa’s offer and ordered his army commanders to attack the cities of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.
11515	14	16	5	When Baasha heard the news, he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned the project.
11516	14	16	6	King Asa ordered all the men of Judah to carry away the stones and wood that Baasha had used to build Ramah. He used the materials to build up Geba and Mizpah.
11517	14	16	7	¶At that time Hanani the prophet visited King Asa of Judah and said to him: “Because you relied on the king of Syria and did not rely on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand.
11518	14	16	8	Did not the Cushites and Libyans have a huge army with chariots and a very large number of horsemen? But when you relied on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he handed them over to you!
11519	14	16	9	Certainly the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> watches the whole earth carefully and is ready to strengthen those who are devoted to him. You have acted foolishly in this matter; from now on you will have war.”
11520	14	16	10	Asa was so angry at the prophet, he put him in jail. Asa also oppressed some of the people at that time.
11521	14	16	11	¶The events of Asa’s reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
11522	14	16	12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a foot disease and his disease became severe. Yet even in his disease, he did not seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, but only the doctors.
11523	14	16	13	Asa passed away in the forty-first year of his reign.
11524	14	16	14	He was buried in the tomb he had carved out in the City of David. They laid him to rest on a platform covered with spices and assorted mixtures of ointments. They made a huge bonfire to honor him.
11525	14	17	1	¶His son Jehoshaphat replaced him as king and solidified his rule over Israel.
11526	14	17	2	He placed troops in all of Judah’s fortified cities and posted garrisons throughout the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had seized.
11527	14	17	3	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was with Jehoshaphat because he followed in his ancestor David’s footsteps at the beginning of his reign. He did not seek the Baals,
11528	14	17	4	but instead sought the God of his ancestors and obeyed his commands, unlike the Israelites.
11529	14	17	5	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made his kingdom secure; all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he became very wealthy and greatly respected.
11530	14	17	6	He was committed to following the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; he even removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.
11531	14	17	7	¶In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah.
11532	14	17	8	They were accompanied by the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah, and by the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
11533	14	17	9	They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the scroll of the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They traveled to all the cities of Judah and taught the people.
11534	14	17	10	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> put fear into all the kingdoms surrounding Judah; they did not make war with Jehoshaphat.
11535	14	17	11	Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat tribute, including a load of silver. The Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks.
11536	14	17	12	¶Jehoshaphat’s power kept increasing. He built fortresses and storage cities throughout Judah.
11537	14	17	13	He had many supplies stored in the cities of Judah and an army of skilled warriors stationed in Jerusalem.
11538	14	17	14	These were their divisions by families: ¶There were a thousand officers from Judah. Adnah the commander led 300,000 skilled warriors,
11539	14	17	15	Jehochanan the commander led 280,000.
11540	14	17	16	and Amasiah son of Zikri, who volunteered to serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, led 200,000 skilled warriors.
11541	14	17	17	¶From Benjamin, Eliada, a skilled warrior, led 200,000 men who were equipped with bows and shields,
11542	14	17	18	and Jehozabad led 180,000 trained warriors.
11543	14	17	19	¶These were the ones who served the king, besides those whom the king placed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
11544	14	18	1	¶Jehoshaphat was very wealthy and greatly respected. He made an alliance by marriage with Ahab,
11545	14	18	2	and after several years went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle to honor Jehoshaphat and those who came with him. He persuaded him to join in an attack against Ramoth Gilead.
11546	14	18	3	King Ahab of Israel said to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, “Will you go with me to attack Ramoth Gilead?” He replied, “I will support you; my army is at your disposal and will support you in battle.”
11547	14	18	4	Then Jehoshaphat said further to the king of Israel, “First, please seek an oracle from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
11548	14	18	5	So the king of Israel assembled 400 prophets and asked them, “Should we attack Ramoth Gilead or not?” They said, “Attack! God will hand it over to the king.”
11549	14	18	6	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not a prophet of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> still here, that we may ask him?”
11550	14	18	7	The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man through whom we can seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s will– But I despise him because he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but always disaster–Micaiah son of Imlah.” Jehoshaphat said, “The king should not say such things!”
11551	14	18	8	The king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah.”
11552	14	18	9	¶Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their respective thrones, dressed in their royal robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. All the prophets were prophesying before them.
11553	14	18	10	Zedekiah son of Kenaanah made iron horns and said, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘With these you will gore Syria until they are destroyed!’”
11554	14	18	11	All the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Attack Ramoth Gilead! You will succeed; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will hand it over to the king!”
11555	14	18	12	Now the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the prophets are in complete agreement that the king will succeed. Your words must agree with theirs; you must predict success!”
11556	14	18	13	But Micaiah said, “As certainly as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, I will say what my God tells me to say!”
11557	14	18	14	¶Micaiah came before the king and the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth Gilead or not?” He answered him, “Attack! You will succeed; they will be handed over to you.”
11558	14	18	15	The king said to him, “How many times must I make you solemnly promise in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to tell me only the truth?”
11559	14	18	16	Micaiah replied, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep that have no shepherd. Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‘They have no master. They should go home in peace.’”
11560	14	18	17	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster?”
11561	14	18	18	Micaiah said, “That being the case, listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message. I saw the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sitting on his throne, with all the heavenly assembly standing on his right and on his left.
11562	14	18	19	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‘Who will deceive King Ahab of Israel, so he will attack Ramoth Gilead and die there?’ One said this and another that.
11563	14	18	20	Then a spirit stepped forward and stood before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He said, ‘I will deceive him.’ The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> asked him, ‘How?’
11564	14	18	21	He replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‘Deceive and overpower him. Go out and do as you have proposed.’
11565	14	18	22	So now, look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has placed a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has decreed disaster for you.”
11566	14	18	23	Zedekiah son of Kenaanah approached, hit Micaiah on the jaw, and said, “Which way did the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s spirit go when he went from me to speak to you?”
11567	14	18	24	Micaiah replied, “Look, you will see in the day when you go into an inner room to hide.”
11568	14	18	25	Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the city official and Joash the king’s son.
11569	14	18	26	Say, ‘This is what the king says: “Put this man in prison. Give him only a little bread and water until I return safely.”’”
11570	14	18	27	Micaiah said, “If you really do return safely, then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not spoken through me!” Then he added, “Take note, all you people.”
11571	14	18	28	¶The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah attacked Ramoth Gilead.
11572	14	18	29	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and then enter the battle, but you wear your royal attire.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and they entered the battle.
11573	14	18	30	Now the king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders, “Do not fight common soldiers or high ranking officers; fight only the king of Israel!”
11574	14	18	31	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “He must be the king of Israel!” So they turned and attacked him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> helped him; God lured them away from him.
11575	14	18	32	When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him.
11576	14	18	33	Now an archer shot an arrow at random and it struck the king of Israel between the plates of his armor. The king ordered his charioteer, “Turn around and take me from the battle line, for I am wounded.”
11577	14	18	34	While the battle raged throughout the day, the king of Israel stood propped up in his chariot opposite the Syrians. He died in the evening as the sun was setting.
11578	14	19	1	¶When King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned home safely to Jerusalem,
11579	14	19	2	the prophet Jehu son of Hanani confronted him; he said to King Jehoshaphat, “Is it right to help the wicked and be an ally of those who oppose the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>? Because you have done this the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is angry with you!
11580	14	19	3	Nevertheless you have done some good things; you removed the Asherah poles from the land and you were determined to follow God.”
11581	14	19	4	¶Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem. He went out among the people from Beer Sheba to the hill country of Ephraim and encouraged them to follow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors.
11582	14	19	5	He appointed judges throughout the land and in each of the fortified cities of Judah.
11583	14	19	6	He told the judges, “Be careful what you do, for you are not judging for men, but for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who will be with you when you make judicial decisions.
11584	14	19	7	Respect the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and make careful decisions, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God disapproves of injustice, partiality, and bribery.”
11585	14	19	8	¶In Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed some Levites, priests, and Israelite family leaders to judge on behalf of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and to settle disputes among the residents of Jerusalem.
11586	14	19	9	He commanded them: “Carry out your duties with respect for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, with honesty, and with pure motives.
11587	14	19	10	Whenever your countrymen who live in the cities bring a case before you (whether it involves a violent crime or other matters related to the law, commandments, rules, and regulations), warn them that they must not sin against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. If you fail to do so, God will be angry with you and your colleagues, but if you obey, you will be free of guilt.
11588	14	19	11	Take note, Amariah the chief priest will oversee you in every matter pertaining to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the family of Judah, in every matter pertaining to the king. The Levites will serve as officials before you. Act courageously! And may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> be with those who do well!”
11589	14	20	1	¶Later the Moabites and Ammonites, along with some of the Meunites, attacked Jehoshaphat.
11590	14	20	2	Messengers arrived and reported to Jehoshaphat, “A huge army is attacking you from the other side of the Dead Sea, from the direction of Edom. Look, they are in Hazezon Tamar (that is, En Gedi).”
11591	14	20	3	Jehoshaphat was afraid, so he decided to seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s advice. He decreed that all Judah should observe a fast.
11592	14	20	4	The people of Judah assembled to ask for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s help; they came from all the cities of Judah to ask for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s help.
11593	14	20	5	¶Jehoshaphat stood before the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, in front of the new courtyard.
11594	14	20	6	He prayed: “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of our ancestors, you are the God who lives in heaven and rules over all the kingdoms of the nations. You possess strength and power; no one can stand against you.
11595	14	20	7	Our God, you drove out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and gave it as a permanent possession to the descendants of your friend Abraham.
11596	14	20	8	They settled down in it and built in it a temple to honor you, saying,
11597	14	20	9	‘If disaster comes on us in the form of military attack, judgment, plague, or famine, we will stand in front of this temple before you, for you are present in this temple. We will cry out to you for help in our distress, so that you will hear and deliver us.’
11598	14	20	10	Now the Ammonites, Moabites, and men from Mount Seir are coming! When Israel came from the land of Egypt, you did not allow them to invade these lands. They bypassed them and did not destroy them.
11599	14	20	11	Look how they are repaying us! They come to drive us out of our allotted land which you assigned to us!
11600	14	20	12	Our God, will you not judge them? For we are powerless against this huge army that attacks us! We don’t know what we should do; we look to you for help.”
11601	14	20	13	¶All the men of Judah were standing before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, along with their infants, wives, and children.
11602	14	20	14	Then in the midst of the assembly, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit came upon Jachaziel son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph.
11603	14	20	15	He said: “Pay attention, all you people of Judah, residents of Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat! This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to you: ‘Don’t be afraid and don’t panic because of this huge army! For the battle is not yours, but God’s.
11604	14	20	16	Tomorrow march down against them as they come up the Ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the ravine in front of the wilderness of Jeruel.
11605	14	20	17	You will not fight in this battle. Take your positions, stand, and watch the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> deliver you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Don’t be afraid and don’t panic! Tomorrow march out toward them; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with you!’”
11606	14	20	18	¶Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face toward the ground, and all the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem fell down before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and worshiped him.
11607	14	20	19	Then some Levites, from the Kohathites and Korahites, got up and loudly praised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
11608	14	20	20	¶Early the next morning they marched out to the wilderness of Tekoa. When they were ready to march, Jehoshaphat stood up and said: “Listen to me, you people of Judah and residents of Jerusalem! Trust in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and you will be safe! Trust in the message of his prophets and you will win.”
11609	14	20	21	He met with the people and appointed musicians to play before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and praise his majestic splendor. As they marched ahead of the warriors they said: “Give thanks to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for his loyal love endures.”
11610	14	20	22	¶When they began to shout and praise, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> suddenly attacked the Ammonites, Moabites, and men from Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated.
11611	14	20	23	The Ammonites and Moabites attacked the men from Mount Seir and annihilated them. When they had finished off the men of Seir, they attacked and destroyed one another.
11612	14	20	24	When the men of Judah arrived at the observation post overlooking the wilderness and looked at the huge army, they saw dead bodies on the ground; there were no survivors!
11613	14	20	25	Jehoshaphat and his men went to gather the plunder; they found a huge amount of supplies, clothing, and valuable items. They carried away everything they could. There was so much plunder, it took them three days to haul it off.
11614	14	20	26	¶On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, where they praised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. So that place is called the Valley of Berachah to this very day.
11615	14	20	27	Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat leading them; the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had given them reason to rejoice over their enemies.
11616	14	20	28	They entered Jerusalem to the sound of stringed instruments and trumpets and proceeded to the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11617	14	20	29	All the kingdoms of the surrounding lands were afraid of God when they heard how the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had fought against Israel’s enemies.
11618	14	20	30	Jehoshaphat’s kingdom enjoyed peace; his God made him secure on every side.
11619	14	20	31	¶Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
11620	14	20	32	He followed in his father Asa’s footsteps and was careful to do what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved.
11621	14	20	33	However, the high places were not eliminated; the people were still not devoted to the God of their ancestors.
11622	14	20	34	¶The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are included in the Scroll of the Kings of Israel.
11623	14	20	35	¶Later King Jehoshaphat of Judah made an alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, who did evil.
11624	14	20	36	They agreed to make large seagoing merchant ships; they built the ships in Ezion Geber.
11625	14	20	37	Eliezer son of Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, “Because you made an alliance with Ahaziah, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will shatter what you have made.” The ships were wrecked and unable to go to sea.
11626	14	21	1	¶Jehoshaphat passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Jehoram replaced him as king.
11627	14	21	2	¶His brothers, Jehoshaphat’s sons, were Azariah, Jechiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. All of these were sons of King Jehoshaphat of Israel.
11628	14	21	3	Their father gave them many presents, including silver, gold, and other precious items, along with fortified cities in Judah. But he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn.
11629	14	21	4	¶Jehoram took control of his father’s kingdom and became powerful. Then he killed all his brothers, as well as some of the officials of Israel.
11630	14	21	5	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
11631	14	21	6	He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel, just as Ahab’s dynasty had done, for he married Ahab’s daughter. He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11632	14	21	7	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was unwilling to destroy David’s dynasty because of the promise he had made to give David a perpetual dynasty.
11633	14	21	8	¶During Jehoram’s reign Edom freed themselves from Judah’s control and set up their own king.
11634	14	21	9	Jehoram crossed over with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites, who had surrounded him, attacked at night and defeated him and his chariot officers.
11635	14	21	10	So Edom has remained free from Judah’s control to this very day. At that same time Libnah also rebelled and freed themselves from Judah’s control because Jehoram rejected the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of his ancestors.
11636	14	21	11	He also built high places on the hills of Judah; he encouraged the residents of Jerusalem to be unfaithful to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and led Judah away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11637	14	21	12	¶Jehoram received this letter from Elijah the prophet: “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of your ancestor David says: ‘You have not followed in the footsteps of your father Jehoshaphat and of King Asa of Judah,
11638	14	21	13	but have instead followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel. You encouraged the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem to be unfaithful to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, just as the family of Ahab does in Israel. You also killed your brothers, members of your father’s family, who were better than you.
11639	14	21	14	So look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is about to severely afflict your people, your sons, your wives, and all you own.
11640	14	21	15	And you will get a serious, chronic intestinal disease which will cause your intestines to come out.”
11641	14	21	16	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> stirred up against Jehoram the Philistines and the Arabs who lived beside the Cushites.
11642	14	21	17	They attacked Judah and swept through it. They carried off everything they found in the royal palace, including his sons and wives. None of his sons was left, except for his youngest, Ahaziah.
11643	14	21	18	After all this happened, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> afflicted him with an incurable intestinal disease.
11644	14	21	19	After about two years his intestines came out because of the disease, so that he died a very painful death. His people did not make a bonfire to honor him, as they had done for his ancestors.
11645	14	21	20	¶Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. No one regretted his death; he was buried in the City of David, but not in the royal tombs.
11646	14	22	1	¶The residents of Jerusalem made his youngest son Ahaziah king in his place, for the raiding party that invaded the camp with the Arabs had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah.
11647	14	22	2	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri.
11648	14	22	3	He followed in the footsteps of Ahab’s dynasty, for his mother gave him evil advice.
11649	14	22	4	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> like Ahab’s dynasty because, after his father’s death, they gave him advice that led to his destruction.
11650	14	22	5	He followed their advice and joined Ahab’s son King Joram of Israel in a battle against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth Gilead in which the Syrians defeated Joram.
11651	14	22	6	Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians in Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Syria. Ahaziah son of King Jehoram of Judah went down to visit Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he had been wounded.
11652	14	22	7	¶God brought about Ahaziah’s downfall through his visit to Joram. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commissioned to wipe out Ahab’s family.
11653	14	22	8	While Jehu was dishing out punishment to Ahab’s family, he discovered the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s relatives who were serving Ahaziah and killed them.
11654	14	22	9	He looked for Ahaziah, who was captured while hiding in Samaria. They brought him to Jehu and then executed him. They did give him a burial, for they reasoned, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with his whole heart.” There was no one in Ahaziah’s family strong enough to rule in his place.
11655	14	22	10	¶When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she was determined to destroy the entire royal line of Judah.
11656	14	22	11	So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Ahaziah’s son Joash and stole him away from the rest of the royal descendants who were to be executed. She hid him and his nurse in the room where the bed covers were stored. So Jehoshabeath the daughter of King Jehoram, wife of Jehoiada the priest and sister of Ahaziah, hid him from Athaliah so she could not execute him.
11657	14	22	12	He remained in hiding in God’s temple for six years, while Athaliah was ruling over the land.
11658	14	23	1	¶In the seventh year Jehoiada made a bold move. He made a pact with the officers of the units of hundreds: Azariah son of Jehoram, Ishmael son of Jehochanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zikri.
11659	14	23	2	They traveled throughout Judah and assembled the Levites from all the cities of Judah, as well as the Israelite family leaders.¶They came to Jerusalem,
11660	14	23	3	and the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in the temple of God. Jehoiada said to them, “The king’s son will rule, just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> promised David’s descendants.
11661	14	23	4	This is what you must do. One third of you priests and Levites who are on duty during the Sabbath will guard the doors.
11662	14	23	5	Another third of you will be stationed at the royal palace and still another third at the Foundation Gate. All the others will stand in the courtyards of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11663	14	23	6	No one must enter the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple except the priests and Levites who are on duty. They may enter because they are ceremonially pure. All the others should carry out their assigned service to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11664	14	23	7	The Levites must surround the king. Each of you must hold his weapon in his hand. Whoever tries to enter the temple must be killed. You must accompany the king wherever he goes.”
11665	14	23	8	¶The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each of them took his men, those who were on duty during the Sabbath as well as those who were off duty on the Sabbath. Jehoiada the priest did not release his divisions from their duties.
11666	14	23	9	Jehoiada the priest gave to the officers of the units of hundreds King David’s spears and shields that were kept in God’s temple.
11667	14	23	10	He placed the men at their posts, each holding his weapon in his hand. They lined up from the south side of the temple to the north side and stood near the altar and the temple, surrounding the king.
11668	14	23	11	Jehoiada and his sons led out the king’s son and placed on him the crown and the royal insignia. They proclaimed him king and poured olive oil on his head. They declared, “Long live the king!”
11669	14	23	12	¶When Athaliah heard the royal guard shouting and praising the king, she joined the crowd at the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11670	14	23	13	Then she saw the king standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and trumpeters stood beside the king and all the people of the land were celebrating and blowing trumpets, and the musicians with various instruments were leading the celebration. Athaliah tore her clothes and yelled, “Treason! Treason!”
11671	14	23	14	Jehoiada the priest sent out the officers of the units of hundreds, who were in charge of the army, and ordered them, “Bring her outside the temple to the guards. Put the sword to anyone who follows her.” The priest gave this order because he had decided she should not be executed in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11672	14	23	15	They seized her and took her into the precincts of the royal palace through the horses’ entrance. There they executed her.
11673	14	23	16	¶Jehoiada then drew up a covenant stipulating that he, all the people, and the king should be loyal to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11674	14	23	17	All the people went and demolished the temple of Baal. They smashed its altars and idols. They killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
11675	14	23	18	Jehoiada then assigned the duties of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple to the priests, the Levites whom David had assigned to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. They were responsible for offering burnt sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with joy and music, according to the law of Moses and the edict of David.
11676	14	23	19	He posted guards at the gates of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, so no one who was ceremonially unclean in any way could enter.
11677	14	23	20	He summoned the officers of the units of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and he then led the king down from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. They entered the royal palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne.
11678	14	23	21	All the people of the land celebrated, for the city had rest now that they had killed Athaliah.
11679	14	24	1	¶Joash was seven years old when he began to reign. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah, who was from Beer Sheba.
11680	14	24	2	Joash did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved throughout the lifetime of Jehoiada the priest.
11681	14	24	3	Jehoiada chose two wives for him who gave him sons and daughters.
11682	14	24	4	¶Later, Joash was determined to repair the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11683	14	24	5	He assembled the priests and Levites and ordered them, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect the annual quota of silver from all Israel for repairs on the temple of your God. Be quick about it!” But the Levites delayed.
11684	14	24	6	¶So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest, and said to him, “Why have you not made the Levites collect from Judah and Jerusalem the tax authorized by Moses the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s servant and by the assembly of Israel at the tent containing the tablets of the law?”
11685	14	24	7	(Wicked Athaliah and her sons had broken into God’s temple and used all the holy items of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple in their worship of the Baals.)
11686	14	24	8	The king ordered a chest to be made and placed outside the gate of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11687	14	24	9	An edict was sent throughout Judah and Jerusalem requiring the people to bring to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> the tax that Moses, God’s servant, imposed on Israel in the wilderness.
11688	14	24	10	All the officials and all the people gladly brought their silver and threw it into the chest until it was full.
11689	14	24	11	Whenever the Levites brought the chest to the royal accountant and they saw there was a lot of silver, the royal scribe and the accountant of the high priest emptied the chest and then took it back to its place. They went through this routine every day and collected a large amount of silver.
11690	14	24	12	¶The king and Jehoiada gave it to the construction foremen assigned to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. They hired carpenters and craftsmen to repair the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, as well as those skilled in working with iron and bronze to restore the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11691	14	24	13	They worked hard and made the repairs. They followed the measurements specified for God’s temple and restored it.
11692	14	24	14	When they were finished, they brought the rest of the silver to the king and Jehoiada. They used it to make items for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, including items used in the temple service and for burnt sacrifices, pans, and various other gold and silver items. Throughout Jehoiada’s lifetime, burnt sacrifices were offered regularly in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11693	14	24	15	¶Jehoiada grew old and died at the age of 130.
11694	14	24	16	He was buried in the City of David with the kings, because he had accomplished good in Israel and for God and his temple.
11695	14	24	17	¶After Jehoiada died, the officials of Judah visited the king and declared their loyalty to him. The king listened to their advice.
11696	14	24	18	They abandoned the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors, and worshiped the Asherah poles and idols. Because of this sinful activity, God was angry with Judah and Jerusalem.
11697	14	24	19	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent prophets among them to lead them back to him. They warned the people, but they would not pay attention.
11698	14	24	20	God’s Spirit energized Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood up before the people and said to them, “This is what God says: ‘Why are you violating the commands of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>? You will not be prosperous! Because you have rejected the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he has rejected you!’”
11699	14	24	21	They plotted against him and by royal decree stoned him to death in the courtyard of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11700	14	24	22	King Joash disregarded the loyalty his father Jehoiada had shown him and killed Jehoiada’s son. As Zechariah was dying, he said, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> take notice and seek vengeance!”
11701	14	24	23	¶At the beginning of the year the Syrian army attacked Joash and invaded Judah and Jerusalem. They wiped out all the leaders of the people and sent all the plunder they gathered to the king of Damascus.
11702	14	24	24	Even though the invading Syrian army was relatively weak, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> handed over to them Judah’s very large army, for the people of Judah had abandoned the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors. The Syrians gave Joash what he deserved.
11703	14	24	25	When they withdrew, they left Joash badly wounded. His servants plotted against him because of what he had done to the son of Jehoiada the priest. They murdered him on his bed. Thus he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
11704	14	24	26	The conspirators were Zabad son of Shimeath (an Ammonite woman) and Jehozabad son of Shimrith (a Moabite woman).
11705	14	24	27	¶The list of Joash’s sons, the many prophetic oracles about him, and the account of his building project on God’s temple are included in the record of the Scroll of the Kings. His son Amaziah replaced him as king.
11706	14	25	1	¶Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddan, who was from Jerusalem.
11707	14	25	2	He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved, but not with wholehearted devotion.
11708	14	25	3	¶When he had secured control of the kingdom, he executed the servants who had assassinated his father the king.
11709	14	25	4	However, he did not execute their sons. He obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commandment as recorded in the law scroll of Moses, “Fathers must not be executed for what their sons do, and sons must not be executed for what their fathers do. A man must be executed only for his own sin.”
11710	14	25	5	¶Amaziah assembled the people of Judah and assigned them by families to the commanders of units of a thousand and the commanders of units of a hundred for all Judah and Benjamin. He counted those twenty years old and up and discovered there were 300,000 young men of fighting age equipped with spears and shields.
11711	14	25	6	He hired 100,000 Israelite warriors for a hundred talents of silver.
11712	14	25	7	¶But a prophet visited him and said: “O king, the Israelite troops must not go with you, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is not with Israel or any of the Ephraimites.
11713	14	25	8	Even if you go and fight bravely in battle, God will defeat you before the enemy. God is capable of helping or defeating.”
11714	14	25	9	Amaziah asked the prophet: “But what should I do about the hundred talents of silver I paid the Israelite troops?” The prophet replied, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is capable of giving you more than that.”
11715	14	25	10	So Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were very angry at Judah and returned home incensed.
11716	14	25	11	Amaziah boldly led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he defeated 10,000 Edomites.
11717	14	25	12	The men of Judah captured 10,000 men alive. They took them to the top of a cliff and threw them over. All the captives fell to their death.
11718	14	25	13	Now the troops Amaziah had dismissed and had not allowed to fight in the battle raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed 3,000 people and carried off a large amount of plunder.
11719	14	25	14	¶When Amaziah returned from defeating the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir and made them his personal gods. He bowed down before them and offered them sacrifices.
11720	14	25	15	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was angry at Amaziah and sent a prophet to him, who said, “Why are you following these gods that could not deliver their own people from your power?”
11721	14	25	16	While he was speaking, Amaziah said to him, “Did we appoint you to be a royal counselor? Stop prophesying or else you will be killed!” So the prophet stopped, but added, “I know that God has decided to destroy you, because you have done this thing and refused to listen to my advice.”
11722	14	25	17	¶After King Amaziah of Judah consulted with his advisers, he sent this message to the king of Israel, Joash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, “Come, face me on the battlefield.”
11723	14	25	18	King Joash of Israel sent this message back to King Amaziah of Judah, “A thorn bush in Lebanon sent this message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son as a wife.’ Then a wild animal of Lebanon came by and trampled down the thorn bush.
11724	14	25	19	You defeated Edom and it has gone to your head. Gloat over your success, but stay in your palace. Why bring calamity on yourself? Why bring down yourself and Judah along with you?”
11725	14	25	20	¶But Amaziah did not heed the warning, for God wanted to hand them over to Joash because they followed the gods of Edom.
11726	14	25	21	So King Joash of Israel attacked. He and King Amaziah of Judah faced each other on the battlefield in Beth Shemesh of Judah.
11727	14	25	22	Judah was defeated by Israel, and each man ran back home.
11728	14	25	23	King Joash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, son of Joash son of Jehoahaz, in Beth Shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem. He broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate – a distance of about six hundred feet.
11729	14	25	24	He took away all the gold and silver, all the items found in God’s temple that were in the care of Obed-Edom, the riches in the royal palace, and some hostages. Then he went back to Samaria.
11730	14	25	25	¶King Amaziah son of Joash of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of King Joash son of Jehoahaz of Israel.
11731	14	25	26	The rest of the events of Amaziah’s reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
11732	14	25	27	From the time Amaziah turned from following the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, conspirators plotted against him in Jerusalem, so he fled to Lachish. But they sent assassins after him and they killed him there.
11733	14	25	28	His body was carried back by horses, and he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David.
11734	14	26	1	¶All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in his father Amaziah’s place.
11735	14	26	2	Uzziah built up Elat and restored it to Judah after King Amaziah had passed away.
11736	14	26	3	¶Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah, who was from Jerusalem.
11737	14	26	4	He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved, just as his father Amaziah had done.
11738	14	26	5	He followed God during the lifetime of Zechariah, who taught him how to honor God. As long as he followed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, God caused him to succeed.
11739	14	26	6	¶Uzziah attacked the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. He built cities in the region of Ashdod and throughout Philistine territory.
11740	14	26	7	God helped him in his campaigns against the Philistines, the Arabs living in Gur Baal, and the Meunites.
11741	14	26	8	The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah and his fame reached the border of Egypt, for he grew in power.
11742	14	26	9	¶Uzziah built and fortified towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, Valley Gate, and at the Angle.
11743	14	26	10	He built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns, for he owned many herds in the foothills and on the plain. He had workers in the fields and vineyards in the hills and in Carmel, for he loved agriculture.
11744	14	26	11	¶Uzziah had an army of skilled warriors trained for battle. They were organized by divisions according to the muster rolls made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer under the authority of Hananiah, a royal official.
11745	14	26	12	The total number of family leaders who led warriors was 2,600.
11746	14	26	13	They commanded an army of 307,500 skilled and able warriors who were ready to defend the king against his enemies.
11747	14	26	14	Uzziah supplied shields, spears, helmets, breastplates, bows, and slingstones for the entire army.
11748	14	26	15	In Jerusalem he made war machines carefully designed to shoot arrows and large stones from the towers and corners of the walls. He became very famous, for he received tremendous support and became powerful.
11749	14	26	16	¶But once he became powerful, his pride destroyed him. He disobeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God. He entered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple to offer incense on the incense altar.
11750	14	26	17	Azariah the priest and eighty other brave priests of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> followed him in.
11751	14	26	18	They confronted King Uzziah and said to him, “It is not proper for you, Uzziah, to offer incense to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. That is the responsibility of the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who are consecrated to offer incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have disobeyed and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God will not honor you!”
11752	14	26	19	Uzziah, who had an incense censer in his hand, became angry. While he was ranting and raving at the priests, a skin disease appeared on his forehead right there in front of the priests in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple near the incense altar.
11753	14	26	20	When Azariah the high priest and the other priests looked at him, there was a skin disease on his forehead. They hurried him out of there; even the king himself wanted to leave quickly because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had afflicted him.
11754	14	26	21	King Uzziah suffered from a skin disease until the day he died. He lived in separate quarters, afflicted by a skin disease and banned from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. His son Jotham was in charge of the palace and ruled over the people of the land.
11755	14	26	22	¶The rest of the events of Uzziah’s reign, from start to finish, were recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
11756	14	26	23	Uzziah passed away and was buried near his ancestors in a cemetery belonging to the kings. (This was because he had a skin disease.) His son Jotham replaced him as king.
11757	14	27	1	¶Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
11758	14	27	2	He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved, just as his father Uzziah had done. (He did not, however, have the audacity to enter the temple.) Yet the people were still sinning.
11759	14	27	3	¶He built the Upper Gate to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and did a lot of work on the wall in the area known as Ophel.
11760	14	27	4	He built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests.
11761	14	27	5	¶He launched a military campaign against the king of the Ammonites and defeated them. That year the Ammonites paid him 100 talents of silver, 10,000 cors of wheat, and 10,000 cors of barley. The Ammonites also paid this same amount of annual tribute the next two years.
11762	14	27	6	¶Jotham grew powerful because he was determined to please the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God.
11763	14	27	7	The rest of the events of Jotham’s reign, including all his military campaigns and his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah.
11764	14	27	8	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem.
11765	14	27	9	Jotham passed away and was buried in the City of David. His son Ahaz replaced him as king.
11766	14	28	1	¶Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what pleased the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, in contrast to his ancestor David.
11767	14	28	2	He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel; he also made images of the Baals.
11768	14	28	3	He offered sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and passed his sons through the fire, a horrible sin practiced by the nations whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> drove out before the Israelites.
11769	14	28	4	He offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
11770	14	28	5	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God handed him over to the king of Syria. The Syrians defeated him and deported many captives to Damascus. He was also handed over to the king of Israel, who thoroughly defeated him.
11771	14	28	6	In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 warriors in Judah, because they had abandoned the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors.
11772	14	28	7	Zikri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed the king’s son Maaseiah, Azrikam, the supervisor of the palace, and Elkanah, the king’s second-in-command.
11773	14	28	8	The Israelites seized from their brothers 200,000 wives, sons, and daughters. They also carried off a huge amount of plunder and took it back to Samaria.
11774	14	28	9	¶Oded, a prophet of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, was there. He went to meet the army as they arrived in Samaria and said to them: “Look, because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of your ancestors was angry with Judah he handed them over to you. You have killed them so mercilessly that God has taken notice.
11775	14	28	10	And now you are planning to enslave the people of Judah and Jerusalem. Yet are you not also guilty before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God?
11776	14	28	11	Now listen to me! Send back those you have seized from your brothers, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is very angry at you!”
11777	14	28	12	So some of the Ephraimite family leaders, Azariah son of Jehochanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jechizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai confronted those returning from the battle.
11778	14	28	13	They said to them, “Don’t bring those captives here! Are you planning on making us even more sinful and guilty before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>? Our guilt is already great and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is very angry at Israel.”
11779	14	28	14	So the soldiers released the captives and the plunder before the officials and the entire assembly.
11780	14	28	15	Men were assigned to take the prisoners and find clothes among the plunder for those who were naked. So they clothed them, supplied them with sandals, gave them food and drink, and provided them with oil to rub on their skin. They put the ones who couldn’t walk on donkeys. They brought them back to their brothers at Jericho, the city of date palm trees, and then returned to Samaria.
11781	14	28	16	¶At that time King Ahaz asked the king of Assyria for help.
11782	14	28	17	The Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and carried off captives.
11783	14	28	18	The Philistines had raided the cities of Judah in the foothills and the Negev. They captured and settled in Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco and its surrounding villages, Timnah and its surrounding villages, and Gimzo and its surrounding villages.
11784	14	28	19	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> humiliated Judah because of King Ahaz of Israel, for he encouraged Judah to sin and was very unfaithful to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11785	14	28	20	King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria came, but he gave him more trouble than support.
11786	14	28	21	Ahaz gathered riches from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, the royal palace, and the officials and gave them to the king of Assyria, but that did not help.
11787	14	28	22	¶During his time of trouble King Ahaz was even more unfaithful to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11788	14	28	23	He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus whom he thought had defeated him. He reasoned, “Since the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me.” But they caused him and all Israel to stumble.
11789	14	28	24	Ahaz gathered the items in God’s temple and removed them. He shut the doors of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and erected altars on every street corner in Jerusalem.
11790	14	28	25	In every city throughout Judah he set up high places to offer sacrifices to other gods. He angered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of his ancestors.
11791	14	28	26	¶The rest of the events of Ahaz’s reign, including his accomplishments from start to finish, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
11792	14	28	27	Ahaz passed away and was buried in the city of Jerusalem; they did not bring him to the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah replaced him as king.
11793	14	29	1	¶Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
11794	14	29	2	He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved, just as his ancestor David had done.
11795	14	29	3	¶In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and repaired them.
11796	14	29	4	He brought in the priests and Levites and assembled them in the square on the east side.
11797	14	29	5	He said to them: “Listen to me, you Levites! Now consecrate yourselves, so you can consecrate the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of your ancestors! Remove from the sanctuary what is ceremonially unclean!
11798	14	29	6	For our fathers were unfaithful; they did what is evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God and abandoned him! They turned away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s dwelling place and rejected him.
11799	14	29	7	They closed the doors of the temple porch and put out the lamps; they did not offer incense or burnt sacrifices in the sanctuary of the God of Israel.
11800	14	29	8	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was angry at Judah and Jerusalem and made them an appalling object of horror at which people hiss out their scorn, as you can see with your own eyes.
11801	14	29	9	Look, our fathers died violently and our sons, daughters, and wives were carried off because of this.
11802	14	29	10	Now I intend to make a covenant with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, so that he may relent from his raging anger.
11803	14	29	11	My sons, do not be negligent now, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has chosen you to stand in his presence, to minister to him, to be his ministers, and offer sacrifices.”
11804	14	29	12	¶The following Levites prepared to carry out the king’s orders: ¶From the Kohathites: Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah;¶from the Merarites: Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel;¶from the Gershonites: Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah;
11805	14	29	13	¶from the descendants of Elizaphan: Shimri and Jeiel;¶from the descendants of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah;
11806	14	29	14	¶from the descendants of Heman: Jehiel and Shimei;¶from the descendants of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel.
11807	14	29	15	¶They assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves. Then they went in to purify the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, just as the king had ordered, in accordance with the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11808	14	29	16	The priests then entered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple to purify it; they brought out to the courtyard of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple every ceremonially unclean thing they discovered inside. The Levites took them out to the Kidron Valley.
11809	14	29	17	On the first day of the first month they began consecrating; by the eighth day of the month they reached the porch of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. For eight more days they consecrated the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. On the sixteenth day of the first month they were finished.
11810	14	29	18	They went to King Hezekiah and said: “We have purified the entire temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, including the altar of burnt sacrifice and all its equipment, and the table for the Bread of the Presence and all its equipment.
11811	14	29	19	We have prepared and consecrated all the items that King Ahaz removed during his reign when he acted unfaithfully. They are in front of the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
11812	14	29	20	¶Early the next morning King Hezekiah assembled the city officials and went up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11813	14	29	21	They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. The king told the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer burnt sacrifices on the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11814	14	29	22	They slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and splashed it on the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and splashed the blood on the altar; next they slaughtered the lambs and splashed the blood on the altar.
11815	14	29	23	Finally they brought the goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they placed their hands on them.
11816	14	29	24	Then the priests slaughtered them. They offered their blood as a sin offering on the altar to make atonement for all Israel, because the king had decreed that the burnt sacrifice and sin offering were for all Israel.
11817	14	29	25	¶Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple with cymbals and stringed instruments, just as David, Gad the king’s prophet, and Nathan the prophet had ordered. (The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had actually given these orders through his prophets.)
11818	14	29	26	The Levites had David’s musical instruments and the priests had trumpets.
11819	14	29	27	Hezekiah ordered the burnt sacrifice to be offered on the altar. As they began to offer the sacrifice, they also began to sing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> accompanied by the trumpets and the musical instruments of King David of Israel.
11820	14	29	28	The entire assembly worshiped, as the singers sang and the trumpeters played. They continued until the burnt sacrifice was completed.
11821	14	29	29	¶When the sacrifices were completed, the king and all who were with him bowed down and worshiped.
11822	14	29	30	King Hezekiah and the officials told the Levites to praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, using the psalms of David and Asaph the prophet. So they joyfully offered praise and bowed down and worshiped.
11823	14	29	31	Hezekiah said, “Now you have consecrated yourselves to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.” So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and whoever desired to do so brought burnt sacrifices.
11824	14	29	32	¶The assembly brought a total of 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs as burnt sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
11825	14	29	33	and 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep were consecrated.
11826	14	29	34	But there were not enough priests to skin all the animals, so their brothers, the Levites, helped them until the work was finished and the priests could consecrate themselves. (The Levites had been more conscientious about consecrating themselves than the priests.)
11827	14	29	35	There was a large number of burnt sacrifices, as well as fat from the peace offerings and drink offerings that accompanied the burnt sacrifices. So the service of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple was reinstituted.
11828	14	29	36	Hezekiah and all the people were happy about what God had done for them, for it had been done quickly.
11829	14	30	1	¶Hezekiah sent messages throughout Israel and Judah; he even wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, summoning them to come to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple in Jerusalem and observe a Passover celebration for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
11830	14	30	2	The king, his officials, and the entire assembly in Jerusalem decided to observe the Passover in the second month.
11831	14	30	3	They were unable to observe it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem.
11832	14	30	4	The proposal seemed appropriate to the king and the entire assembly.
11833	14	30	5	So they sent an edict throughout Israel from Beer Sheba to Dan, summoning the people to come and observe a Passover for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel in Jerusalem, for they had not observed it on a nationwide scale as prescribed in the law.
11834	14	30	6	Messengers delivered the letters from the king and his officials throughout Israel and Judah. ¶This royal edict read: “O Israelites, return to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so he may return to you who have been spared from the kings of Assyria.
11835	14	30	7	Don’t be like your fathers and brothers who were unfaithful to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors, provoking him to destroy them, as you can see.
11836	14	30	8	Now, don’t be stubborn like your fathers! Submit to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and come to his sanctuary which he has permanently consecrated. Serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God so that he might relent from his raging anger.
11837	14	30	9	For if you return to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, your brothers and sons will be shown mercy by their captors and return to this land. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is merciful and compassionate; he will not reject you if you return to him.”
11838	14	30	10	¶The messengers journeyed from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun, but people mocked and ridiculed them.
11839	14	30	11	But some men from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
11840	14	30	12	In Judah God moved the people to unite and carry out the edict of the king and the officers in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message.
11841	14	30	13	A huge crowd assembled in Jerusalem to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.
11842	14	30	14	They removed the altars in Jerusalem; they also removed all the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
11843	14	30	15	¶They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed, so they consecrated themselves and brought burnt sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11844	14	30	16	They stood at their posts according to the regulations outlined in the law of Moses, the man of God. The priests were splashing the blood as the Levites handed it to them.
11845	14	30	17	Because many in the assembly had not consecrated themselves, the Levites slaughtered the Passover lambs of all who were ceremonially unclean and could not consecrate their sacrifice to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11846	14	30	18	The majority of the many people from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun were ceremonially unclean, yet they ate the Passover in violation of what is prescribed in the law. For Hezekiah prayed for them, saying: “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who is good, forgive
11847	14	30	19	everyone who has determined to follow God, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of his ancestors, even if he is not ceremonially clean according to the standards of the temple.”
11848	14	30	20	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responded favorably to Hezekiah and forgave the people.
11849	14	30	21	¶The Israelites who were in Jerusalem observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. The Levites and priests were praising the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> every day with all their might.
11850	14	30	22	Hezekiah expressed his appreciation to all the Levites, who demonstrated great skill in serving the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They feasted for the seven days of the festival, and were making peace offerings and giving thanks to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors.
11851	14	30	23	¶The entire assembly then decided to celebrate for seven more days; so they joyfully celebrated for seven more days.
11852	14	30	24	King Hezekiah of Judah supplied 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for the assembly, while the officials supplied them with 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep. Many priests consecrated themselves.
11853	14	30	25	The celebration included the entire assembly of Judah, the priests, the Levites, the entire assembly of those who came from Israel, the resident foreigners who came from the land of Israel and those who were residents of Judah.
11854	14	30	26	There was a great celebration in Jerusalem, unlike anything that had occurred in Jerusalem since the time of King Solomon son of David of Israel.
11855	14	30	27	The priests and Levites got up and pronounced blessings on the people. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responded favorably to them as their prayers reached his holy dwelling place in heaven.
11856	14	31	1	¶When all this was over, the Israelites who were in the cities of Judah went out and smashed the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and demolished all the high places and altars throughout Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. Then all the Israelites returned to their own homes in their cities.
11857	14	31	2	¶Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and Levites to do their assigned tasks – to offer burnt sacrifices and present offerings and to serve, give thanks, and offer praise in the gates of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sanctuary.
11858	14	31	3	¶The king contributed some of what he owned for burnt sacrifices, including the morning and evening burnt sacrifices and the burnt sacrifices made on Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and at other appointed times prescribed in the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11859	14	31	4	He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to contribute the portion prescribed for the priests and Levites so they might be obedient to the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11860	14	31	5	When the edict was issued, the Israelites freely contributed the initial portion of their grain, wine, olive oil, honey, and all the produce of their fields. They brought a tenth of everything, which added up to a huge amount.
11861	14	31	6	The Israelites and people of Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also contributed a tenth of their cattle and sheep, as well as a tenth of the holy items consecrated to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God. They brought them and placed them in many heaps.
11862	14	31	7	In the third month they began piling their contributions in heaps and finished in the seventh month.
11863	14	31	8	When Hezekiah and the officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and pronounced blessings on his people Israel.
11864	14	31	9	¶When Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps,
11865	14	31	10	Azariah, the head priest from the family of Zadok, said to him, “Since the contributions began arriving in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, we have had plenty to eat and have a large quantity left over. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has blessed his people, and this large amount remains.”
11866	14	31	11	Hezekiah ordered that storerooms be prepared in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. When this was done,
11867	14	31	12	they brought in the contributions, tithes, and consecrated items that had been offered. Konaniah, a Levite, was in charge of all this, assisted by his brother Shimei.
11868	14	31	13	Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath, and Benaiah worked under the supervision of Konaniah and his brother Shimei, as directed by King Hezekiah and Azariah, the supervisor of God’s temple.
11869	14	31	14	¶Kore son of Imnah, a Levite and the guard on the east side, was in charge of the voluntary offerings made to God and disbursed the contributions made to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and the consecrated items.
11870	14	31	15	In the cities of the priests, Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah faithfully assisted him in making disbursements to their fellow priests according to their divisions, regardless of age.
11871	14	31	16	They made disbursements to all the males three years old and up who were listed in the genealogical records – to all who would enter the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple to serve on a daily basis and fulfill their duties as assigned to their divisions.
11872	14	31	17	They made disbursements to the priests listed in the genealogical records by their families, and to the Levites twenty years old and up, according to their duties as assigned to their divisions,
11873	14	31	18	and to all the infants, wives, sons, and daughters of the entire assembly listed in the genealogical records, for they faithfully consecrated themselves.
11874	14	31	19	As for the descendants of Aaron, the priests who lived in the outskirts of all their cities, men were assigned to disburse portions to every male among the priests and to every Levite listed in the genealogical records.
11875	14	31	20	¶This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God considered good and right and faithful.
11876	14	31	21	He wholeheartedly and successfully reinstituted service in God’s temple and obedience to the law, in order to follow his God.
11877	14	32	1	¶After these faithful deeds were accomplished, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah. He besieged the fortified cities, intending to seize them.
11878	14	32	2	When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had invaded and intended to attack Jerusalem,
11879	14	32	3	he consulted with his advisers and military officers about stopping up the springs outside the city, and they supported him.
11880	14	32	4	A large number of people gathered together and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the district. They reasoned, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?”
11881	14	32	5	Hezekiah energetically rebuilt every broken wall. He erected towers and an outer wall, and fortified the terrace of the City of David. He made many weapons and shields.
11882	14	32	6	¶He appointed military officers over the army and assembled them in the square at the city gate. He encouraged them, saying,
11883	14	32	7	“Be strong and brave! Don’t be afraid and don’t panic because of the king of Assyria and this huge army that is with him! We have with us one who is stronger than those who are with him.
11884	14	32	8	He has with him mere human strength, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God is with us to help us and fight our battles!” The army was encouraged by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.
11885	14	32	9	¶Afterward King Sennacherib of Assyria, while attacking Lachish with all his military might, sent his messengers to Jerusalem. The message was for King Hezekiah of Judah and all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem. It read:
11886	14	32	10	“This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says: ‘Why are you so confident that you remain in Jerusalem while it is under siege?
11887	14	32	11	Hezekiah says, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God will rescue us from the power of the king of Assyria.” But he is misleading you and you will die of hunger and thirst!
11888	14	32	12	Hezekiah is the one who eliminated the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s high places and altars and then told Judah and Jerusalem, “At one altar you must worship and offer sacrifices.”
11889	14	32	13	Are you not aware of what I and my predecessors have done to all the nations of the surrounding lands? Have the gods of the surrounding lands actually been able to rescue their lands from my power?
11890	14	32	14	Who among all the gods of these nations whom my predecessors annihilated was able to rescue his people from my power, that your God would be able to rescue you from my power?
11891	14	32	15	Now don’t let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this. Don’t believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to rescue his people from my power or the power of my predecessors. So how can your gods rescue you from my power?’”
11892	14	32	16	¶Sennacherib’s servants further insulted the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God and his servant Hezekiah.
11893	14	32	17	He wrote letters mocking the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel and insulting him with these words: “The gods of the surrounding nations could not rescue their people from my power. Neither can Hezekiah’s god rescue his people from my power.”
11894	14	32	18	They called out loudly in the Judahite dialect to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, trying to scare and terrify them so they could seize the city.
11895	14	32	19	They talked about the God of Jerusalem as if he were one of the man-made gods of the nations of the earth.
11896	14	32	20	¶King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed about this and cried out to heaven.
11897	14	32	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent a messenger and he wiped out all the soldiers, princes, and officers in the army of the king of Assyria. So Sennacherib returned home humiliated. When he entered the temple of his god, some of his own sons struck him down with the sword.
11898	14	32	22	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> delivered Hezekiah and the residents of Jerusalem from the power of King Sennacherib of Assyria and from all the other nations. He made them secure on every side.
11899	14	32	23	Many were bringing presents to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in Jerusalem and precious gifts to King Hezekiah of Judah. From that time on he was respected by all the nations.
11900	14	32	24	¶In those days Hezekiah was stricken with a terminal illness. He prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who answered him and gave him a sign confirming that he would be healed.
11901	14	32	25	But Hezekiah was ungrateful; he had a proud attitude, provoking God to be angry at him, as well as Judah and Jerusalem.
11902	14	32	26	But then Hezekiah and the residents of Jerusalem humbled themselves and abandoned their pride, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was not angry with them for the rest of Hezekiah’s reign.
11903	14	32	27	¶Hezekiah was very wealthy and greatly respected. He made storehouses for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all his other valuable possessions.
11904	14	32	28	He made storerooms for the harvest of grain, wine, and olive oil, and stalls for all his various kinds of livestock and his flocks.
11905	14	32	29	He built royal cities and owned a large number of sheep and cattle, for God gave him a huge amount of possessions.
11906	14	32	30	¶Hezekiah dammed up the source of the waters of the Upper Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the City of David. Hezekiah succeeded in all that he did.
11907	14	32	31	So when the envoys arrived from the Babylonian officials to visit him and inquire about the sign that occurred in the land, God left him alone to test him, in order to know his true motives.
11908	14	32	32	¶The rest of the events of Hezekiah’s reign, including his faithful deeds, are recorded in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz, included in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
11909	14	32	33	Hezekiah passed away and was buried on the ascent of the tombs of the descendants of David. All the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem buried him with great honor. His son Manasseh replaced him as king.
11910	14	33	1	¶Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
11911	14	33	2	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and committed the same horrible sins practiced by the nations whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> drove out ahead of the Israelites.
11912	14	33	3	He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he set up altars for the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the stars in the sky and worshiped them.
11913	14	33	4	He built altars in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, about which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had said, “Jerusalem will be my permanent home.”
11914	14	33	5	In the two courtyards of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple he built altars for all the stars in the sky.
11915	14	33	6	He passed his sons through the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and practiced divination, omen reading, and sorcery. He set up a ritual pit to conjure up underworld spirits and appointed magicians to supervise it. He did a great amount of evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and angered him.
11916	14	33	7	He put an idolatrous image he had made in God’s temple, about which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, “This temple in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will be my permanent home.
11917	14	33	8	I will not make Israel again leave the land I gave to their ancestors, provided that they carefully obey all I commanded them, the whole law, the rules and regulations given through Moses.”
11918	14	33	9	But Manasseh misled the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem so that they sinned more than the nations whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had destroyed ahead of the Israelites.
11919	14	33	10	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> confronted Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.
11920	14	33	11	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought against them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria. They seized Manasseh, put hooks in his nose, bound him with bronze chains, and carried him away to Babylon.
11921	14	33	12	In his pain Manasseh asked the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God for mercy and truly humbled himself before the God of his ancestors.
11922	14	33	13	When he prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responded to him and answered favorably his cry for mercy. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh realized that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the true God.
11923	14	33	14	¶After this Manasseh built up the outer wall of the City of David on the west side of the Gihon in the valley to the entrance of the Fish Gate and all around the terrace; he made it much higher. He placed army officers in all the fortified cities in Judah.
11924	14	33	15	¶He removed the foreign gods and images from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and all the altars he had built on the hill of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and in Jerusalem; he threw them outside the city.
11925	14	33	16	He erected the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and offered on it peace offerings and thank offerings. He told the people of Judah to serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
11926	14	33	17	However, the people continued to offer sacrifices at the high places, but only to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God.
11927	14	33	18	¶The rest of the events of Manasseh’s reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the prophets spoke to him in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
11928	14	33	19	The Annals of the Prophets include his prayer, give an account of how the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responded to it, record all his sins and unfaithful acts, and identify the sites where he built high places and erected Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself.
11929	14	33	20	Manasseh passed away and was buried in his palace. His son Amon replaced him as king.
11930	14	33	21	¶Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem.
11931	14	33	22	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, just like his father Manasseh had done. Amon offered sacrifices to all the idols his father Manasseh had made, and worshiped them.
11932	14	33	23	He did not humble himself before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as his father Manasseh had done. Amon was guilty of great sin.
11933	14	33	24	His servants conspired against him and killed him in his palace.
11934	14	33	25	The people of the land executed all who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
11935	14	34	1	¶Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
11936	14	34	2	He did what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> approved and followed in his ancestor David’s footsteps; he did not deviate to the right or the left.
11937	14	34	3	¶In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his ancestor David. In his twelfth year he began ridding Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, Asherah poles, idols, and images.
11938	14	34	4	He ordered the altars of the Baals to be torn down, and broke the incense altars that were above them. He smashed the Asherah poles, idols and images, crushed them up and sprinkled the dust over the tombs of those who had sacrificed to them.
11939	14	34	5	He burned the bones of the pagan priests on their altars; he purified Judah and Jerusalem.
11940	14	34	6	In the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them,
11941	14	34	7	he tore down the altars and Asherah poles, demolished the idols, and smashed all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
11942	14	34	8	¶In the eighteenth year of his reign, he continued his policy of purifying the land and the temple. He sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the city official, and Joah son of Joahaz the secretary to repair the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God.
11943	14	34	9	They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the silver that had been brought to God’s temple. The Levites who guarded the door had collected it from the people of Manasseh and Ephraim and from all who were left in Israel, as well as from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the residents of Jerusalem.
11944	14	34	10	They handed it over to the construction foremen assigned to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. They in turn paid the temple workers to restore and repair it.
11945	14	34	11	They gave money to the craftsmen and builders to buy chiseled stone and wood for the braces and rafters of the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into disrepair.
11946	14	34	12	The men worked faithfully. Their supervisors were Jahath and Obadiah (Levites descended from Merari), as well as Zechariah and Meshullam (descendants of Kohath). The Levites, all of whom were skilled musicians,
11947	14	34	13	supervised the laborers and all the foremen on their various jobs. Some of the Levites were scribes, officials, and guards.
11948	14	34	14	¶When they took out the silver that had been brought to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, Hilkiah the priest found the law scroll the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had given to Moses.
11949	14	34	15	Hilkiah informed Shaphan the scribe, “I found the law scroll in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.” Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan.
11950	14	34	16	Shaphan brought the scroll to the king and reported, “Your servants are doing everything assigned to them.
11951	14	34	17	They melted down the silver in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and handed it over to the supervisors and the construction foremen.”
11952	14	34	18	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll.” Shaphan read it out loud before the king.
11953	14	34	19	When the king heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes.
11954	14	34	20	The king ordered Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant,
11955	14	34	21	“Go, ask the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on behalf of me and those who remain in Israel and Judah about the words of this scroll that has been discovered. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s great fury has been ignited against us, because our ancestors did not obey the word of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by living according to all that is written in this scroll!”
11956	14	34	22	¶So Hilkiah and the others sent by the king went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the supervisor of the wardrobe. (She lived in Jerusalem in the Mishneh district.) They stated their business,
11957	14	34	23	and she said to them: “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel says: ‘Say this to the man who sent you to me:
11958	14	34	24	“This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‘I am about to bring disaster on this place and its residents, all the curses that are recorded in the scroll which they read before the king of Judah.
11959	14	34	25	This will happen because they have abandoned me and offered sacrifices to other gods, angering me with all the idols they have made. My anger will ignite against this place and will not be extinguished!’”
11960	14	34	26	Say this to the king of Judah, who sent you to seek an oracle from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel says concerning the words you have heard:
11961	14	34	27	‘You displayed a sensitive spirit and humbled yourself before God when you heard his words concerning this place and its residents. You humbled yourself before me, tore your clothes and wept before me, and I have heard you,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
11962	14	34	28	‘Therefore I will allow you to die and be buried in peace. You will not have to witness all the disaster I will bring on this place and its residents.’”’” Then they reported back to the king.
11963	14	34	29	¶The king summoned all the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem.
11964	14	34	30	The king went up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, accompanied by all the people of Judah, the residents of Jerusalem, the priests, and the Levites. All the people were there, from the oldest to the youngest. He read aloud all the words of the scroll of the covenant that had been discovered in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11965	14	34	31	The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, agreeing to follow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and to obey his commandments, laws, and rules with all his heart and being, by carrying out the terms of this covenant recorded on this scroll.
11966	14	34	32	He made all who were in Jerusalem and Benjamin agree to it. The residents of Jerusalem acted in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.
11967	14	34	33	Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the areas belonging to the Israelites and encouraged all who were in Israel to worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God. Throughout the rest of his reign they did not turn aside from following the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors.
11968	14	35	1	¶Josiah observed a Passover festival for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in Jerusalem. They slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the first month.
11969	14	35	2	He appointed the priests to fulfill their duties and encouraged them to carry out their service in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
11970	14	35	3	He told the Levites, who instructed all Israel about things consecrated to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Place the holy ark in the temple which King Solomon son of David of Israel built. Don’t carry it on your shoulders. Now serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and his people Israel!
11971	14	35	4	Prepare yourselves by your families according to your divisions, as instructed in writing by King David of Israel and his son Solomon.
11972	14	35	5	Stand in the sanctuary and, together with the Levites, represent the family divisions of your countrymen.
11973	14	35	6	Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves, and make preparations for your countrymen to celebrate according to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message which came through Moses.”
11974	14	35	7	¶From his own royal flocks and herds, Josiah supplied the people with 30,000 lambs and goats for the Passover sacrifice, as well as 3,000 cattle.
11975	14	35	8	His officials also willingly contributed to the people, priests, and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the leaders of God’s temple, gave the priests 2,600 Passover sacrifices and 300 cattle.
11976	14	35	9	Konaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, along with Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the officials of the Levites, supplied the Levites with 5,000 Passover sacrifices and 500 cattle.
11977	14	35	10	Preparations were made, and the priests stood at their posts and the Levites in their divisions as prescribed by the king.
11978	14	35	11	They slaughtered the Passover lambs and the priests splashed the blood, while the Levites skinned the animals.
11979	14	35	12	They reserved the burnt offerings and the cattle for the family divisions of the people to present to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, as prescribed in the scroll of Moses.
11980	14	35	13	They cooked the Passover sacrifices over the open fire as prescribed and cooked the consecrated offerings in pots, kettles, and pans. They quickly served them to all the people.
11981	14	35	14	Afterward they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were offering burnt sacrifices and fat portions until evening. The Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
11982	14	35	15	The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, manned their posts, as prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s prophet. The guards at the various gates did not need to leave their posts, for their fellow Levites made preparations for them.
11983	14	35	16	So all the preparations for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s service were made that day, as the Passover was observed and the burnt sacrifices were offered on the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, as prescribed by King Josiah.
11984	14	35	17	So the Israelites who were present observed the Passover at that time, as well as the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
11985	14	35	18	A Passover like this had not been observed in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel had observed a Passover like the one celebrated by Josiah, the priests, the Levites, all the people of Judah and Israel who were there, and the residents of Jerusalem.
11986	14	35	19	This Passover was observed in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign.
11987	14	35	20	¶After Josiah had done all this for the temple, King Necho of Egypt marched up to do battle at Carchemish on the Euphrates River. Josiah marched out to oppose him.
11988	14	35	21	Necho sent messengers to him, saying, “Why are you opposing me, O king of Judah? I am not attacking you today, but the kingdom with which I am at war. God told me to hurry. Stop opposing God, who is with me, or else he will destroy you.”
11989	14	35	22	But Josiah did not turn back from him; he disguised himself for battle. He did not take seriously the words of Necho which he had received from God; he went to fight him in the Plain of Megiddo.
11990	14	35	23	Archers shot King Josiah; the king ordered his servants, “Take me out of this chariot, for I am seriously wounded.”
11991	14	35	24	So his servants took him out of the chariot, put him in another chariot that he owned, and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors; all the people of Judah and Jerusalem mourned Josiah.
11992	14	35	25	Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah which all the male and female singers use to mourn Josiah to this very day. It has become customary in Israel to sing these; they are recorded in the Book of Laments.
11993	14	35	26	¶The rest of the events of Josiah’s reign, including the faithful acts he did in obedience to what is written in the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>
11994	14	35	27	and his accomplishments, from start to finish, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
11995	14	36	1	¶The people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in his father’s place in Jerusalem.
11996	14	36	2	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
11997	14	36	3	The king of Egypt prevented him from ruling in Jerusalem and imposed on the land a special tax of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
11998	14	36	4	The king of Egypt made Jehoahaz’s brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Necho seized his brother Jehoahaz and took him to Egypt.
11999	14	36	5	¶Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God.
12000	14	36	6	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked him, bound him with bronze chains, and carried him away to Babylon.
12001	14	36	7	Nebuchadnezzar took some of the items in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple to Babylon and put them in his palace there.
12002	14	36	8	¶The rest of the events of Jehoiakim’s reign, including the horrible sins he committed and his shortcomings, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Israel and Judah. His son Jehoiachin replaced him as king.
12003	14	36	9	¶Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
12004	14	36	10	At the beginning of the year King Nebuchadnezzar ordered him to be brought to Babylon, along with the valuable items in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. In his place he made his relative Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.
12005	14	36	11	¶Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem.
12006	14	36	12	He did evil in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s spokesman.
12007	14	36	13	He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him vow allegiance in the name of God. He was stubborn and obstinate, and refused to return to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
12008	14	36	14	All the leaders of the priests and people became more unfaithful and committed the same horrible sins practiced by the nations. They defiled the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.
12009	14	36	15	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of their ancestors continually warned them through his messengers, for he felt compassion for his people and his dwelling place.
12010	14	36	16	But they mocked God’s messengers, despised his warnings, and ridiculed his prophets. Finally the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> got very angry at his people and there was no one who could prevent his judgment.
12011	14	36	17	He brought against them the king of the Babylonians, who slaughtered their young men in their temple. He did not spare young men or women, or even the old and aging. God handed everyone over to him.
12012	14	36	18	He carried away to Babylon all the items in God’s temple, whether large or small, as well as what was in the treasuries of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and in the treasuries of the king and his officials.
12013	14	36	19	They burned down the God’s temple and tore down the wall of Jerusalem. They burned all its fortified buildings and destroyed all its valuable items.
12014	14	36	20	He deported to Babylon all who escaped the sword. They served him and his sons until the Persian kingdom rose to power.
12015	14	36	21	This took place to fulfill the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message spoken through Jeremiah and lasted until the land experienced its sabbatical years. All the time of its desolation the land rested in order to fulfill the seventy years.
12016	14	36	22	¶In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in fulfillment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message spoken through Jeremiah, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> motivated King Cyrus of Persia to issue a proclamation throughout his kingdom and also to put it in writing. It read:
12017	14	36	23	¶“This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: ¶‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has appointed me to build a temple for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Anyone of his people among you may go up there and may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God be with him!”
12018	15	1	1	¶In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in fulfillment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message spoken through Jeremiah, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> motivated King Cyrus of Persia to issue a proclamation throughout his kingdom and also to put it in writing. It read:
12019	15	1	2	¶“This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: ¶“‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has appointed me to build a temple for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
12020	15	1	3	Anyone of his people among you (may his God be with him!) may go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and may build the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel – he is the God who is in Jerusalem.
12021	15	1	4	Anyone who survives in any of those places where he is a resident foreigner must be helped by his neighbors with silver, gold, equipment, and animals, along with voluntary offerings for the temple of God which is in Jerusalem.’”
12022	15	1	5	¶Then the leaders of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and the Levites – all those whose mind God had stirred – got ready to go up in order to build the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in Jerusalem.
12023	15	1	6	All their neighbors assisted them with silver utensils, gold, equipment, animals, and expensive gifts, not to mention all the voluntary offerings.
12024	15	1	7	¶Then King Cyrus brought out the vessels of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple which Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem and had displayed in the temple of his gods.
12025	15	1	8	King Cyrus of Persia entrusted them to Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the leader of the Judahite exiles.
12026	15	1	9	¶The inventory of these items was as follows:‡30 gold basins, ‡1,000 silver basins,‡29 silver utensils,
12027	15	1	10	‡30 gold bowls,‡410 other silver bowls,‡and 1,000 other vessels.
12028	15	1	11	¶All these gold and silver vessels totaled 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought them all along when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
12029	15	2	1	¶These are the people of the province who were going up, from the captives of the exile whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had forced into exile in Babylon. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city.
12030	15	2	2	They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. ¶The number of Israelites was as follows:

12086	15	2	58	¶All the temple servants and the descendants of the servants of Solomon: 392.
12087	15	2	59	¶These are the ones that came up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon, and Immer (although they were unable to certify their family connection or their ancestry, as to whether they really were from Israel):
12088	15	2	60	¶the descendants of Delaiah, the descendants of Tobiah, and the descendants of Nekoda: 652.
12089	15	2	61	¶And from among the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, and the descendants of Barzillai (who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by that name).
12090	15	2	62	They searched for their records in the genealogical materials, but did not find them. They were therefore excluded from the priesthood.
12091	15	2	63	The governor instructed them not to eat any of the sacred food until there was a priest who could consult the Urim and Thummim.
12092	15	2	64	¶The entire group numbered 42,360,
12093	15	2	65	not counting their male and female servants, who numbered 7,337. They also had 200 male and female singers
12094	15	2	66	and 736 horses, 245 mules,
12095	15	2	67	435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
12096	15	2	68	When they came to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple in Jerusalem, some of the family leaders offered voluntary offerings for the temple of God in order to rebuild it on its site.
12097	15	2	69	As they were able, they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 drachmas of gold, 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 priestly robes.
12098	15	2	70	¶The priests, the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their towns, and all the rest of Israel lived in their towns.
12099	15	3	1	¶When the seventh month arrived and the Israelites were living in their towns, the people assembled in Jerusalem.
12100	15	3	2	Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his priestly colleagues and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his colleagues started to build the altar of the God of Israel so they could offer burnt offerings on it as required by the law of Moses the man of God.
12101	15	3	3	They established the altar on its foundations, even though they were in terror of the local peoples, and they offered burnt offerings on it to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, both the morning and the evening offerings.
12102	15	3	4	They observed the Feast of Shelters as required and offered the proper number of daily burnt offerings according to the requirement for each day.
12103	15	3	5	Afterward they offered the continual burnt offerings and those for the new moons and those for all the holy assemblies of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and all those that were being voluntarily offered to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
12104	15	3	6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. However, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple was not at that time established.
12105	15	3	7	¶So they provided money for the masons and carpenters, and food, beverages, and olive oil for the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar timber from Lebanon to the seaport at Joppa, in accord with the edict of King Cyrus of Persia.
12106	15	3	8	In the second year after they had come to the temple of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak initiated the work, along with the rest of their associates, the priests and the Levites, and all those who were coming to Jerusalem from the exile. They appointed the Levites who were at least twenty years old to take charge of the work on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
12107	15	3	9	So Jeshua appointed both his sons and his relatives, Kadmiel and his sons (the sons of Yehudah), to take charge of the workers in the temple of God, along with the sons of Henadad, their sons, and their relatives the Levites.
12108	15	3	10	When the builders established the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, the priests, ceremonially attired and with their clarions, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with their cymbals, stood to praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> according to the instructions left by King David of Israel.
12109	15	3	11	With antiphonal response they sang, praising and glorifying the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>:‡“For he is good;‡his loyal love toward Israel is forever.” ¶All the people gave a loud shout as they praised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> when the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was established.
12110	15	3	12	Many of the priests, the Levites, and the leaders – older people who had seen with their own eyes the former temple while it was still established – were weeping loudly, and many others raised their voice in a joyous shout.
12111	15	3	13	People were unable to tell the difference between the sound of joyous shouting and the sound of the people’s weeping, for the people were shouting so loudly that the sound was heard a long way off.
12112	15	4	1	¶When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin learned that the former exiles were building a temple for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel,
12113	15	4	2	they came to Zerubbabel and the leaders and said to them, “Let us help you build, for like you we seek your God and we have been sacrificing to him from the time of King Esarhaddon of Assyria, who brought us here.”
12114	15	4	3	But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the leaders of Israel said to them, “You have no right to help us build the temple of our God. We will build it by ourselves for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, just as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, has commanded us.”
12115	15	4	4	Then the local people began to discourage the people of Judah and to dishearten them from building.
12116	15	4	5	They were hiring advisers to oppose them, so as to frustrate their plans, throughout the time of King Cyrus of Persia until the reign of King Darius of Persia.
12117	15	4	6	¶At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus they filed an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
12118	15	4	7	And during the reign of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their colleagues wrote to King Artaxerxes of Persia. This letter was first written in Aramaic but then translated.¶[Aramaic:]
12119	15	4	8	¶Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter concerning Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows:
12120	15	4	9	From Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues – the judges, the rulers, the officials, the secretaries, the Erechites, the Babylonians, the people of Susa (that is, the Elamites),
12121	15	4	10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and other places in Trans-Euphrates.
12122	15	4	11	(This is a copy of the letter they sent to him:)¶“To King Artaxerxes, from your servants in Trans-Euphrates:
12123	15	4	12	Now let the king be aware that the Jews who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and odious city. They are completing its walls and repairing its foundations.
12124	15	4	13	Let the king also be aware that if this city is built and its walls are completed, no more tax, custom, or toll will be paid, and the royal treasury will suffer loss.
12125	15	4	14	In light of the fact that we are loyal to the king, and since it does not seem appropriate to us that the king should sustain damage, we are sending the king this information
12126	15	4	15	so that he may initiate a search of the records of his predecessors and discover in those records that this city is rebellious and injurious to both kings and provinces, producing internal revolts from long ago. It is for this very reason that this city was destroyed.
12127	15	4	16	We therefore are informing the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, you will not retain control of this portion of Trans-Euphrates.”
12128	15	4	17	¶The king sent the following response:¶“To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues who live in Samaria and other parts of Trans-Euphrates: Greetings!
12129	15	4	18	The letter you sent to us has been translated and read in my presence.
12130	15	4	19	So I gave orders, and it was determined that this city from long ago has been engaging in insurrection against kings. It has continually engaged in rebellion and revolt.
12131	15	4	20	Powerful kings have been over Jerusalem who ruled throughout the entire Trans-Euphrates and who were the beneficiaries of tribute, custom, and toll.
12132	15	4	21	Now give orders that these men cease their work and that this city not be rebuilt until such time as I so instruct.
12133	15	4	22	Exercise appropriate caution so that there is no negligence in this matter. Why should danger increase to the point that kings sustain damage?”
12134	15	4	23	¶Then, as soon as the copy of the letter from King Artaxerxes was read in the presence of Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their colleagues, they proceeded promptly to the Jews in Jerusalem and stopped them with threat of armed force.
12135	15	4	24	¶So the work on the temple of God in Jerusalem came to a halt. It remained halted until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.
12136	15	5	1	¶Then the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied concerning the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.
12137	15	5	2	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak began to rebuild the temple of God in Jerusalem. The prophets of God were with them, supporting them.
12138	15	5	3	¶At that time Tattenai governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and their colleagues came to them and asked, “Who gave you authority to rebuild this temple and to complete this structure?”
12139	15	5	4	They also asked them, “What are the names of the men who are building this edifice?”
12140	15	5	5	But God was watching over the elders of Judah, and they were not stopped until a report could be dispatched to Darius and a letter could be sent back concerning this.
12141	15	5	6	¶This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and his colleagues who were the officials of Trans-Euphrates sent to King Darius.
12142	15	5	7	The report they sent to him was written as follows: ¶“To King Darius: All greetings!
12143	15	5	8	Let it be known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the temple of the great God. It is being built with large stones, and timbers are being placed in the walls. This work is being done with all diligence and is prospering in their hands.
12144	15	5	9	We inquired of those elders, asking them, ‘Who gave you the authority to rebuild this temple and to complete this structure?’
12145	15	5	10	We also inquired of their names in order to inform you, so that we might write the names of the men who were their leaders.
12146	15	5	11	They responded to us in the following way: ‘We are servants of the God of heaven and earth. We are rebuilding the temple which was previously built many years ago. A great king of Israel built it and completed it.
12147	15	5	12	But after our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he delivered them into the hands of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this temple and exiled the people to Babylon.
12148	15	5	13	But in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon, King Cyrus enacted a decree to rebuild this temple of God.
12149	15	5	14	Even the gold and silver vessels of the temple of God that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and had brought to the palace of Babylon – even those things King Cyrus brought from the palace of Babylon and presented to a man by the name of Sheshbazzar whom he had appointed as governor.
12150	15	5	15	He said to him, “Take these vessels and go deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt in its proper location.”
12151	15	5	16	Then this Sheshbazzar went and laid the foundations of the temple of God in Jerusalem. From that time to the present moment it has been in the process of being rebuilt, although it is not yet finished.’
12152	15	5	17	¶“Now if the king is so inclined, let a search be conducted in the royal archives there in Babylon in order to determine whether King Cyrus did in fact issue orders for this temple of God to be rebuilt in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us a decision concerning this matter.”
12153	15	6	1	¶So Darius the king issued orders, and they searched in the archives of the treasury which were deposited there in Babylon.
12154	15	6	2	A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana which is in the province of Media, and it was inscribed as follows:¶“Memorandum:
12155	15	6	3	In the first year of his reign, King Cyrus gave orders concerning the temple of God in Jerusalem: ‘Let the temple be rebuilt as a place where sacrifices are offered. Let its foundations be set in place. Its height is to be ninety feet and its width ninety feet,
12156	15	6	4	with three layers of large stones and one layer of timber. The expense is to be subsidized by the royal treasury.
12157	15	6	5	Furthermore let the gold and silver vessels of the temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar brought from the temple in Jerusalem and carried to Babylon, be returned and brought to their proper place in the temple in Jerusalem. Let them be deposited in the temple of God.’
12158	15	6	6	¶“Now Tattenai governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues, the officials of Trans-Euphrates – all of you stay far away from there!
12159	15	6	7	Leave the work on this temple of God alone. Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this temple of God in its proper place.
12160	15	6	8	¶“I also hereby issue orders as to what you are to do with those elders of the Jews in order to rebuild this temple of God. From the royal treasury, from the taxes of Trans-Euphrates the complete costs are to be given to these men, so that there may be no interruption of the work.
12161	15	6	9	Whatever is needed – whether oxen or rams or lambs for burnt offerings for the God of heaven or wheat or salt or wine or oil, as required by the priests who are in Jerusalem – must be given to them daily without any neglect,
12162	15	6	10	so that they may be offering incense to the God of heaven and may be praying for the good fortune of the king and his family.
12163	15	6	11	¶“I hereby give orders that if anyone changes this directive a beam is to be pulled out from his house and he is to be raised up and impaled on it, and his house is to be reduced to a rubbish heap for this indiscretion.
12164	15	6	12	May God who makes his name to reside there overthrow any king or nation who reaches out to cause such change so as to destroy this temple of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have given orders. Let them be carried out with precision!”
12165	15	6	13	¶Then Tattenai governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and their colleagues acted accordingly – with precision, just as Darius the king had given instructions.
12166	15	6	14	The elders of the Jews continued building and prospering, while at the same time Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo continued prophesying. They built and brought it to completion by the command of the God of Israel and by the command of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
12167	15	6	15	They finished this temple on the third day of the month Adar, which is the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
12168	15	6	16	¶The people of Israel – the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the exiles – observed the dedication of this temple of God with joy.
12169	15	6	17	For the dedication of this temple of God they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve male goats for the sin of all Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
12170	15	6	18	They appointed the priests by their divisions and the Levites by their divisions over the worship of God at Jerusalem, in accord with the book of Moses.
12171	15	6	19	The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
12172	15	6	20	The priests and the Levites had purified themselves, every last one, and they all were ceremonially pure. They sacrificed the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their colleagues the priests, and for themselves.
12173	15	6	21	The Israelites who were returning from the exile ate it, along with all those who had joined them in separating themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land to seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
12174	15	6	22	They observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had given them joy and had changed the opinion of the king of Assyria toward them, so that he assisted them in the work on the temple of God, the God of Israel.
12175	15	7	1	¶Now after these things had happened, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra came up from Babylon. Ezra was the son of Seraiah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Hilkiah,
12176	15	7	2	who was the son of Shallum, who was the son of Zadok, who was the son of Ahitub,
12177	15	7	3	who was the son of Amariah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Meraioth,
12178	15	7	4	who was the son of Zerahiah, who was the son of Uzzi, who was the son of Bukki,
12179	15	7	5	who was the son of Abishua, who was the son of Phinehas, who was the son of Eleazar, who was the son of Aaron the chief priest.
12180	15	7	6	This Ezra is the one who came up from Babylon. He was a scribe who was skilled in the law of Moses which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel had given. The king supplied him with everything he requested, for the hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God was on him.
12181	15	7	7	In the seventh year of King Artaxerxes, Ezra brought up to Jerusalem some of the Israelites and some of the priests, the Levites, the attendants, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants.
12182	15	7	8	He entered Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.
12183	15	7	9	On the first day of the first month he had determined to make the ascent from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he arrived at Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was on him.
12184	15	7	10	Now Ezra had dedicated himself to the study of the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, to its observance, and to teaching its statutes and judgments in Israel.
12185	15	7	11	¶What follows is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priestly scribe. Ezra was a scribe in matters pertaining to the commandments of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and his statutes over Israel:
12186	15	7	12	¶“Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven:
12187	15	7	13	I have now issued a decree that anyone in my kingdom from the people of Israel – even the priests and Levites – who wishes to do so may go up with you to Jerusalem.
12188	15	7	14	You are authorized by the king and his seven advisers to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your possession,
12189	15	7	15	and to bring silver and gold which the king and his advisers have freely contributed to the God of Israel, who resides in Jerusalem,
12190	15	7	16	along with all the silver and gold that you may collect throughout all the province of Babylon and the contributions of the people and the priests for the temple of their God which is in Jerusalem.
12191	15	7	17	With this money you should be sure to purchase bulls, rams, and lambs, along with the appropriate meal offerings and libations. You should bring them to the altar of the temple of your God which is in Jerusalem.
12192	15	7	18	You may do whatever seems appropriate to you and your colleagues with the rest of the silver and the gold, in keeping with the will of your God.
12193	15	7	19	Deliver to the God of Jerusalem the vessels that are given to you for the service of the temple of your God.
12194	15	7	20	The rest of the needs for the temple of your God that you may have to supply, you may do so from the royal treasury.
12195	15	7	21	¶“I, King Artaxerxes, hereby issue orders to all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates, that you precisely execute all that Ezra the priestly scribe of the law of the God of heaven may request of you –
12196	15	7	22	up to 100 talents of silver, 100 cors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of olive oil, and unlimited salt.
12197	15	7	23	Everything that the God of heaven has required should be precisely done for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should there be wrath against the empire of the king and his sons?
12198	15	7	24	Furthermore, be aware of the fact that you have no authority to impose tax, tribute, or toll on any of the priests, the Levites, the musicians, the doorkeepers, the temple servants, or the attendants at the temple of this God.
12199	15	7	25	¶“Now you, Ezra, in keeping with the wisdom of your God which you possess, appoint judges and court officials who can arbitrate cases on behalf of all the people who are in Trans-Euphrates who know the laws of your God. Those who do not know this law should be taught.
12200	15	7	26	Everyone who does not observe both the law of your God and the law of the king will be completely liable to the appropriate penalty, whether it is death or banishment or confiscation of property or detainment in prison.”
12201	15	7	27	¶Blessed be the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of our fathers, who so moved in the heart of the king to so honor the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> which is in Jerusalem!
12202	15	7	28	He has also conferred his favor on me before the king, his advisers, and all the influential leaders of the king. I gained strength as the hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God was on me, and I gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me.
12203	15	8	1	¶These are the leaders and those enrolled with them by genealogy who were coming up with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
12204	15	8	2	¶from the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom; ¶from the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; ¶from the descendants of David, Hattush
12205	15	8	3	the son of Shecaniah; ¶from the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were enrolled by genealogy 150 men;
12206	15	8	4	¶from the descendants of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men;
12207	15	8	5	¶from the descendants of Zattu, Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 men;
12208	15	8	6	¶from the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men;
12209	15	8	7	¶from the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men;
12210	15	8	8	¶from the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him 80 men;
12211	15	8	9	¶from the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men;
12212	15	8	10	¶from the descendants of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men;
12213	15	8	11	¶from the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28 men;
12214	15	8	12	¶from the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men;
12215	15	8	13	¶from the descendants of Adonikam there were the latter ones. Their names were Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men;
12216	15	8	14	¶from the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai, and Zaccur, and with them 70 men.
12217	15	8	15	¶I had them assemble at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there for three days. I observed that the people and the priests were present, but I found no Levites there.
12218	15	8	16	So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were teachers.
12219	15	8	17	I sent them to Iddo, who was the leader in the place called Casiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his relatives, who were the temple servants in Casiphia, so they would bring us attendants for the temple of our God.
12220	15	8	18	¶Due to the fact that the good hand of our God was on us, they brought us a skilled man, from the descendants of Mahli the son of Levi son of Israel. This man was Sherebiah, who was accompanied by his sons and brothers, 18 men,
12221	15	8	19	and Hashabiah, along with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men,
12222	15	8	20	and some of the temple servants that David and his officials had established for the work of the Levites – 220 of them. They were all designated by name.
12223	15	8	21	¶I called for a fast there by the Ahava Canal, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and seek from him a safe journey for us, our children, and all our property.
12224	15	8	22	I was embarrassed to request soldiers and horsemen from the king to protect us from the enemy along the way, because we had said to the king, “The good hand of our God is on everyone who is seeking him, but his great anger is against everyone who forsakes him.”
12225	15	8	23	So we fasted and prayed to our God about this, and he answered us.
12226	15	8	24	¶Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers,
12227	15	8	25	and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the vessels intended for the temple of our God – items that the king, his advisers, his officials, and all Israel who were present had contributed.
12228	15	8	26	I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver vessels worth 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,
12229	15	8	27	20 gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and two exquisite vessels of gleaming bronze, as valuable as gold.
12230	15	8	28	Then I said to them, “You are holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, just as these vessels are holy. The silver and the gold are a voluntary offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of your fathers.
12231	15	8	29	Be careful with them and protect them, until you weigh them out before the leading priests and the Levites and the family leaders of Israel in Jerusalem, in the storerooms of the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
12232	15	8	30	¶Then the priests and the Levites took charge of the silver, the gold, and the vessels that had been weighed out, to transport them to Jerusalem to the temple of our God.
12233	15	8	31	¶On the twelfth day of the first month we began traveling from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from our enemy and from bandits along the way.
12234	15	8	32	So we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there for three days.
12235	15	8	33	On the fourth day we weighed out the silver, the gold, and the vessels in the house of our God into the care of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest, and Eleazar son of Phinehas, who were accompanied by Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui, who were Levites.
12236	15	8	34	Everything was verified by number and by weight, and the total weight was written down at that time.
12237	15	8	35	¶The exiles who were returning from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel – twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs, along with twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
12238	15	8	36	Then they presented the decrees of the king to the king’s satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who gave help to the people and to the temple of God.
12239	15	9	1	¶Now when these things had been completed, the leaders approached me and said, “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the local residents who practice detestable things similar to those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
12240	15	9	2	Indeed, they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race has become intermingled with the local residents. Worse still, the leaders and the officials have been at the forefront of all of this unfaithfulness!”
12241	15	9	3	¶When I heard this report, I tore my tunic and my robe and ripped out some of the hair from my head and beard. Then I sat down, quite devastated.
12242	15	9	4	Everyone who held the words of the God of Israel in awe gathered around me because of the unfaithful acts of the people of the exile. Devastated, I continued to sit there until the evening offering.
12243	15	9	5	¶At the time of the evening offering I got up from my self-abasement, with my tunic and robe torn, and then dropped to my knees and spread my hands to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God.
12244	15	9	6	I prayed, ¶“O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face to you, my God! For our iniquities have climbed higher than our heads, and our guilt extends to the heavens.
12245	15	9	7	From the days of our fathers until this very day our guilt has been great. Because of our iniquities we, along with our kings and priests, have been delivered over by the local kings to sword, captivity, plunder, and embarrassment – right up to the present time.
12246	15	9	8	¶“But now briefly we have received mercy from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, in that he has left us a remnant and has given us a secure position in his holy place. Thus our God has enlightened our eyes and has given us a little relief in our time of servitude.
12247	15	9	9	Although we are slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our servitude. He has extended kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, in that he has revived us to restore the temple of our God and to raise up its ruins and to give us a protective wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
12248	15	9	10	¶“And now what are we able to say after this, our God? For we have forsaken your commandments
12249	15	9	11	which you commanded us through your servants the prophets with these words: ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land defiled by the impurities of the local residents! With their abominations they have filled it from one end to the other with their filthiness.
12250	15	9	12	Therefore do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons, and do not take their daughters in marriage for your sons. Do not ever seek their peace or welfare, so that you may be strong and may eat the good of the land and may leave it as an inheritance for your children forever.’
12251	15	9	13	¶“Everything that has happened to us has come about because of our wicked actions and our great guilt. Even so, our God, you have exercised restraint toward our iniquities and have given us a remnant such as this.
12252	15	9	14	Shall we once again break your commandments and intermarry with these abominable peoples? Would you not be so angered by us that you would wipe us out, with no survivor or remnant?
12253	15	9	15	O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, you are righteous, for we are left as a remnant this day. Indeed, we stand before you in our guilt. However, because of this guilt no one can really stand before you.”
12254	15	10	1	¶While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself to the ground before the temple of God, a very large crowd of Israelites – men, women, and children alike – gathered around him. The people wept loudly.
12255	15	10	2	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, from the descendants of Elam, addressed Ezra: ¶“We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the local peoples. Nonetheless, there is still hope for Israel in this regard.
12256	15	10	3	Therefore let us enact a covenant with our God to send away all these women and their offspring, in keeping with your counsel, my lord, and that of those who respect the commandments of our God. And let it be done according to the law.
12257	15	10	4	Get up, for this matter concerns you. We are with you, so be strong and act decisively!”
12258	15	10	5	¶So Ezra got up and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take an oath to carry out this plan. And they all took a solemn oath.
12259	15	10	6	Then Ezra got up from in front of the temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he stayed there, he did not eat food or drink water, for he was in mourning over the infidelity of the exiles.
12260	15	10	7	¶A proclamation was circulated throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles were to be assembled in Jerusalem.
12261	15	10	8	Everyone who did not come within three days would thereby forfeit all his property, in keeping with the counsel of the officials and the elders. Furthermore, he himself would be excluded from the assembly of the exiles.
12262	15	10	9	¶All the men of Judah and Benjamin were gathered in Jerusalem within the three days. (It was in the ninth month, on the twentieth day of that month.) All the people sat in the square at the temple of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the rains.
12263	15	10	10	¶Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have behaved in an unfaithful manner by taking foreign wives! This has contributed to the guilt of Israel.
12264	15	10	11	Now give praise to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the local residents and from these foreign wives.”
12265	15	10	12	¶All the assembly replied in a loud voice: “We will do just as you have said!
12266	15	10	13	However, the people are numerous and it is the rainy season. We are unable to stand here outside. Furthermore, this business cannot be resolved in a day or two, for we have sinned greatly in this matter.
12267	15	10	14	Let our leaders take steps on behalf of all the assembly. Let all those in our towns who have married foreign women come at an appointed time, and with them the elders of each town and its judges, until the hot anger of our God is turned away from us in this matter.”
12268	15	10	15	¶Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah were against this, assisted by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite.
12269	15	10	16	So the exiles proceeded accordingly. Ezra the priest separated out by name men who were leaders in their family groups. They sat down to consider this matter on the first day of the tenth month,
12270	15	10	17	and on the first day of the first month they finished considering all the men who had married foreign wives.
12271	15	10	18	¶It was determined that from the descendants of the priests, the following had taken foreign wives: from the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
12272	15	10	19	(They gave their word to send away their wives; their guilt offering was a ram from the flock for their guilt.)
12273	15	10	20	¶From the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
12274	15	10	21	¶From the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.
12275	15	10	22	¶From the descendants of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
12276	15	10	23	¶From the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (also known as Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
12277	15	10	24	¶From the singers: Eliashib. From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
12278	15	10	25	¶From the Israelites: from the descendants of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malkijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malkijah, and Benaiah.
12279	15	10	26	¶From the descendants of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah.
12280	15	10	27	¶From the descendants of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza.
12281	15	10	28	¶From the descendants of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
12282	15	10	29	¶From the descendants of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth.
12283	15	10	30	¶From the descendants of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Kelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh.
12284	15	10	31	¶From the descendants of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah, Malkijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
12285	15	10	32	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
12286	15	10	33	¶From the descendants of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
12287	15	10	34	¶From the descendants of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,
12288	15	10	35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Keluhi,
12289	15	10	36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
12290	15	10	37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu.
12291	15	10	38	¶From the descendants of Binnui: Shimei,
12292	15	10	39	Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,
12293	15	10	40	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
12294	15	10	41	Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
12295	15	10	42	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.
12296	15	10	43	¶From the descendants of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.
12297	15	10	44	¶All these had taken foreign wives, and some of them also had children by these women.
12298	16	1	1	¶These are the words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:¶It so happened that in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year, I was in Susa the citadel.
12299	16	1	2	Hanani, who was one of my relatives, along with some of the men from Judah, came to me, and I asked them about the Jews who had escaped and had survived the exile, and about Jerusalem.
12300	16	1	3	¶They said to me, “The remnant that remains from the exile there in the province are experiencing considerable adversity and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem lies breached, and its gates have been burned down!”
12301	16	1	4	¶When I heard these things I sat down abruptly, crying and mourning for several days. I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
12302	16	1	5	Then I said, “Please, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of heaven, great and awesome God, who keeps his loving covenant with those who love him and obey his commandments,
12303	16	1	6	may your ear be attentive and your eyes be open to hear the prayer of your servant that I am praying to you today throughout both day and night on behalf of your servants the Israelites. I am confessing the sins of the Israelites that we have committed against you – both I myself and my family have sinned.
12304	16	1	7	We have behaved corruptly against you, not obeying the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments that you commanded your servant Moses.
12305	16	1	8	Please recall the word you commanded your servant Moses: ‘If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the nations.
12306	16	1	9	But if you repent and obey my commandments and do them, then even if your dispersed people are in the most remote location, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen for my name to reside.’
12307	16	1	10	They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your mighty strength and by your powerful hand.
12308	16	1	11	Please, Lord, listen attentively to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who take pleasure in showing respect to your name. Grant your servant success today and show compassion to me in the presence of this man.” ¶Now I was cupbearer for the king.
12309	16	2	1	¶Then in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought to me, I took the wine and gave it to the king. Previously I had not been depressed in the king’s presence.
12310	16	2	2	So the king said to me, “Why do you appear to be depressed when you aren’t sick? What can this be other than sadness of heart?” This made me very fearful.
12311	16	2	3	¶I replied to the king, “O king, live forever! Why would I not appear dejected when the city with the graves of my ancestors lies desolate and its gates destroyed by fire?”
12312	16	2	4	The king responded, “What is it you are seeking?” Then I quickly prayed to the God of heaven
12313	16	2	5	and said to the king, “If the king is so inclined and if your servant has found favor in your sight, dispatch me to Judah, to the city with the graves of my ancestors, so that I can rebuild it.”
12314	16	2	6	Then the king, with his consort sitting beside him, replied, “How long would your trip take, and when would you return?” Since the king was pleased to send me, I gave him a time.
12315	16	2	7	I said to the king, “If the king is so inclined, let him give me letters for the governors of Trans-Euphrates that will enable me to travel safely until I reach Judah,
12316	16	2	8	and a letter for Asaph the keeper of the king’s nature preserve, so that he will give me timber for beams for the gates of the fortress adjacent to the temple and for the city wall and for the house to which I go.” So the king granted me these requests, for the good hand of my God was on me.
12317	16	2	9	Then I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, and I presented to them the letters from the king. The king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.
12318	16	2	10	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard all this, they were very displeased that someone had come to seek benefit for the Israelites.
12319	16	2	11	¶So I came to Jerusalem. When I had been there for three days,
12320	16	2	12	I got up during the night, along with a few men who were with me. But I did not tell anyone what my God was putting on my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me, except for the one I was riding.
12321	16	2	13	I proceeded through the Valley Gate by night, in the direction of the Well of the Dragons and the Dung Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that had been breached and its gates that had been destroyed by fire.
12322	16	2	14	I passed on to the Gate of the Well and the King’s Pool, where there was not enough room for my animal to pass with me.
12323	16	2	15	I continued up the valley during the night, inspecting the wall. Then I turned back and came to the Valley Gate, and so returned.
12324	16	2	16	The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had been doing, for up to this point I had not told any of the Jews or the priests or the nobles or the officials or the rest of the workers.
12325	16	2	17	Then I said to them, “You see the problem that we have: Jerusalem is desolate and its gates are burned. Come on! Let’s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that this reproach will not continue.”
12326	16	2	18	Then I related to them how the good hand of my God was on me and what the king had said to me. Then they replied, “Let’s begin rebuilding right away!” So they readied themselves for this good project.
12327	16	2	19	But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard all this, they derided us and expressed contempt toward us. They said, “What is this you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”
12328	16	2	20	I responded to them by saying, “The God of heaven will prosper us. We his servants will start the rebuilding. But you have no just or ancient right in Jerusalem.”
12329	16	3	1	¶Then Eliashib the high priest and his priestly colleagues arose and built the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and erected its doors, working as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel.
12330	16	3	2	The men of Jericho built adjacent to it, and Zaccur son of Imri built adjacent to them.
12331	16	3	3	¶The sons of Hassenaah rebuilt the Fish Gate. They laid its beams and positioned its doors, its bolts, and its bars.
12332	16	3	4	Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakoz, worked on the section adjacent to them. Meshullam son of Berechiah the son of Meshezabel worked on the section next to them. And Zadok son of Baana worked on the section adjacent to them.
12333	16	3	5	The men of Tekoa worked on the section adjacent to them, but their town leaders would not assist with the work of their master.
12334	16	3	6	¶Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah worked on the Jeshanah Gate. They laid its beams and positioned its doors, its bolts, and its bars.
12335	16	3	7	Adjacent to them worked Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, who were men of Gibeon and Mizpah. These towns were under the jurisdiction of the governor of Trans-Euphrates.
12336	16	3	8	Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a member of the goldsmiths’ guild, worked on the section adjacent to him. Hananiah, a member of the perfumers’ guild, worked on the section adjacent to him. They plastered the city wall of Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.
12337	16	3	9	Rephaiah son of Hur, head of a half-district of Jerusalem, worked on the section adjacent to them.
12338	16	3	10	Jedaiah son of Harumaph worked on the section adjacent to them opposite his house, and Hattush son of Hashabneiah worked on the section adjacent to him.
12339	16	3	11	Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab worked on another section and the Tower of the Fire Pots.
12340	16	3	12	Shallum son of Hallohesh, head of a half-district of Jerusalem, worked on the section adjacent to him, assisted by his daughters.
12341	16	3	13	¶Hanun and the residents of Zanoah worked on the Valley Gate. They rebuilt it and positioned its doors, its bolts, and its bars, in addition to working on fifteen hundred feet of the wall as far as the Dung Gate.
12342	16	3	14	¶Malkijah son of Recab, head of the district of Beth Hakkerem, worked on the Dung Gate. He rebuilt it and positioned its doors, its bolts, and its bars.
12343	16	3	15	¶Shallun son of Col-Hozeh, head of the district of Mizpah, worked on the Fountain Gate. He rebuilt it, put on its roof, and positioned its doors, its bolts, and its bars. In addition, he rebuilt the wall of the Pool of Siloam, by the royal garden, as far as the steps that go down from the City of David.
12344	16	3	16	Nehemiah son of Azbuk, head of a half-district of Beth Zur, worked after him as far as the tombs of David and the artificial pool and the House of the Warriors.
12345	16	3	17	¶After him the Levites worked – Rehum son of Bani and after him Hashabiah, head of half the district of Keilah, for his district.
12346	16	3	18	After him their relatives worked – Binnui son of Henadad, head of a half-district of Keilah.
12347	16	3	19	Adjacent to him Ezer son of Jeshua, head of Mizpah, worked on another section, opposite the ascent to the armory at the buttress.
12348	16	3	20	After him Baruch son of Zabbai worked on another section, from the buttress to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
12349	16	3	21	After him Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, worked on another section from the door of Eliashib’s house to the end of it.
12350	16	3	22	¶After him the priests worked, men of the nearby district.
12351	16	3	23	After them Benjamin and Hasshub worked opposite their house. After them Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, worked near his house.
12352	16	3	24	After him Binnui son of Henadad worked on another section, from the house of Azariah to the buttress and the corner.
12353	16	3	25	After him Palal son of Uzai worked opposite the buttress and the tower that protrudes from the upper palace of the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah son of Parosh
12354	16	3	26	and the temple servants who were living on Ophel worked up to the area opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the protruding tower.
12355	16	3	27	After them the men of Tekoa worked on another section, from opposite the great protruding tower to the wall of Ophel.
12356	16	3	28	¶Above the Horse Gate the priests worked, each in front of his house.
12357	16	3	29	After them Zadok son of Immer worked opposite his house, and after him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, guard at the East Gate, worked.
12358	16	3	30	After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, worked on another section. After them Meshullam son of Berechiah worked opposite his quarters.
12359	16	3	31	After him Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, worked as far as the house of the temple servants and the traders, opposite the Inspection Gate, and up to the room above the corner.
12360	16	3	32	And between the room above the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and traders worked.
12361	16	4	1	¶(3:33) Now when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall he became angry and was quite upset. He derided the Jews,
12362	16	4	2	and in the presence of his colleagues and the army of Samaria he said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they be left to themselves? Will they again offer sacrifice? Will they finish this in a day? Can they bring these burnt stones to life again from piles of dust?”
12363	16	4	3	¶Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was close by, said, “If even a fox were to climb up on what they are building, it would break down their wall of stones!”
12364	16	4	4	¶Hear, O our God, for we are despised! Return their reproach on their own head! Reduce them to plunder in a land of exile!
12365	16	4	5	Do not cover their iniquity, and do not wipe out their sin from your sight. For they have bitterly offended the builders!
12366	16	4	6	¶So we rebuilt the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height. The people were enthusiastic in their work.
12367	16	4	7	¶(4:1) When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people of Ashdod heard that the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem had moved ahead and that the breaches had begun to be closed, they were very angry.
12368	16	4	8	All of them conspired together to move with armed forces against Jerusalem and to create a disturbance in it.
12369	16	4	9	So we prayed to our God and stationed a guard to protect against them both day and night.
12370	16	4	10	Then those in Judah said, “The strength of the laborers has failed! The debris is so great that we are unable to rebuild the wall.”
12371	16	4	11	¶Our adversaries also boasted, “Before they are aware or anticipate anything, we will come in among them and kill them, and we will bring this work to a halt!”
12372	16	4	12	¶So it happened that the Jews who were living near them came and warned us repeatedly about all the schemes they were plotting against us.
12373	16	4	13	¶So I stationed people at the lower places behind the wall in the exposed places. I stationed the people by families, with their swords, spears, and bows.
12374	16	4	14	When I had made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the great and awesome Lord, and fight on behalf of your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your families!”
12375	16	4	15	¶It so happened that when our adversaries heard that we were aware of these matters, God frustrated their intentions. Then all of us returned to the wall, each to his own work.
12376	16	4	16	From that day forward, half of my men were doing the work and half of them were taking up spears, shields, bows, and body armor. Now the officers were behind all the people of Judah
12377	16	4	17	who were rebuilding the wall. Those who were carrying loads did so by keeping one hand on the work and the other on their weapon.
12378	16	4	18	The builders to a man had their swords strapped to their sides while they were building. But the trumpeter remained with me.
12379	16	4	19	¶I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “The work is demanding and extensive, and we are spread out on the wall, far removed from one another.
12380	16	4	20	Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, gather there with us. Our God will fight for us!”
12381	16	4	21	¶So we worked on, with half holding spears, from dawn till dusk.
12382	16	4	22	At that time I instructed the people, “Let every man and his coworker spend the night in Jerusalem and let them be guards for us by night and workers by day.”
12383	16	4	23	We did not change clothes – not I, nor my relatives, nor my workers, nor the watchmen who were with me. Each had his weapon, even when getting a drink of water.
12384	16	5	1	¶Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews.
12385	16	5	2	There were those who said, “With our sons and daughters, we are many. We must obtain grain in order to eat and stay alive.”
12386	16	5	3	There were others who said, “We are putting up our fields, our vineyards, and our houses as collateral in order to obtain grain during the famine.”
12387	16	5	4	Then there were those who said, “We have borrowed money to pay our taxes to the king on our fields and our vineyards.
12388	16	5	5	And now, though we share the same flesh and blood as our fellow countrymen, and our children are just like their children, still we have found it necessary to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have been subjected to slavery, while we are powerless to help, since our fields and vineyards now belong to other people.”
12389	16	5	6	¶I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints.
12390	16	5	7	I considered these things carefully and then registered a complaint with the wealthy and the officials. I said to them, “Each one of you is seizing the collateral from your own countrymen!” Because of them I called for a great public assembly.
12391	16	5	8	I said to them, “To the extent possible we have bought back our fellow Jews who had been sold to the Gentiles. But now you yourselves want to sell your own countrymen, so that we can then buy them back!” They were utterly silent, and could find nothing to say.
12392	16	5	9	¶Then I said, “The thing that you are doing is wrong! Should you not conduct yourselves in the fear of our God in order to avoid the reproach of the Gentiles who are our enemies?
12393	16	5	10	Even I and my relatives and my associates are lending them money and grain. But let us abandon this practice of seizing collateral!
12394	16	5	11	This very day return to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive trees, and their houses, along with the interest that you are exacting from them on the money, the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil.”
12395	16	5	12	¶They replied, “We will return these things, and we will no longer demand anything from them. We will do just as you say.” Then I called the priests and made the wealthy and the officials swear to do what had been promised.
12396	16	5	13	I also shook out my garment, and I said, “In this way may God shake out from his house and his property every person who does not carry out this matter. In this way may he be shaken out and emptied!” All the assembly replied, “So be it!” and they praised the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Then the people did as they had promised.
12397	16	5	14	¶From the day that I was appointed governor in the land of Judah, that is, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes – twelve years in all – neither I nor my relatives ate the food allotted to the governor.
12398	16	5	15	But the former governors who preceded me had burdened the people and had taken food and wine from them, in addition to forty shekels of silver. Their associates were also domineering over the people. But I did not behave in this way, due to my fear of God.
12399	16	5	16	I gave myself to the work on this wall, without even purchasing a field. All my associates were gathered there for the work.
12400	16	5	17	¶There were 150 Jews and officials who dined with me routinely, in addition to those who came to us from the nations all around us.
12401	16	5	18	Every day one ox, six select sheep, and some birds were prepared for me, and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance. Despite all this I did not require the food allotted to the governor, for the work was demanding on this people.
12402	16	5	19	¶Please remember me for good, O my God, for all that I have done for this people.
12403	16	6	1	¶When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and no breach remained in it (even though up to that time I had not positioned doors in the gates),
12404	16	6	2	Sanballat and Geshem sent word to me saying, “Come on! Let’s set up a time to meet together at Kephirim in the plain of Ono.” Now they intended to do me harm.
12405	16	6	3	¶So I sent messengers to them saying, “I am engaged in an important work, and I am unable to come down. Why should the work come to a halt when I leave it to come down to you?”
12406	16	6	4	They contacted me four times in this way, and I responded the same way each time.
12407	16	6	5	¶The fifth time that Sanballat sent his assistant to me in this way, he had an open letter in his hand.
12408	16	6	6	Written in it were the following words: ¶“Among the nations it is rumored (and Geshem has substantiated this) that you and the Jews have intentions of revolting, and for this reason you are building the wall. Furthermore, according to these rumors you are going to become their king.
12409	16	6	7	You have also established prophets to announce in Jerusalem on your behalf, ‘We have a king in Judah!’ Now the king is going to hear about these rumors. So come on! Let’s talk about this.”
12410	16	6	8	¶I sent word back to him, “We are not engaged in these activities you are describing. All of this is a figment of your imagination.”
12411	16	6	9	¶All of them were wanting to scare us, supposing, “Their hands will grow slack from the work, and it won’t get done.” ¶So now, strengthen my hands!
12412	16	6	10	¶Then I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel. He was confined to his home. He said, “Let’s set up a time to meet in the house of God, within the temple. Let’s close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. It will surely be at night that they will come to kill you.”
12413	16	6	11	¶But I replied, “Should a man like me run away? Would someone like me flee to the temple in order to save his life? I will not go!”
12414	16	6	12	I recognized the fact that God had not sent him, for he had spoken the prophecy against me as a hired agent of Tobiah and Sanballat.
12415	16	6	13	He had been hired to scare me so that I would do this and thereby sin. They would thus bring reproach on me and I would be discredited.
12416	16	6	14	¶Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat in light of these actions of theirs – also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who were trying to scare me!
12417	16	6	15	¶So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in just fifty-two days.
12418	16	6	16	When all our enemies heard and all the nations who were around us saw this, they were greatly disheartened. They knew that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.
12419	16	6	17	¶In those days the aristocrats of Judah repeatedly sent letters to Tobiah, and responses from Tobiah were repeatedly coming to them.
12420	16	6	18	For many in Judah had sworn allegiance to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jonathan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.
12421	16	6	19	They were telling me about his good deeds and then taking back to him the things I said. Tobiah, on the other hand, sent letters in order to scare me.
12422	16	7	1	¶When the wall had been rebuilt and I had positioned the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed,
12423	16	7	2	I then put in charge over Jerusalem my brother Hanani and Hananiah the chief of the citadel, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many do.
12424	16	7	3	I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened in the early morning, until those who are standing guard close the doors and lock them. Position residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their guard stations and some near their homes.”
12425	16	7	4	Now the city was spread out and large, and there were not a lot of people in it. At that time houses had not been rebuilt.
12426	16	7	5	My God placed it on my heart to gather the leaders, the officials, and the ordinary people so they could be enrolled on the basis of genealogy. I found the genealogical records of those who had formerly returned. Here is what I found written in that record:
12427	16	7	6	¶These are the people of the province who returned from the captivity of the exiles, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had forced into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his own city.
12428	16	7	7	They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.¶The number of Israelite men was as follows:
12429	16	7	8	¶the descendants of Parosh, 2,172;
12430	16	7	9	¶the descendants of Shephatiah, 372;
12431	16	7	10	¶the descendants of Arah, 652;

12440	16	7	19	¶the descendants of Bigvai, 2,067;
12441	16	7	20	¶the descendants of Adin, 655;
12442	16	7	21	¶the descendants of Ater (through Hezekiah), 98;
12443	16	7	22	¶the descendants of Hashum, 328;
12444	16	7	23	¶the descendants of Bezai, 324;
12445	16	7	24	¶the descendants of Harif, 112;
12446	16	7	25	¶the descendants of Gibeon, 95;
12447	16	7	26	¶The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, 188;
12448	16	7	27	¶the men of Anathoth, 128;
12449	16	7	28	¶the men of the family of Azmaveth, 42;
12450	16	7	29	¶the men of Kiriath Jearim, Kephirah, and Beeroth, 743;
12451	16	7	30	¶the men of Ramah and Geba, 621;
12452	16	7	31	¶the men of Micmash, 122;
12453	16	7	32	¶the men of Bethel and Ai, 123;
12454	16	7	33	¶the men of the other Nebo, 52;
12455	16	7	34	¶the descendants of the other Elam, 1,254;
12456	16	7	35	¶the descendants of Harim, 320;
12457	16	7	36	¶the descendants of Jericho, 345;
12458	16	7	37	¶the descendants of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, 721;
12459	16	7	38	¶the descendants of Senaah, 3,930;
12460	16	7	39	¶The priests: ¶the descendants of Jedaiah (through the family of Jeshua), 973;
12461	16	7	40	¶the descendants of Immer, 1,052;
12462	16	7	41	¶the descendants of Pashhur, 1,247;
12463	16	7	42	¶the descendants of Harim, 1,017.
12464	16	7	43	¶The Levites: ¶the descendants of Jeshua (through Kadmiel, through the line of Hodaviah), 74.
12465	16	7	44	¶The singers: ¶the descendants of Asaph, 148.
12466	16	7	45	¶The gatekeepers: ¶the descendants of Shallum, the descendants of Ater, the descendants of Talmon, the descendants of Akkub, the descendants of Hatita, and the descendants of Shobai, 138.
12467	16	7	46	¶The temple servants: ¶the descendants of Ziha, the descendants of Hasupha, the descendants of Tabbaoth,
12468	16	7	47	the descendants of Keros, the descendants of Sia, the descendants of Padon,
12469	16	7	48	the descendants of Lebanah, the descendants of Hagabah, the descendants of Shalmai,
12470	16	7	49	the descendants of Hanan, the descendants of Giddel, the descendants of Gahar,
12471	16	7	50	the descendants of Reaiah, the descendants of Rezin, the descendants of Nekoda,
12472	16	7	51	the descendants of Gazzam, the descendants of Uzzah, the descendants of Paseah,
12473	16	7	52	the descendants of Besai, the descendants of Meunim, the descendants of Nephussim,
12474	16	7	53	the descendants of Bakbuk, the descendants of Hakupha, the descendants of Harhur,
12475	16	7	54	the descendants of Bazluth, the descendants of Mehida, the descendants of Harsha,
12476	16	7	55	the descendants of Barkos, the descendants of Sisera, the descendants of Temah,
12477	16	7	56	the descendants of Neziah, the descendants of Hatipha.
12478	16	7	57	¶The descendants of the servants of Solomon: ¶the descendants of Sotai, the descendants of Sophereth, the descendants of Perida,
12479	16	7	58	the descendants of Jaala, the descendants of Darkon, the descendants of Giddel,
12480	16	7	59	the descendants of Shephatiah, the descendants of Hattil, the descendants of Pokereth-Hazzebaim, and the descendants of Amon.
12481	16	7	60	¶All the temple servants and the descendants of the servants of Solomon, 392.
12482	16	7	61	¶These are the ones who came up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon, and Immer (although they were unable to certify their family connection or their ancestry, as to whether they were really from Israel):
12483	16	7	62	¶the descendants of Delaiah, the descendants of Tobiah, and the descendants of Nekoda, 642.
12484	16	7	63	¶And from among the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, and the descendants of Barzillai (who had married a woman from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by that name).
12485	16	7	64	They searched for their records in the genealogical materials, but none were found. They were therefore excluded from the priesthood.
12486	16	7	65	The governor instructed them not to eat any of the sacred food until there was a priest who could consult the Urim and Thummim.
12487	16	7	66	¶The entire group numbered 42,360.
12488	16	7	67	not counting their 7,337 male and female servants. They also had 245 male and female singers.
12489	16	7	68	They had 736 horses, 245 mules,
12490	16	7	69	(7:68) 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
12491	16	7	70	Some of the family leaders contributed to the work. The governor contributed to the treasury 1,000 gold drachmas, 50 bowls, and 530 priestly garments.
12492	16	7	71	Some of the family leaders gave to the project treasury 20,000 gold drachmas and 2,200 silver minas.
12493	16	7	72	What the rest of the people gave amounted to 20,000 gold drachmas, 2,000 silver minas, and 67 priestly garments.
12494	16	7	73	¶The priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all the rest of Israel lived in their cities.
12495	16	8	1	¶When the seventh month arrived and the Israelites were settled in their cities, all the people gathered together in the plaza which was in front of the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded Israel.
12496	16	8	2	So Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly which included men and women and all those able to understand what they heard. (This happened on the first day of the seventh month.)
12497	16	8	3	So he read it before the plaza in front of the Water Gate from dawn till noon before the men and women and those children who could understand. All the people were eager to hear the book of the law.
12498	16	8	4	¶Ezra the scribe stood on a towering wooden platform constructed for this purpose. Standing near him on his right were Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Masseiah. On his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
12499	16	8	5	Ezra opened the book in plain view of all the people, for he was elevated above all the people. When he opened the book, all the people stood up.
12500	16	8	6	Ezra blessed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the great God, and all the people replied “Amen! Amen!” as they lifted their hands. Then they bowed down and worshiped the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with their faces to the ground.
12501	16	8	7	¶Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah – all of whom were Levites – were teaching the people the law, as the people remained standing.
12502	16	8	8	They read from the book of God’s law, explaining it and imparting insight. Thus the people gained understanding from what was read.
12503	16	8	9	¶Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priestly scribe, and the Levites who were imparting understanding to the people said to all of them, “This day is holy to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. Do not mourn or weep.” For all the people had been weeping when they heard the words of the law.
12504	16	8	10	He said to them, “Go and eat delicacies and drink sweet drinks and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared. For this day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is your strength.”
12505	16	8	11	¶Then the Levites quieted all the people saying, “Be quiet, for this day is holy. Do not grieve.”
12506	16	8	12	So all the people departed to eat and drink and to share their food with others and to enjoy tremendous joy, for they had gained insight in the matters that had been made known to them.
12507	16	8	13	¶On the second day of the month the family leaders met with Ezra the scribe, together with all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to consider the words of the law.
12508	16	8	14	They discovered written in the law that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded through Moses that the Israelites should live in temporary shelters during the festival of the seventh month,
12509	16	8	15	and that they should make a proclamation and disseminate this message in all their cities and in Jerusalem: “Go to the hill country and bring back olive branches and branches of wild olive trees, myrtle trees, date palms, and other leafy trees to construct temporary shelters, as it is written.”
12510	16	8	16	¶So the people went out and brought these things back and constructed temporary shelters for themselves, each on his roof and in his courtyard and in the courtyards of the temple of God and in the plaza of the Water Gate and the plaza of the Ephraim Gate.
12511	16	8	17	So all the assembly which had returned from the exile constructed temporary shelters and lived in them. The Israelites had not done so from the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day. Everyone experienced very great joy.
12512	16	8	18	Ezra read in the book of the law of God day by day, from the first day to the last. They observed the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day they held an assembly as was required.
12513	16	9	1	¶On the twenty-fourth day of this same month the Israelites assembled; they were fasting and wearing sackcloth, their heads covered with dust.
12514	16	9	2	Those truly of Israelite descent separated from all the foreigners, standing and confessing their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors.
12515	16	9	3	For one-fourth of the day they stood in their place and read from the book of the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God, and for another fourth they were confessing their sins and worshiping the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God.
12516	16	9	4	Then the Levites – Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani – stood on the steps and called out loudly to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God.
12517	16	9	5	The Levites – Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah – said, “Stand up and bless the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God!”¶“May you be blessed, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, from age to age. May your glorious name be blessed; may it be lifted up above all blessing and praise.
12518	16	9	6	You alone are the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, along with all their multitude of stars, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You impart life to them all, and the multitudes of heaven worship you.
12519	16	9	7	¶“You are the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God who chose Abram and brought him forth from Ur of the Chaldeans. You changed his name to Abraham.
12520	16	9	8	When you perceived that his heart was faithful toward you, you established a covenant with him to give his descendants the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites. You have fulfilled your promise, for you are righteous.
12521	16	9	9	¶“You saw the affliction of our ancestors in Egypt, and you heard their cry at the Red Sea.
12522	16	9	10	You performed awesome signs against Pharaoh, against his servants, and against all the people of his land, for you knew that the Egyptians had acted presumptuously against them. You made for yourself a name that is celebrated to this day.
12523	16	9	11	You split the sea before them, and they crossed through the sea on dry ground! But you threw their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into surging waters.
12524	16	9	12	You guided them with a pillar of cloud by day and with a pillar of fire by night to illumine for them the path they were to travel.
12525	16	9	13	¶“You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven. You provided them with just judgments, true laws, and good statutes and commandments.
12526	16	9	14	You made known to them your holy Sabbath; you issued commandments, statutes, and law to them through Moses your servant.
12527	16	9	15	You provided bread from heaven for them in their time of hunger, and you brought forth water from the rock for them in their time of thirst. You told them to enter in order to possess the land that you had sworn to give them.
12528	16	9	16	¶“But they – our ancestors – behaved presumptuously; they rebelled and did not obey your commandments.
12529	16	9	17	They refused to obey and did not recall your miracles that you had performed among them. Instead, they rebelled and appointed a leader to return to their bondage in Egypt. But you are a God of forgiveness, merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and unfailing in your loyal love. You did not abandon them,
12530	16	9	18	even when they made a cast image of a calf for themselves and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up from Egypt,’ or when they committed atrocious blasphemies.
12531	16	9	19	¶“Due to your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud did not stop guiding them in the path by day, nor did the pillar of fire stop illuminating for them by night the path on which they should travel.
12532	16	9	20	You imparted your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths; you provided water for their thirst.
12533	16	9	21	For forty years you sustained them. Even in the wilderness they never lacked anything. Their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.
12534	16	9	22	¶“You gave them kingdoms and peoples, and you allocated them to every corner of the land. They inherited the land of King Sihon of Heshbon and the land of King Og of Bashan.
12535	16	9	23	You multiplied their descendants like the stars of the sky. You brought them to the land you had told their ancestors to enter in order to possess.
12536	16	9	24	Their descendants entered and possessed the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites who were the inhabitants of the land. You delivered them into their hand, together with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with as they pleased.
12537	16	9	25	They captured fortified cities and fertile land. They took possession of houses full of all sorts of good things – wells previously dug, vineyards, olive trees, and fruit trees in abundance. They ate until they were full and grew fat. They enjoyed to the full your great goodness.
12538	16	9	26	¶“Nonetheless they grew disobedient and rebelled against you; they disregarded your law. They killed your prophets who had solemnly admonished them in order to cause them to return to you. They committed atrocious blasphemies.
12539	16	9	27	Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who oppressed them. But in the time of their distress they called to you, and you heard from heaven. In your abundant compassion you provided them with deliverers to rescue them from their adversaries.
12540	16	9	28	¶“Then, when they were at rest again, they went back to doing evil before you. Then you abandoned them to their enemies, and they gained dominion over them. When they again cried out to you, in your compassion you heard from heaven and rescued them time and again.
12541	16	9	29	And you solemnly admonished them in order to return them to your law, but they behaved presumptuously and did not obey your commandments. They sinned against your ordinances – those by which an individual, if he obeys them, will live. They boldly turned from you; they rebelled and did not obey.
12542	16	9	30	You prolonged your kindness with them for many years, and you solemnly admonished them by your Spirit through your prophets. Still they paid no attention, so you delivered them into the hands of the neighboring peoples.
12543	16	9	31	However, due to your abundant mercy you did not do away with them altogether; you did not abandon them. For you are a merciful and compassionate God.
12544	16	9	32	¶“So now, our God – the great, powerful, and awesome God, who keeps covenant fidelity – do not regard as inconsequential all the hardship that has befallen us – our kings, our leaders, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors, and all your people – from the days of the kings of Assyria until this very day!
12545	16	9	33	You are righteous with regard to all that has happened to us, for you have acted faithfully. It is we who have been in the wrong!
12546	16	9	34	Our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our ancestors have not kept your law. They have not paid attention to your commandments or your testimonies by which you have solemnly admonished them.
12547	16	9	35	Even when they were in their kingdom and benefiting from your incredible goodness that you had lavished on them in the spacious and fertile land you had set before them, they did not serve you, nor did they turn from their evil practices.
12548	16	9	36	¶“So today we are slaves! In the very land you gave to our ancestors to eat its fruit and to enjoy its good things – we are slaves!
12549	16	9	37	Its abundant produce goes to the kings you have placed over us due to our sins. They rule over our bodies and our livestock as they see fit, and we are in great distress!
12550	16	9	38	¶(10:1) “Because of all of this we are entering into a binding covenant in written form; our leaders, our Levites, and our priests have affixed their names on the sealed document.”
12551	16	10	1	¶On the sealed documents were the following names: ¶Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah, along with Zedekiah,
12552	16	10	2	¶Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
12553	16	10	3	¶Pashhur, Amariah, Malkijah,
12554	16	10	4	¶Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,
12555	16	10	5	¶Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
12556	16	10	6	¶Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
12557	16	10	7	¶Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
12558	16	10	8	¶Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah. These were the priests.
12559	16	10	9	¶The Levites were as follows: ¶Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel.
12560	16	10	10	¶Their colleagues were as follows: ¶Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
12561	16	10	11	¶Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,
12562	16	10	12	¶Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
12563	16	10	13	¶Hodiah, Bani, and Beninu.
12564	16	10	14	¶The leaders of the people were as follows: ¶Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
12565	16	10	15	¶Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
12566	16	10	16	¶Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
12567	16	10	17	¶Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
12568	16	10	18	¶Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
12569	16	10	19	¶Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
12570	16	10	20	¶Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
12571	16	10	21	¶Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
12572	16	10	22	¶Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
12573	16	10	23	¶Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
12574	16	10	24	¶Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
12575	16	10	25	¶Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
12576	16	10	26	¶Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
12577	16	10	27	¶Malluch, Harim, and Baanah.
12578	16	10	28	¶“Now the rest of the people – the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple attendants, and all those who have separated themselves from the neighboring peoples because of the law of God, along with their wives, their sons, and their daughters, all of whom are able to understand –
12579	16	10	29	hereby participate with their colleagues the town leaders and enter into a curse and an oath to adhere to the law of God which was given through Moses the servant of God, and to obey carefully all the commandments of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our Lord, along with his ordinances and his statutes.
12580	16	10	30	¶“We will not give our daughters in marriage to the neighboring peoples, and we will not take their daughters in marriage for our sons.
12581	16	10	31	We will not buy on the Sabbath or on a holy day from the neighboring peoples who bring their wares and all kinds of grain to sell on the Sabbath day. We will let the fields lie fallow every seventh year, and we will cancel every loan.
12582	16	10	32	We accept responsibility for fulfilling the commands to give one third of a shekel each year for the work of the temple of our God,
12583	16	10	33	for the loaves of presentation and for the regular grain offerings and regular burnt offerings, for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, for the appointed meetings, for the holy offerings, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the temple of our God.
12584	16	10	34	¶“We – the priests, the Levites, and the people – have cast lots concerning the wood offerings, to bring them to the temple of our God according to our families at the designated times year by year to burn on the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, as is written in the law.
12585	16	10	35	We also accept responsibility for bringing the first fruits of our land and the first fruits of every fruit tree year by year to the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
12586	16	10	36	We also accept responsibility, as is written in the law, for bringing the firstborn of our sons and our cattle and the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks to the temple of our God, to the priests who are ministering in the temple of our God.
12587	16	10	37	We will also bring the first of our coarse meal, of our contributions, of the fruit of every tree, of new wine, and of olive oil to the priests at the storerooms of the temple of our God, along with a tenth of the produce of our land to the Levites, for the Levites are the ones who collect the tithes in all the cities where we work.
12588	16	10	38	A priest of Aaron’s line will be with the Levites when the Levites collect the tithes, and the Levites will bring up a tenth of the tithes to the temple of our God, to the storerooms of the treasury.
12589	16	10	39	The Israelites and the Levites will bring the contribution of the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil to the storerooms where the utensils of the sanctuary are kept, and where the priests who minister stay, along with the gatekeepers and the singers. We will not neglect the temple of our God.”
12590	16	11	1	¶So the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem, while the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to settle in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine remained in other cities.
12591	16	11	2	The people gave their blessing on all the men who volunteered to settle in Jerusalem.
12592	16	11	3	¶These are the provincial leaders who settled in Jerusalem. (While other Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple attendants, and the sons of the servants of Solomon settled in the cities of Judah, each on his own property in their cities,
12593	16	11	4	some of the descendants of Judah and some of the descendants of Benjamin settled in Jerusalem.) ¶Of the descendants of Judah: ¶Athaiah son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, from the descendants of Perez;
12594	16	11	5	and Maaseiah son of Baruch, the son of Col-Hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, from the descendants of Shelah.
12595	16	11	6	The sum total of the descendants of Perez who were settling in Jerusalem was 468 exceptional men.
12596	16	11	7	¶These are the descendants of Benjamin: ¶Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah,
12597	16	11	8	and his followers, Gabbai and Sallai – 928 in all.
12598	16	11	9	Joel son of Zicri was the officer in charge of them, and Judah son of Hassenuah was second-in-command over the city.
12599	16	11	10	¶From the priests: ¶Jedaiah son of Joiarib, Jakin,
12600	16	11	11	Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, supervisor in the temple of God,
12601	16	11	12	and their colleagues who were carrying out work for the temple – 822; and Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malkijah,
12602	16	11	13	and his colleagues who were heads of families – 242; and Amashsai son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
12603	16	11	14	and his colleagues who were exceptional men – 128. The officer over them was Zabdiel the son of Haggedolim.
12604	16	11	15	¶From the Levites: ¶Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
12605	16	11	16	Shabbethai and Jozabad, leaders of the Levites, were in charge of the external work for the temple of God;
12606	16	11	17	Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, the praise leader who led in thanksgiving and prayer; Bakbukiah, second among his colleagues; and Abda son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
12607	16	11	18	The sum total of the Levites in the holy city was 284.
12608	16	11	19	¶And the gatekeepers: ¶Akkub, Talmon and their colleagues who were guarding the gates – 172.
12609	16	11	20	¶And the rest of the Israelites, with the priests and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, each on his own property.
12610	16	11	21	¶The temple attendants were living on Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were over them.
12611	16	11	22	¶The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica. He was one of Asaph’s descendants who were the singers responsible for the service of the temple of God.
12612	16	11	23	For they were under royal orders which determined their activity day by day.
12613	16	11	24	¶Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, one of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was an adviser to the king in every matter pertaining to the people.
12614	16	11	25	¶As for the settlements with their fields, some of the people of Judah settled in Kiriath Arba and its neighboring villages, in Dibon and its villages, in Jekabzeel and its settlements,
12615	16	11	26	in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth Pelet,
12616	16	11	27	in Hazar Shual, in Beer Sheba and its villages,
12617	16	11	28	in Ziklag, in Meconah and its villages,
12618	16	11	29	in En Rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth,
12619	16	11	30	Zanoah, Adullam and their settlements, in Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah and its villages. So they were encamped from Beer Sheba to the Valley of Hinnom.
12620	16	11	31	¶Some of the descendants of Benjamin settled in Geba, Micmash, Aija, Bethel and its villages,
12621	16	11	32	in Anathoth, Nob, and Ananiah,
12622	16	11	33	in Hazor, Ramah, and Gittaim,
12623	16	11	34	in Hadid, Zeboim, and Neballat,
12624	16	11	35	in Lod, Ono, and the Valley of the Craftsmen.
12625	16	11	36	Some of the Judean divisions of the Levites settled in Benjamin.
12626	16	12	1	¶These are the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
12627	16	12	2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
12628	16	12	3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
12629	16	12	4	Iddo, Ginnethon, Abijah,
12630	16	12	5	Mijamin, Moadiah, Bilgah,
12631	16	12	6	Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
12632	16	12	7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their colleagues in the days of Jeshua.
12633	16	12	8	¶And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who together with his colleagues was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving.
12634	16	12	9	Bakbukiah and Unni, their colleagues, stood opposite them in the services.
12635	16	12	10	¶Jeshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim was the father of Eliashib, Eliashib was the father of Joiada,
12636	16	12	11	Joiada was the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua.
12637	16	12	12	¶In the days of Joiakim, these were the priests who were leaders of the families: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
12638	16	12	13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
12639	16	12	14	of Malluch, Jonathan; of Shecaniah, Joseph;
12640	16	12	15	of Harim, Adna; of Meremoth, Helkai;
12641	16	12	16	of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
12642	16	12	17	of Abijah, Zicri; of Miniamin and of Moadiah, Piltai;
12643	16	12	18	of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
12644	16	12	19	of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
12645	16	12	20	of Sallu, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
12646	16	12	21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
12647	16	12	22	¶As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua the heads of families were recorded, as were the priests during the reign of Darius the Persian.
12648	16	12	23	The descendants of Levi were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles as heads of families up to the days of Johanan son of Eliashib.
12649	16	12	24	And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their colleagues, who stood opposite them to offer praise and thanks, one contingent corresponding to the other, as specified by David the man of God.
12650	16	12	25	¶Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who were guarding the storerooms at the gates.
12651	16	12	26	These all served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priestly scribe.
12652	16	12	27	¶At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought out the Levites from all the places they lived to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication joyfully with songs of thanksgiving and songs accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres.
12653	16	12	28	The singers were also assembled from the district around Jerusalem and from the settlements of the Netophathites
12654	16	12	29	and from Beth Gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built settlements for themselves around Jerusalem.
12655	16	12	30	When the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
12656	16	12	31	¶I brought the leaders of Judah up on top of the wall, and I appointed two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on the top of the wall southward toward the Dung Gate.
12657	16	12	32	Going after them were Hoshaiah, half the leaders of Judah,
12658	16	12	33	Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
12659	16	12	34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
12660	16	12	35	some of the priests with trumpets, Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
12661	16	12	36	and his colleagues – Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani – with musical instruments of David the man of God. (Ezra the scribe led them.)
12662	16	12	37	They went over the Fountain Gate and continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall. They passed the house of David and continued on to the Water Gate toward the east.
12663	16	12	38	¶The second choir was proceeding in the opposite direction. I followed them, along with half the people, on top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,
12664	16	12	39	over the Ephraim Gate, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate. They stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
12665	16	12	40	¶Then the two choirs that gave thanks took their stations in the temple of God. I did also, along with half the officials with me,
12666	16	12	41	and the priests – Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with their trumpets –
12667	16	12	42	and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. The choirs sang loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah.
12668	16	12	43	And on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced, for God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard from far away.
12669	16	12	44	¶On that day men were appointed over the storerooms for the contributions, first fruits, and tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions prescribed by the law for the priests and the Levites, for the people of Judah took delight in the priests and Levites who were ministering.
12670	16	12	45	They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David and his son Solomon.
12671	16	12	46	For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanks to God.
12672	16	12	47	So in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, all Israel was contributing the portions for the singers and gatekeepers, according to the daily need. They also set aside the portion for the Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.
12673	16	13	1	¶On that day the book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people. They found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite may ever enter the assembly of God,
12674	16	13	2	for they had not met the Israelites with food and water, but instead had hired Balaam to curse them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into blessing.)
12675	16	13	3	When they heard the law, they removed from Israel all who were of mixed ancestry.
12676	16	13	4	¶But prior to this time, Eliashib the priest, a relative of Tobiah, had been appointed over the storerooms of the temple of our God.
12677	16	13	5	He made for himself a large storeroom where previously they had been keeping the grain offering, the incense, and the vessels, along with the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil as commanded for the Levites, the singers, the gate keepers, and the offering for the priests.
12678	16	13	6	¶During all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes of Babylon, I had gone back to the king. After some time I had requested leave of the king,
12679	16	13	7	and I returned to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by supplying him with a storeroom in the courts of the temple of God.
12680	16	13	8	I was very upset, and I threw all of Tobiah’s household possessions out of the storeroom.
12681	16	13	9	Then I gave instructions that the storerooms should be purified, and I brought back the equipment of the temple of God, along with the grain offering and the incense.
12682	16	13	10	¶I also discovered that the portions for the Levites had not been provided, and that as a result the Levites and the singers who performed this work had all gone off to their fields.
12683	16	13	11	So I registered a complaint with the leaders, asking, “Why is the temple of God neglected?” Then I gathered them and reassigned them to their positions.
12684	16	13	12	¶Then all of Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil to the storerooms.
12685	16	13	13	I gave instructions that Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a certain Levite named Pedaiah be put in charge of the storerooms, and that Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, be their assistant, for they were regarded as trustworthy. It was then their responsibility to oversee the distribution to their colleagues.
12686	16	13	14	¶Please remember me for this, O my God, and do not wipe out the kindness that I have done for the temple of my God and for its services!
12687	16	13	15	¶In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps of grain and loading them onto donkeys, along with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads, and bringing them to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them on the day that they sold these provisions.
12688	16	13	16	The people from Tyre who lived there were bringing fish and all kinds of merchandise and were selling it on the Sabbath to the people of Judah – and in Jerusalem, of all places!
12689	16	13	17	So I registered a complaint with the nobles of Judah, saying to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day?
12690	16	13	18	Isn’t this the way your ancestors acted, causing our God to bring on them and on this city all this misfortune? And now you are causing even more wrath on Israel, profaning the Sabbath like this !”
12691	16	13	19	¶When the evening shadows began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be closed. I further directed that they were not to be opened until after the Sabbath. I positioned some of my young men at the gates so that no load could enter on the Sabbath day.
12692	16	13	20	The traders and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice.
12693	16	13	21	But I warned them and said, “Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you repeat this, I will forcibly remove you!” From that time on they did not show up on the Sabbath.
12694	16	13	22	Then I directed the Levites to purify themselves and come and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.¶For this please remember me, O my God, and have pity on me in keeping with your great love.
12695	16	13	23	¶Also in those days I saw the men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.
12696	16	13	24	Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod (or the language of one of the other peoples mentioned) and were unable to speak the language of Judah.
12697	16	13	25	So I entered a complaint with them. I called down a curse on them, and I struck some of the men and pulled out their hair. I had them swear by God saying, “You will not marry off your daughters to their sons, and you will not take any of their daughters as wives for your sons or for yourselves!
12698	16	13	26	Was it not because of things like these that King Solomon of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. But the foreign wives made even him sin!
12699	16	13	27	Should we then in your case hear that you do all this great evil, thereby being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign wives?”
12700	16	13	28	¶Now one of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. So I banished him from my sight.
12701	16	13	29	¶Please remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, the covenant of the priesthood, and the Levites.
12702	16	13	30	¶So I purified them of everything foreign, and I assigned specific duties to the priests and the Levites.
12703	16	13	31	I also provided for the wood offering at the appointed times and also for the first fruits. ¶Please remember me for good, O my God.
12704	17	1	1	¶The following events happened in the days of Ahasuerus. (I am referring to that Ahasuerus who used to rule over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces extending all the way from India to Ethiopia.)
12705	17	1	2	In those days, as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa the citadel,
12706	17	1	3	in the third year of his reign he provided a banquet for all his officials and his servants. The army of Persia and Media was present, as well as the nobles and the officials of the provinces.
12707	17	1	4	¶He displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his majestic greatness for a lengthy period of time – a hundred and eighty days, to be exact!
12708	17	1	5	When those days were completed, the king then provided a seven-day banquet for all the people who were present in Susa the citadel, for those of highest standing to the most lowly. It was held in the court located in the garden of the royal palace.
12709	17	1	6	The furnishings included white linen and blue curtains hung by cords of the finest linen and purple wool on silver rings, alabaster columns, gold and silver couches displayed on a floor made of valuable stones of alabaster, mother-of-pearl, and mineral stone.
12710	17	1	7	Drinks were served in golden containers, all of which differed from one another. Royal wine was available in abundance at the king’s expense.
12711	17	1	8	There were no restrictions on the drinking, for the king had instructed all of his supervisors that they should do as everyone so desired.
12712	17	1	9	Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in King Ahasuerus’ royal palace.
12713	17	1	10	¶On the seventh day, as King Ahasuerus was feeling the effects of the wine, he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who attended him,
12714	17	1	11	to bring Queen Vashti into the king’s presence wearing her royal high turban. He wanted to show the people and the officials her beauty, for she was very attractive.
12715	17	1	12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s bidding conveyed through the eunuchs. Then the king became extremely angry, and his rage consumed him.
12716	17	1	13	¶The king then inquired of the wise men who were discerners of the times – for it was the royal custom to confer with all those who were proficient in laws and legalities.
12717	17	1	14	Those who were closest to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These men were the seven officials of Persia and Media who saw the king on a regular basis and had the most prominent offices in the kingdom.
12718	17	1	15	The king asked, “By law, what should be done to Queen Vashti in light of the fact that she has not obeyed the instructions of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs?”
12719	17	1	16	¶Memucan then replied to the king and the officials, “The wrong of Queen Vashti is not against the king alone, but against all the officials and all the people who are throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.
12720	17	1	17	For the matter concerning the queen will spread to all the women, leading them to treat their husbands with contempt, saying, ‘When King Ahasuerus gave orders to bring Queen Vashti into his presence, she would not come.’
12721	17	1	18	And this very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard the matter concerning the queen will respond in the same way to all the royal officials, and there will be more than enough contempt and anger!
12722	17	1	19	If the king is so inclined, let a royal edict go forth from him, and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media that cannot be repealed, that Vashti may not come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king convey her royalty to another who is more deserving than she.
12723	17	1	20	And let the king’s decision which he will enact be disseminated throughout all his kingdom, vast though it is. Then all the women will give honor to their husbands, from the most prominent to the lowly.”
12724	17	1	21	¶The matter seemed appropriate to the king and the officials. So the king acted on the advice of Memucan.
12725	17	1	22	He sent letters throughout all the royal provinces, to each province according to its own script and to each people according to its own language, that every man should be ruling his family and should be speaking the language of his own people.
12726	17	2	1	¶When these things had been accomplished and the rage of King Ahasuerus had diminished, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decided against her.
12727	17	2	2	The king’s servants who attended him said, “Let a search be conducted on the king’s behalf for attractive young women.
12728	17	2	3	And let the king appoint officers throughout all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the attractive young women to Susa the citadel, to the harem under the authority of Hegai, the king’s eunuch who oversees the women, and let him provide whatever cosmetics they desire.
12729	17	2	4	Let the young woman whom the king finds most attractive become queen in place of Vashti.” This seemed like a good idea to the king, so he acted accordingly.
12730	17	2	5	¶Now there happened to be a Jewish man in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai. He was the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite,
12731	17	2	6	who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried into exile with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile.
12732	17	2	7	Now he was acting as the guardian of Hadassah (that is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle, for neither her father nor her mother was alive. This young woman was very attractive and had a beautiful figure. When her father and mother died, Mordecai had raised her as if she were his own daughter.
12733	17	2	8	¶It so happened that when the king’s edict and his law became known many young women were taken to Susa the citadel to be placed under the authority of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the royal palace to be under the authority of Hegai, who was overseeing the women.
12734	17	2	9	This young woman pleased him, and she found favor with him. He quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her rations; he also provided her with the seven specially chosen young women who were from the palace. He then transferred her and her young women to the best quarters in the harem.
12735	17	2	10	¶Now Esther had not disclosed her people or her lineage, for Mordecai had instructed her not to do so.
12736	17	2	11	And day after day Mordecai used to walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem in order to learn how Esther was doing and what might happen to her.
12737	17	2	12	¶At the end of the twelve months that were required for the women, when the turn of each young woman arrived to go to King Ahasuerus – for in this way they had to fulfill their time of cosmetic treatment: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfume and various ointments used by women –
12738	17	2	13	the woman would go to the king in the following way: Whatever she asked for would be provided for her to take with her from the harem to the royal palace.
12739	17	2	14	In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to a separate part of the harem, to the authority of Shaashgaz the king’s eunuch who was overseeing the concubines. She would not go back to the king unless the king was pleased with her and she was requested by name.
12740	17	2	15	¶When it became the turn of Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai (who had raised her as if she were his own daughter) to go to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai the king’s eunuch, who was overseer of the women, had recommended. Yet Esther met with the approval of all who saw her.
12741	17	2	16	Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal residence in the tenth month (that is, the month of Tebeth) in the seventh year of his reign.
12742	17	2	17	And the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she met with his loving approval more than all the other young women. So he placed the royal high turban on her head and appointed her queen in place of Vashti.
12743	17	2	18	Then the king prepared a large banquet for all his officials and his servants – it was actually Esther’s banquet. He also set aside a holiday for the provinces, and he provided for offerings at the king’s expense.
12744	17	2	19	¶Now when the young women were being gathered again, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate.
12745	17	2	20	Esther was still not divulging her lineage or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her. Esther continued to do whatever Mordecai said, just as she had done when he was raising her.
12746	17	2	21	¶In those days while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who protected the entrance, became angry and plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
12747	17	2	22	When Mordecai learned of the conspiracy, he informed Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in Mordecai’s name.
12748	17	2	23	The king then had the matter investigated and, finding it to be so, had the two conspirators hanged on a gallows. It was then recorded in the daily chronicles in the king’s presence.
12749	17	3	1	¶Some time later King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, exalting him and setting his position above that of all the officials who were with him.
12750	17	3	2	As a result, all the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate were bowing and paying homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded. However, Mordecai did not bow, nor did he pay him homage.
12751	17	3	3	¶Then the servants of the king who were at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why are you violating the king’s commandment?”
12752	17	3	4	And after they had spoken to him day after day without his paying any attention to them, they informed Haman to see whether this attitude on Mordecai’s part would be permitted. Furthermore, he had disclosed to them that he was a Jew.
12753	17	3	5	¶When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing or paying homage to him, he was filled with rage.
12754	17	3	6	But the thought of striking out against Mordecai alone was repugnant to him, for he had been informed of the identity of Mordecai’s people. So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews (that is, the people of Mordecai) who were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus.
12755	17	3	7	¶In the first month (that is, the month of Nisan), in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus’ reign, <i>pur</i> (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman in order to determine a day and a month. It turned out to be the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar).
12756	17	3	8	¶Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a particular people that is dispersed and spread among the inhabitants throughout all the provinces of your kingdom whose laws differ from those of all other peoples. Furthermore, they do not observe the king’s laws. It is not appropriate for the king to provide a haven for them.
12757	17	3	9	If the king is so inclined, let an edict be issued to destroy them. I will pay 10,000 talents of silver to be conveyed to the king’s treasuries for the officials who carry out this business.”
12758	17	3	10	¶So the king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, who was hostile toward the Jews.
12759	17	3	11	The king replied to Haman, “Keep your money, and do with those people whatever you wish.”
12760	17	3	12	¶So the royal scribes were summoned in the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month. Everything Haman commanded was written to the king’s satraps and governors who were in every province and to the officials of every people, province by province according to its script and people by people according to its language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written and sealed with the king’s signet ring.
12761	17	3	13	Letters were sent by the runners to all the king’s provinces stating that they should destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews, from youth to elderly, both women and children, on a particular day, namely the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), and to loot and plunder their possessions.
12762	17	3	14	A copy of this edict was to be presented as law throughout every province; it was to be made known to all the inhabitants, so that they would be prepared for this day.
12763	17	3	15	The messengers scurried forth with the king’s order. The edict was issued in Susa the citadel. While the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was in an uproar!
12764	17	4	1	¶Now when Mordecai became aware of all that had been done, he tore his garments and put on sackcloth and ashes. He went out into the city, crying out in a loud and bitter voice.
12765	17	4	2	But he went no further than the king’s gate, for no one was permitted to enter the king’s gate clothed in sackcloth.
12766	17	4	3	Throughout each and every province where the king’s edict and law were announced there was considerable mourning among the Jews, along with fasting, weeping, and sorrow. Sackcloth and ashes were characteristic of many.
12767	17	4	4	When Esther’s female attendants and her eunuchs came and informed her about Mordecai’s behavior, the queen was overcome with anguish. Although she sent garments for Mordecai to put on so that he could remove his sackcloth, he would not accept them.
12768	17	4	5	So Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs who had been placed at her service, and instructed him to find out the cause and reason for Mordecai’s behavior.
12769	17	4	6	So Hathach went to Mordecai at the plaza of the city in front of the king’s gate.
12770	17	4	7	Then Mordecai related to him everything that had happened to him, even the specific amount of money that Haman had offered to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews to be destroyed.
12771	17	4	8	He also gave him a written copy of the law that had been disseminated in Susa for their destruction so that he could show it to Esther and talk to her about it. He also gave instructions that she should go to the king to implore him and petition him on behalf of her people.
12772	17	4	9	So Hathach returned and related Mordecai’s instructions to Esther.
12773	17	4	10	¶Then Esther replied to Hathach with instructions for Mordecai:
12774	17	4	11	“All the servants of the king and the people of the king’s provinces know that there is only one law applicable to any man or woman who comes uninvited to the king in the inner court – that person will be put to death, unless the king extends to him the gold scepter, permitting him to be spared. Now I have not been invited to come to the king for some thirty days!”
12775	17	4	12	¶When Esther’s reply was conveyed to Mordecai,
12776	17	4	13	he said to take back this answer to Esther: “Don’t imagine that because you are part of the king’s household you will be the one Jew who will escape.
12777	17	4	14	If you keep quiet at this time, liberation and protection for the Jews will appear from another source, while you and your father’s household perish. It may very well be that you have achieved royal status for such a time as this!”
12778	17	4	15	¶Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:
12779	17	4	16	“Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa and fast in my behalf. Don’t eat and don’t drink for three days, night or day. My female attendants and I will also fast in the same way. Afterward I will go to the king, even though it violates the law. If I perish, I perish!”
12780	17	4	17	¶So Mordecai set out to do everything that Esther had instructed him.
12781	17	5	1	¶It so happened that on the third day Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the palace, opposite the king’s quarters. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the palace, opposite the entrance.
12782	17	5	2	When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she met with his approval. The king extended to Esther the gold scepter that was in his hand, and Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter.
12783	17	5	3	¶The king said to her, “What is on your mind, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even as much as half the kingdom will be given to you!”
12784	17	5	4	¶Esther replied, “If the king is so inclined, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”
12785	17	5	5	The king replied, “Find Haman quickly so that we can do as Esther requests.”¶So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
12786	17	5	6	While at the banquet of wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your request? It shall be given to you. What is your petition? Ask for as much as half the kingdom, and it shall be done!”
12787	17	5	7	¶Esther responded, “My request and my petition is this:
12788	17	5	8	If I have found favor in the king’s sight and if the king is inclined to grant my request and perform my petition, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet that I will prepare for them. At that time I will do as the king wishes.”
12789	17	5	9	¶Now Haman went forth that day pleased and very much encouraged. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king’s gate, and he did not rise nor tremble in his presence, Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai.
12790	17	5	10	But Haman restrained himself and went on to his home.¶He then sent for his friends to join him, along with his wife Zeresh.
12791	17	5	11	Haman then recounted to them his fabulous wealth, his many sons, and how the king had magnified him and exalted him over the king’s other officials and servants.
12792	17	5	12	Haman said, “Furthermore, Queen Esther invited only me to accompany the king to the banquet that she prepared! And also tomorrow I am invited along with the king.
12793	17	5	13	Yet all of this fails to satisfy me so long as I have to see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”
12794	17	5	14	¶Haman’s wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a gallows seventy-five feet high built, and in the morning tell the king that Mordecai should be hanged on it. Then go with the king to the banquet contented.” ¶It seemed like a good idea to Haman, so he had the gallows built.
12795	17	6	1	¶Throughout that night the king was unable to sleep, so he asked for the book containing the historical records to be brought. As the records were being read in the king’s presence,
12796	17	6	2	it was found written that Mordecai had disclosed that Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the entrance, had plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
12797	17	6	3	¶The king asked, “What great honor was bestowed on Mordecai because of this?” The king’s attendants who served him responded, “Not a thing was done for him.”
12798	17	6	4	¶Then the king said, “Who is that in the courtyard?” Now Haman had come to the outer courtyard of the palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had constructed for him.
12799	17	6	5	The king’s attendants said to him, “It is Haman who is standing in the courtyard.” The king said, “Let him enter.”
12800	17	6	6	¶So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haman thought to himself, “Who is it that the king would want to honor more than me?”
12801	17	6	7	So Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honor,
12802	17	6	8	let them bring royal attire which the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden – one bearing the royal insignia!
12803	17	6	9	Then let this clothing and this horse be given to one of the king’s noble officials. Let him then clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him lead him about through the plaza of the city on the horse, calling before him, ‘So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!’”
12804	17	6	10	¶The king then said to Haman, “Go quickly! Take the clothing and the horse, just as you have described, and do as you just indicated to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king’s gate. Don’t neglect a single thing of all that you have said.”
12805	17	6	11	¶So Haman took the clothing and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai. He led him about on the horse throughout the plaza of the city, calling before him, “So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!”
12806	17	6	12	¶Then Mordecai again sat at the king’s gate, while Haman hurried away to his home, mournful and with a veil over his head.
12807	17	6	13	Haman then related to his wife Zeresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. These wise men, along with his wife Zeresh, said to him, “If indeed this Mordecai before whom you have begun to fall is Jewish, you will not prevail against him. No, you will surely fall before him!”
12808	17	6	14	¶While they were still speaking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived. They quickly brought Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
12809	17	7	1	¶So the king and Haman came to dine with Queen Esther.
12810	17	7	2	On the second day of the banquet of wine the king asked Esther, “What is your request, Queen Esther? It shall be granted to you. And what is your petition? Ask up to half the kingdom, and it shall be done!”
12811	17	7	3	¶Queen Esther replied, “If I have met with your approval, O king, and if the king is so inclined, grant me my life as my request, and my people as my petition.
12812	17	7	4	For we have been sold – both I and my people – to destruction and to slaughter and to annihilation! If we had simply been sold as male and female slaves, I would have remained silent, for such distress would not have been sufficient for troubling the king.”
12813	17	7	5	¶Then King Ahasuerus responded to Queen Esther, “Who is this individual? Where is this person to be found who is presumptuous enough to act in this way?”
12814	17	7	6	¶Esther replied, “The oppressor and enemy is this evil Haman!”¶Then Haman became terrified in the presence of the king and queen.
12815	17	7	7	In rage the king arose from the banquet of wine and withdrew to the palace garden. Meanwhile, Haman stood to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he realized that the king had now determined a catastrophic end for him.
12816	17	7	8	¶When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet of wine, Haman was throwing himself down on the couch where Esther was lying. The king exclaimed, “Will he also attempt to rape the queen while I am still in the building!”¶As these words left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
12817	17	7	9	Harbona, one of the king’s eunuchs, said, “Indeed, there is the gallows that Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke out in the king’s behalf. It stands near Haman’s home and is seventy-five feet high.”¶The king said, “Hang him on it!”
12818	17	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the very gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. The king’s rage then abated.
12819	17	8	1	¶On that same day King Ahasuerus gave the estate of Haman, that adversary of the Jews, to Queen Esther. Now Mordecai had come before the king, for Esther had revealed how he was related to her.
12820	17	8	2	The king then removed his signet ring (the very one he had taken back from Haman) and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther designated Mordecai to be in charge of Haman’s estate.
12821	17	8	3	¶Then Esther again spoke with the king, falling at his feet. She wept and begged him for mercy, that he might nullify the evil of Haman the Agagite and the plot that he had intended against the Jews.
12822	17	8	4	When the king extended to Esther the gold scepter, she arose and stood before the king.
12823	17	8	5	¶She said, “If the king is so inclined and if I have met with his approval and if the matter is agreeable to the king and if I am attractive to him, let an edict be written rescinding those recorded intentions of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, which he wrote in order to destroy the Jews who are throughout all the king’s provinces.
12824	17	8	6	For how can I watch the calamity that will befall my people, and how can I watch the destruction of my relatives?”
12825	17	8	7	¶King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Look, I have already given Haman’s estate to Esther, and he has been hanged on the gallows because he took hostile action against the Jews.
12826	17	8	8	Now you write in the king’s name whatever in your opinion is appropriate concerning the Jews and seal it with the king’s signet ring. Any decree that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be rescinded.
12827	17	8	9	¶The king’s scribes were quickly summoned – in the third month (that is, the month of Sivan), on the twenty-third day. They wrote out everything that Mordecai instructed to the Jews and to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces all the way from India to Ethiopia – a hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all – to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, and to the Jews according to their own script and their own language.
12828	17	8	10	Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king’s signet ring. He then sent letters by couriers on horses, who rode royal horses that were very swift.
12829	17	8	11	¶The king thereby allowed the Jews who were in every city to assemble and to stand up for themselves – to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any army of whatever people or province that should become their adversaries, including their women and children, and to confiscate their property.
12830	17	8	12	This was to take place on a certain day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus – namely, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar).
12831	17	8	13	A copy of the edict was to be presented as law throughout each and every province and made known to all peoples, so that the Jews might be prepared on that day to avenge themselves from their enemies.
12832	17	8	14	¶The couriers who were riding the royal horses went forth with the king’s edict without delay. And the law was presented in Susa the citadel as well.
12833	17	8	15	¶Now Mordecai went out from the king’s presence in blue and white royal attire, with a large golden crown and a purple linen mantle. The city of Susa shouted with joy.
12834	17	8	16	For the Jews there was radiant happiness and joyous honor.
12835	17	8	17	Throughout every province and throughout every city where the king’s edict and his law arrived, the Jews experienced happiness and joy, banquets and holidays. Many of the resident peoples pretended to be Jews, because the fear of the Jews had overcome them.
12836	17	9	1	¶In the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), on its thirteenth day, the edict of the king and his law were to be executed. It was on this day that the enemies of the Jews had supposed that they would gain power over them. But contrary to expectations, the Jews gained power over their enemies.
12837	17	9	2	The Jews assembled themselves in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike out against those who were seeking their harm. No one was able to stand before them, for dread of them fell on all the peoples.
12838	17	9	3	All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who performed the king’s business were assisting the Jews, for the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them.
12839	17	9	4	Mordecai was of high rank in the king’s palace, and word about him was spreading throughout all the provinces. His influence continued to become greater and greater.
12840	17	9	5	¶The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, bringing death and destruction, and they did as they pleased with their enemies.
12841	17	9	6	In Susa the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.
12842	17	9	7	In addition, they also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
12843	17	9	8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
12844	17	9	9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
12845	17	9	10	the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not confiscate their property.
12846	17	9	11	¶On that same day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was brought to the king’s attention.
12847	17	9	12	Then the king said to Queen Esther, “In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman! What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? What is your request? It shall be given to you. What other petition do you have? It shall be done.”
12848	17	9	13	¶Esther replied, “If the king is so inclined, let the Jews who are in Susa be permitted to act tomorrow also according to today’s law, and let them hang the ten sons of Haman on the gallows.”
12849	17	9	14	¶So the king issued orders for this to be done. A law was passed in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.
12850	17	9	15	The Jews who were in Susa then assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they killed three hundred men in Susa. But they did not confiscate their property.
12851	17	9	16	¶The rest of the Jews who were throughout the provinces of the king assembled in order to stand up for themselves and to have rest from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of their adversaries, but they did not confiscate their property.
12852	17	9	17	All of this happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. They then rested on the fourteenth day and made it a day for banqueting and happiness.
12853	17	9	18	¶But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and rested on the fifteenth, making it a day for banqueting and happiness.
12854	17	9	19	This is why the Jews who are in the rural country – those who live in rural cities – set aside the fourteenth day of the month of Adar for happiness, banqueting, a holiday, and sending gifts to one another.
12855	17	9	20	¶Mordecai wrote these matters down and sent letters to all the Jews who were throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,
12856	17	9	21	to have them observe the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the month of Adar each year
12857	17	9	22	as the time when the Jews gave themselves rest from their enemies – the month when their trouble was turned to happiness and their mourning to a holiday. These were to be days of banqueting, happiness, sending gifts to one another, and providing for the poor.
12858	17	9	23	¶So the Jews committed themselves to continue what they had begun to do and to what Mordecai had written to them.
12859	17	9	24	For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised plans against the Jews to destroy them. He had cast <i>pur</i> (that is, the lot) in order to afflict and destroy them.
12860	17	9	25	But when the matter came to the king’s attention, the king gave written orders that Haman’s evil intentions that he had devised against the Jews should fall on his own head. He and his sons were hanged on the gallows.
12861	17	9	26	For this reason these days are known as <i>Purim</i>, after the name of <i>pur</i>. Therefore, because of the account found in this letter and what they had faced in this regard and what had happened to them,
12862	17	9	27	the Jews established as binding on themselves, their descendants, and all who joined their company that they should observe these two days without fail, just as written and at the appropriate time on an annual basis.
12863	17	9	28	These days were to be remembered and to be celebrated in every generation and in every family, every province, and every city. The Jews were not to fail to observe these days of Purim; the remembrance of them was not to cease among their descendants.
12864	17	9	29	¶So Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.
12865	17	9	30	Letters were sent to all the Jews in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the empire of Ahasuerus – words of true peace –
12866	17	9	31	to establish these days of Purim in their proper times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established, and just as they had established both for themselves and their descendants, matters pertaining to fasting and lamentation.
12867	17	9	32	Esther’s command established these matters of Purim, and the matter was officially recorded.
12868	17	10	1	¶King Ahasuerus then imposed forced labor on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.
12869	17	10	2	Now all the actions carried out under his authority and his great achievements, along with an exact statement concerning the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king promoted, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?
12870	17	10	3	Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus. He was the highest-ranking Jew, and he was admired by his numerous relatives. He worked enthusiastically for the good of his people and was an advocate for the welfare of all his descendants.
12871	18	1	1	¶There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.
12872	18	1	2	Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
12873	18	1	3	His possessions included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys; in addition he had a very great household. Thus he was the greatest of all the people in the east.
12874	18	1	4	¶Now his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one in turn, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
12875	18	1	5	When the days of their feasting were finished, Job would send for them and sanctify them; he would get up early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s customary practice.
12876	18	1	6	¶Now the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> – and Satan also arrived among them.
12877	18	1	7	The<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” And Satan answered the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span>, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it.”
12878	18	1	8	So the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil.”
12879	18	1	9	¶Then Satan answered the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span>, “Is it for nothing that Job fears God?
12880	18	1	10	Have you not made a hedge around him and his household and all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have increased in the land.
12881	18	1	11	But extend your hand and strike everything he has, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!”
12882	18	1	12	¶So the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> said to Satan, “All right then, everything he has is in your power. Only do not extend your hand against the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence of the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span>.
12883	18	1	13	¶Now the day came when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
12884	18	1	14	and a messenger came to Job, saying, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them,
12885	18	1	15	and the Sabeans swooped down and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I – only I alone – escaped to tell you!”
12886	18	1	16	¶While this one was still speaking, another messenger arrived and said, “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants – it has consumed them! And I – only I alone – escaped to tell you!”
12887	18	1	17	¶While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I – only I alone – escaped to tell you!”
12888	18	1	18	¶While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
12889	18	1	19	and suddenly a great wind swept across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they died! And I – only I alone – escaped to tell you!”
12890	18	1	20	¶Then Job got up and tore his robe. He shaved his head, and then he threw himself down with his face to the ground.
12891	18	1	21	He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. The<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> gives, and the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> takes away. May the name of the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> be blessed!”
12892	18	1	22	In all this Job did not sin, nor did he charge God with moral impropriety.
12893	18	2	1	¶Again the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span>, and Satan also arrived among them to present himself before the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span>.
12894	18	2	2	And the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> said to Satan, “Where do you come from?” Satan answered the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span>, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it.”
12895	18	2	3	Then the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a pure and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still holds firmly to his integrity, so that you stirred me up to destroy him without reason.”
12896	18	2	4	¶But Satan answered the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span>, “Skin for skin! Indeed, a man will give up all that he has to save his life!
12897	18	2	5	But extend your hand and strike his bone and his flesh, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!”
12898	18	2	6	¶So the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> said to Satan, “All right, he is in your power; only preserve his life.”
12899	18	2	7	¶So Satan went out from the presence of the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span>, and he afflicted Job with a malignant ulcer from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.
12900	18	2	8	Job took a shard of broken pottery to scrape himself with while he was sitting among the ashes.
12901	18	2	9	¶Then his wife said to him, “Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God, and die!”
12902	18	2	10	But he replied, “You’re talking like one of the godless women would do! Should we receive what is good from God, and not also receive what is evil?” In all this Job did not sin by what he said.
12903	18	2	11	¶When Job’s three friends heard about all this calamity that had happened to him, each of them came from his own country – Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to come to show sympathy for him and to console him.
12904	18	2	12	But when they gazed intently from a distance but did not recognize him, they began to weep loudly. Each of them tore his robes, and they threw dust into the air over their heads.
12905	18	2	13	Then they sat down with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, yet no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.
12906	18	3	1	¶After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.
12907	18	3	2	Job spoke up and said:
12908	18	3	3	‡“Let the day on which I was born perish,‡and the night that said, ‡‘A man has been conceived!’
12909	18	3	4	‡That day – let it be darkness; ‡let not God on high regard it,‡nor let light shine on it!
12910	18	3	5	‡Let darkness and the deepest shadow claim it; ‡let a cloud settle on it;‡let whatever blackens the day terrify it!
12911	18	3	6	‡That night – let darkness seize it;‡let it not be included among the days of the year;‡let it not enter among the number of the months!
12912	18	3	7	‡Indeed, let that night be barren; ‡let no shout of joy penetrate it!
12913	18	3	8	‡Let those who curse the day curse it – ‡those who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.
12914	18	3	9	‡Let its morning stars be darkened;‡let it wait for daylight but find none, ‡nor let it see the first rays of dawn,
12915	18	3	10	‡because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb on me, ‡nor did it hide trouble from my eyes!
12916	18	3	11	‡“Why did I not die at birth, ‡and why did I not expire ‡as I came out of the womb?
12917	18	3	12	‡Why did the knees welcome me, ‡and why were there two breasts ‡that I might nurse at them?
12918	18	3	13	‡For now I would be lying down ‡and would be quiet, ‡I would be asleep and then at peace
12919	18	3	14	‡with kings and counselors of the earth‡who built for themselves places now desolate,
12920	18	3	15	‡or with princes who possessed gold, ‡who filled their palaces with silver.
12921	18	3	16	‡Or why was I not buried ‡like a stillborn infant, ‡like infants who have never seen the light?
12922	18	3	17	‡There the wicked cease from turmoil, ‡and there the weary are at rest.
12923	18	3	18	‡There the prisoners relax together; ‡they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
12924	18	3	19	‡Small and great are there, ‡and the slave is free from his master.
12925	18	3	20	‡“Why does God give light to one who is in misery, ‡and life to those whose soul is bitter,
12926	18	3	21	‡to those who wait for death that does not come,‡and search for it ‡more than for hidden treasures,
12927	18	3	22	‡who rejoice even to jubilation, ‡and are exultant when they find the grave?
12928	18	3	23	‡Why is light given to a man ‡whose way is hidden, ‡and whom God has hedged in?
12929	18	3	24	‡For my sighing comes in place of my food, ‡and my groanings flow forth like water.
12930	18	3	25	‡For the very thing I dreaded has happened to me, ‡and what I feared has come upon me.
12931	18	3	26	‡I have no ease, I have no quietness;‡I cannot rest; turmoil has come upon me.”
12932	18	4	1	¶Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
12933	18	4	2	‡“If someone should attempt a word with you, ‡will you be impatient? ‡But who can refrain from speaking ?
12934	18	4	3	‡Look, you have instructed many;‡you have strengthened feeble hands.
12935	18	4	4	‡Your words have supported those ‡who stumbled, ‡and you have strengthened the knees ‡that gave way.
12936	18	4	5	‡But now the same thing comes to you, ‡and you are discouraged; ‡it strikes you, ‡and you are terrified.
12937	18	4	6	‡Is not your piety your confidence, ‡and your blameless ways your hope?
12938	18	4	7	‡Call to mind now: ‡Who, being innocent, ever perished? ‡And where were upright people ever destroyed?
12939	18	4	8	‡Even as I have seen, those who plow iniquity ‡and those who sow trouble reap the same.
12940	18	4	9	‡By the breath of God they perish, ‡and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.
12941	18	4	10	‡There is the roaring of the lion ‡and the growling of the young lion,‡but the teeth of the young lions are broken.
12942	18	4	11	‡The mighty lion perishes for lack of prey,‡and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
12943	18	4	12	‡“Now a word was secretly brought to me,‡and my ear caught a whisper of it.
12944	18	4	13	‡In the troubling thoughts of the dreams in the night‡when a deep sleep falls on men,
12945	18	4	14	‡dread gripped me and trembling, ‡which made all my bones shake.
12946	18	4	15	‡Then a breath of air passes by my face;‡it makes the hair of my flesh stand up.
12947	18	4	16	‡It stands still, ‡but I cannot recognize its appearance;‡an image is before my eyes, ‡and I hear a murmuring voice:
12948	18	4	17	‡“Is a mortal man righteous before God?‡Or a man pure before his Creator?
12949	18	4	18	‡If God puts no trust in his servants ‡and attributes folly to his angels,
12950	18	4	19	‡how much more to those who live in houses of clay, ‡whose foundation is in the dust,‡who are crushed like a moth?
12951	18	4	20	‡They are destroyed between morning and evening; ‡they perish forever without anyone regarding it.
12952	18	4	21	‡Is not their excess wealth taken away from them? ‡They die, yet without attaining wisdom.
12953	18	5	1	‡“Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you? ‡To which of the holy ones will you turn?
12954	18	5	2	‡For wrath kills the foolish person, ‡and anger slays the silly one.
12955	18	5	3	‡I myself have seen the fool taking root,‡but suddenly I cursed his place of residence.
12956	18	5	4	‡His children are far from safety,‡and they are crushed at the place where judgment is rendered, ‡nor is there anyone to deliver them.
12957	18	5	5	‡The hungry eat up his harvest, ‡and take it even from behind the thorns, ‡and the thirsty pant for their wealth.
12958	18	5	6	‡For evil does not come up from the dust, ‡nor does trouble spring up from the ground,
12959	18	5	7	‡but people are born to trouble,‡as surely as the sparks fly upward.
12960	18	5	8	‡“But as for me, I would seek God, ‡and to God I would set forth my case.
12961	18	5	9	‡He does great and unsearchable things,‡marvelous things without number;
12962	18	5	10	‡he gives rain on the earth, ‡and sends water on the fields;
12963	18	5	11	‡he sets the lowly on high,‡that those who mourn are raised to safety.
12964	18	5	12	‡He frustrates the plans of the crafty ‡so that their hands cannot accomplish ‡what they had planned!
12965	18	5	13	‡He catches the wise in their own craftiness, ‡and the counsel of the cunning is brought to a quick end.
12966	18	5	14	‡They meet with darkness in the daytime, ‡and grope about in the noontime as if it were night.
12967	18	5	15	‡So he saves from the sword that comes from their mouth, ‡even the poor from the hand of the powerful.
12968	18	5	16	‡Thus the poor have hope, ‡and iniquity shuts its mouth.
12969	18	5	17	‡“Therefore, blessed is the man whom God corrects, ‡so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
12970	18	5	18	‡For he wounds, but he also bandages;‡he strikes, but his hands also heal.
12971	18	5	19	‡He will deliver you from six calamities;‡yes, in seven no evil will touch you.
12972	18	5	20	‡In time of famine he will redeem you from death,‡and in time of war from the power of the sword.
12973	18	5	21	‡You will be protected from malicious gossip, ‡and will not be afraid of the destruction when it comes.
12974	18	5	22	‡You will laugh at destruction and famine ‡and need not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
12975	18	5	23	‡For you will have a pact with the stones of the field,‡and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
12976	18	5	24	‡And you will know that your home will be secure, ‡and when you inspect your domains, ‡you will not be missing anything.
12977	18	5	25	‡You will also know that your children will be numerous,‡and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
12978	18	5	26	‡You will come to your grave in a full age, ‡As stacks of grain are harvested in their season.
12979	18	5	27	‡Look, we have investigated this, so it is true.‡Hear it, and apply it for your own good.”
12980	18	6	1	¶Then Job responded:
12981	18	6	2	‡“Oh, if only my grief could be weighed, ‡and my misfortune laid on the scales too!
12982	18	6	3	‡But because it is heavier than the sand of the sea,‡that is why my words have been wild.
12983	18	6	4	‡For the arrows of the Almighty are within me;‡my spirit drinks their poison; ‡God’s sudden terrors are arrayed against me.
12984	18	6	5	‡“Does the wild donkey bray when it is near grass? ‡Or does the ox bellow over its fodder?
12985	18	6	6	‡Can food that is tasteless be eaten without salt?‡Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
12986	18	6	7	‡I have refused to touch such things; ‡they are like loathsome food to me.
12987	18	6	8	‡“Oh that my request would be realized, ‡and that God would grant me what I long for!
12988	18	6	9	‡And that God would be willing to crush me,‡that he would let loose his hand ‡and kill me.
12989	18	6	10	‡Then I would yet have my comfort, ‡then I would rejoice, ‡in spite of pitiless pain, ‡for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
12990	18	6	11	‡What is my strength, that I should wait? ‡and what is my end, ‡that I should prolong my life?
12991	18	6	12	‡Is my strength like that of stones? ‡or is my flesh made of bronze?
12992	18	6	13	‡Is not my power to help myself nothing,‡and has not every resource been driven from me?
12993	18	6	14	‡“To the one in despair, kindness should come from his friend ‡even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
12994	18	6	15	‡My brothers have been as treacherous as a seasonal stream, ‡and as the riverbeds of the intermittent streams ‡that flow away.
12995	18	6	16	‡They are dark because of ice;‡snow is piled up over them.
12996	18	6	17	‡When they are scorched, they dry up,‡when it is hot, they vanish from their place.
12997	18	6	18	‡Caravans turn aside from their routes;‡they go into the wasteland and perish.
12998	18	6	19	‡The caravans of Tema looked intently for these streams; ‡the traveling merchants of Sheba hoped for them.
12999	18	6	20	‡They were distressed, ‡because each one had been so confident;‡they arrived there, but were disappointed.
13000	18	6	21	‡For now you have become like these streams that are no help; ‡you see a terror, and are afraid.
13001	18	6	22	‡“Have I ever said, ‘Give me something,‡and from your fortune make gifts in my favor’?
13002	18	6	23	‡Or ‘Deliver me from the enemy’s power, ‡and from the hand of tyrants ransom me’?
13003	18	6	24	‡“Teach me and I, for my part, will be silent;‡explain to me how I have been mistaken.
13004	18	6	25	‡How painful are honest words!‡But what does your reproof prove?
13005	18	6	26	‡Do you intend to criticize mere words,‡and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?
13006	18	6	27	‡Yes, you would gamble for the fatherless,‡and auction off your friend.
13007	18	6	28	‡“Now then, be good enough to look at me; ‡and I will not lie to your face!
13008	18	6	29	‡Relent, let there be no falsehood; ‡reconsider, for my righteousness is intact!
13009	18	6	30	‡Is there any falsehood on my lips?‡Can my mouth not discern evil things?
13010	18	7	1	‡“Does not humanity have hard service on earth?‡Are not their days also ‡like the days of a hired man?
13011	18	7	2	‡Like a servant longing for the evening shadow, ‡and like a hired man looking for his wages,
13012	18	7	3	‡thus I have been made to inherit ‡months of futility, ‡and nights of sorrow ‡have been appointed to me.
13013	18	7	4	‡If I lie down, I say, ‘When will I arise?’,‡and the night stretches on ‡and I toss and turn restlessly ‡until the day dawns.
13014	18	7	5	‡My body is clothed with worms and dirty scabs; ‡my skin is broken and festering.
13015	18	7	6	‡My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle ‡and they come to an end without hope.
13016	18	7	7	‡Remember that my life is but a breath,‡that my eyes will never again see happiness.
13017	18	7	8	‡The eye of him who sees me now will see me no more; ‡your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.
13018	18	7	9	‡As a cloud is dispersed and then disappears, ‡so the one who goes down to the grave ‡does not come up again.
13019	18	7	10	‡He returns no more to his house,‡nor does his place of residence know him any more.
13020	18	7	11	‡“Therefore, I will not refrain my mouth; ‡I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;‡I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
13021	18	7	12	‡Am I the sea, or the creature of the deep, ‡that you must put me under guard?
13022	18	7	13	‡If I say, “My bed will comfort me, ‡my couch will ease my complaint,”
13023	18	7	14	‡then you scare me with dreams‡and terrify me with visions,
13024	18	7	15	‡so that I would prefer strangling, ‡and death more than life.
13025	18	7	16	‡I loathe it; I do not want to live forever;‡leave me alone, for my days are a vapor!
13026	18	7	17	‡“What is mankind that you make so much of them, ‡and that you pay attention to them?

13031	18	8	1	¶Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke up and said:
13032	18	8	2	‡“How long will you speak these things, ‡seeing that the words of your mouth ‡are like a great wind?
13033	18	8	3	‡Does God pervert justice? ‡Or does the Almighty pervert what is right?
13034	18	8	4	‡If your children sinned against him,‡he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
13035	18	8	5	‡But if you will look to God,‡and make your supplication to the Almighty,
13036	18	8	6	‡if you become pure and upright, ‡even now he will rouse himself for you,‡and will restore your righteous home.
13037	18	8	7	‡Your beginning will seem so small,‡since your future will flourish.
13038	18	8	8	‡“For inquire now of the former generation,‡and pay attention to the findings ‡of their ancestors;
13039	18	8	9	‡For we were born yesterday and do not have knowledge,‡since our days on earth are but a shadow.
13040	18	8	10	‡Will they not instruct you and speak to you,‡and bring forth words ‡from their understanding?

13042	18	8	12	‡While they are still beginning to flower ‡and not ripe for cutting, ‡they can wither away ‡faster than any grass!
13043	18	8	13	‡Such is the destiny of all who forget God;‡the hope of the godless perishes,

13048	18	8	18	‡If he is uprooted from his place,‡then that place will disown him, saying, ‡‘I have never seen you!’
13049	18	8	19	‡Indeed, this is the joy of his way, ‡and out of the earth others spring up.
13050	18	8	20	‡“Surely, God does not reject a blameless man, ‡nor does he grasp the hand ‡of the evildoers.

13053	18	9	1	¶Then Job answered:
13054	18	9	2	‡“Truly, I know that this is so.‡But how can a human be just before God?

13057	18	9	5	‡He who removes mountains suddenly, ‡who overturns them in his anger;
13058	18	9	6	‡he who shakes the earth out of its place ‡so that its pillars tremble;

13060	18	9	8	‡he alone spreads out the heavens,‡and treads on the waves of the sea;
13061	18	9	9	‡he makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, ‡and the constellations of the southern sky;

13069	18	9	17	‡he who crushes me with a tempest,‡and multiplies my wounds for no reason.

13071	18	9	19	‡If it is a matter of strength, ‡most certainly he is the strong one!‡And if it is a matter of justice, ‡he will say, ‘Who will summon me?’
13072	18	9	20	‡Although I am innocent, ‡my mouth would condemn me; ‡although I am blameless, ‡it would declare me perverse.
13073	18	9	21	‡I am blameless. I do not know myself. ‡I despise my life.

13090	18	10	3	‡Is it good for you to oppress, ‡to despise the work of your hands,‡while you smile ‡on the schemes of the wicked?

13110	18	11	1	¶Then Zophar the Naamathite spoke up and said:
13111	18	11	2	‡“Should not this abundance of words be answered, ‡or should this talkative man ‡be vindicated?
13112	18	11	3	‡Should people remain silent at your idle talk, ‡and should no one rebuke you when you mock?

13116	18	11	7	‡“Can you discover the essence of God?‡Can you find out the perfection of the Almighty?
13117	18	11	8	‡It is higher than the heavens – what can you do?‡It is deeper than Sheol – what can you know?

13122	18	11	13	‡“As for you, if you prove faithful, ‡and if you stretch out your hands toward him,
13123	18	11	14	‡if iniquity is in your hand – put it far away, ‡and do not let evil reside in your tents.

13125	18	11	16	‡For you will forget your trouble; ‡you will remember it ‡like water that has flowed away.
13126	18	11	17	‡And life will be brighter than the noonday;‡though there be darkness, ‡it will be like the morning.
13127	18	11	18	‡And you will be secure, because there is hope;‡you will be protected ‡and will take your rest in safety.

13129	18	11	20	‡But the eyes of the wicked fail, ‡and escape eludes them;‡their one hope is to breathe their last.”
13130	18	12	1	¶Then Job answered:

13145	18	12	16	‡With him are strength and prudence; ‡both the one who goes astray ‡and the one who misleads are his.
13146	18	12	17	‡He leads counselors away stripped ‡and makes judges into fools.

13148	18	12	19	‡He leads priests away stripped ‡and overthrows the potentates.
13149	18	12	20	‡He deprives the trusted advisers of speech ‡and takes away the discernment of elders.
13150	18	12	21	‡He pours contempt on noblemen‡and disarms the powerful.

13236	18	15	32	‡Before his time he will be paid in full, ‡and his branches will not flourish.
13237	18	15	33	‡Like a vine he will let his sour grapes fall, ‡and like an olive tree ‡he will shed his blossoms.
13238	18	15	34	‡For the company of the godless is barren, ‡and fire consumes the tents of those who accept bribes.
13239	18	15	35	‡They conceive trouble and bring forth evil;‡their belly prepares deception.”
13240	18	16	1	¶Then Job replied:
13241	18	16	2	‡“I have heard many things like these before.‡What miserable comforters are you all!
13242	18	16	3	‡Will there be an end to your windy words? ‡Or what provokes you that you answer?
13243	18	16	4	‡I also could speak like you,‡if you were in my place;‡I could pile up words against you‡and I could shake my head at you.
13244	18	16	5	‡But I would strengthen you with my words; ‡comfort from my lips would bring you relief.
13245	18	16	6	‡“But if I speak, my pain is not relieved, ‡and if I refrain from speaking‡– how much of it goes away?
13246	18	16	7	‡Surely now he has worn me out,‡you have devastated my entire household.
13247	18	16	8	‡You have seized me, ‡and it has become a witness;‡my leanness has risen up against me ‡and testifies against me.
13248	18	16	9	‡His anger has torn me and persecuted me;‡he has gnashed at me with his teeth;‡my adversary locks his eyes on me.
13249	18	16	10	‡People have opened their mouths against me,‡they have struck my cheek in scorn; ‡they unite together against me.
13250	18	16	11	‡God abandons me to evil men, ‡and throws me into the hands of wicked men.
13251	18	16	12	‡I was in peace, and he has shattered me. ‡He has seized me by the neck and crushed me. ‡He has made me his target;
13252	18	16	13	‡his archers surround me.‡Without pity he pierces my kidneys‡and pours out my gall on the ground.
13253	18	16	14	‡He breaks through against me, time and time again; ‡he rushes against me like a warrior.
13254	18	16	15	‡I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, ‡and buried my horn in the dust;
13255	18	16	16	‡my face is reddened because of weeping, ‡and on my eyelids there is a deep darkness,
13256	18	16	17	‡although there is no violence in my hands‡and my prayer is pure.
13257	18	16	18	‡“O earth, do not cover my blood, ‡nor let there be a secret place for my cry.
13258	18	16	19	‡Even now my witness is in heaven;‡my advocate is on high.
13259	18	16	20	‡My intercessor is my friend ‡as my eyes pour out tears to God;
13260	18	16	21	‡and he contends with God on behalf of man‡as a man pleads for his friend.
13261	18	16	22	‡For the years that lie ahead are few, ‡and then I will go on the way of no return.
13262	18	17	1	‡My spirit is broken, ‡my days have faded out, ‡the grave awaits me.
13263	18	17	2	‡Surely mockery is with me; ‡my eyes must dwell on their hostility.
13264	18	17	3	‡Set my pledge beside you.‡Who else will put up security for me?
13265	18	17	4	‡Because you have closed their minds to understanding,‡therefore you will not exalt them.
13266	18	17	5	‡If a man denounces his friends for personal gain, ‡the eyes of his children will fail.
13267	18	17	6	‡He has made me a byword to people,‡I am the one in whose face they spit.
13268	18	17	7	‡My eyes have grown dim with grief;‡my whole frame is but a shadow.
13269	18	17	8	‡Upright men are appalled at this;‡the innocent man is troubled with the godless.
13270	18	17	9	‡But the righteous man holds to his way,‡and the one with clean hands grows stronger.
13271	18	17	10	‡“But turn, all of you, and come now! ‡I will not find a wise man among you.
13272	18	17	11	‡My days have passed, my plans are shattered,‡even the desires of my heart.
13273	18	17	12	‡These men change night into day;‡they say, ‘The light is near ‡in the face of darkness.’
13274	18	17	13	‡If I hope for the grave to be my home,‡if I spread out my bed in darkness,
13275	18	17	14	‡If I cry to corruption, ‘You are my father,’‡and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ or ‘My sister,’
13276	18	17	15	‡where then is my hope?‡And my hope, who sees it?
13277	18	17	16	‡Will it go down to the barred gates of death?‡Will we descend together into the dust?”
13278	18	18	1	¶Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
13279	18	18	2	‡“How long until you make an end of words? ‡You must consider, and then we can talk.
13280	18	18	3	‡Why should we be regarded as beasts,‡and considered stupid in your sight?
13281	18	18	4	‡You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger,‡will the earth be abandoned for your sake?‡Or will a rock be moved from its place?
13282	18	18	5	‡“Yes, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished;‡his flame of fire does not shine.
13283	18	18	6	‡The light in his tent grows dark;‡his lamp above him is extinguished.
13284	18	18	7	‡His vigorous steps are restricted, ‡and his own counsel throws him down.
13285	18	18	8	‡For he has been thrown into a net by his feet ‡and he wanders into a mesh.
13286	18	18	9	‡A trap seizes him by the heel;‡a snare grips him.
13287	18	18	10	‡A rope is hidden for him on the ground‡and a trap for him lies on the path.
13288	18	18	11	‡Terrors frighten him on all sides‡and dog his every step.
13289	18	18	12	‡Calamity is hungry for him, ‡and misfortune is ready at his side.
13290	18	18	13	‡It eats away parts of his skin; ‡the most terrible death devours his limbs.
13291	18	18	14	‡He is dragged from the security of his tent, ‡and marched off to the king of terrors.
13292	18	18	15	‡Fire resides in his tent; ‡over his residence burning sulfur is scattered.
13293	18	18	16	‡Below his roots dry up,‡and his branches wither above.
13294	18	18	17	‡His memory perishes from the earth,‡he has no name in the land.
13295	18	18	18	‡He is driven from light into darkness‡and is banished from the world.
13296	18	18	19	‡He has neither children nor descendants among his people,‡no survivor in those places he once stayed.
13297	18	18	20	‡People of the west are appalled at his fate; ‡people of the east are seized with horror, saying,
13298	18	18	21	‡‘Surely such is the residence of an evil man;‡and this is the place of one who has not known God.’”
13299	18	19	1	¶Then Job answered:
13300	18	19	2	‡“How long will you torment me ‡and crush me with your words?
13301	18	19	3	‡These ten times you have been reproaching me; ‡you are not ashamed to attack me!
13302	18	19	4	‡But even if it were true that I have erred, ‡my error remains solely my concern!
13303	18	19	5	‡If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me‡and plead my disgrace against me,
13304	18	19	6	‡know then that God has wronged me ‡and encircled me with his net.
13305	18	19	7	‡“If I cry out, ‘Violence!’ ‡I receive no answer; ‡I cry for help, ‡but there is no justice.
13306	18	19	8	‡He has blocked my way so I cannot pass,‡and has set darkness over my paths.
13307	18	19	9	‡He has stripped me of my honor‡and has taken the crown off my head.
13308	18	19	10	‡He tears me down on every side until I perish; ‡he uproots my hope like an uprooted tree.
13309	18	19	11	‡Thus his anger burns against me,‡and he considers me among his enemies.
13310	18	19	12	‡His troops advance together;‡they throw up a siege ramp against me,‡and they camp around my tent.
13311	18	19	13	‡“He has put my relatives far from me;‡my acquaintances only turn away from me.
13312	18	19	14	‡My kinsmen have failed me;‡my friends have forgotten me.
13313	18	19	15	‡My guests and my servant girls ‡consider me a stranger;‡I am a foreigner in their eyes.
13314	18	19	16	‡I summon my servant, but he does not respond,‡even though I implore him with my own mouth.
13315	18	19	17	‡My breath is repulsive to my wife;‡I am loathsome to my brothers.
13316	18	19	18	‡Even youngsters have scorned me;‡when I get up, they scoff at me.
13317	18	19	19	‡All my closest friends detest me;‡and those whom I love have turned against me.
13318	18	19	20	‡My bones stick to my skin and my flesh; ‡I have escaped alive with only the skin of my teeth.
13319	18	19	21	‡Have pity on me, my friends, have pity on me,‡for the hand of God has struck me.
13320	18	19	22	‡Why do you pursue me like God does? ‡Will you never be satiated with my flesh?
13321	18	19	23	‡“O that my words were written down,‡O that they were written on a scroll,
13322	18	19	24	‡that with an iron chisel and with lead ‡they were engraved in a rock forever!
13323	18	19	25	‡As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,‡and that as the last ‡he will stand upon the earth.
13324	18	19	26	‡And after my skin has been destroyed, ‡yet in my flesh I will see God,
13325	18	19	27	‡whom I will see for myself, ‡and whom my own eyes will behold, ‡and not another. ‡My heart grows faint within me.
13326	18	19	28	‡If you say, ‘How we will pursue him,‡since the root of the trouble is found in him!’
13327	18	19	29	‡Fear the sword yourselves,‡for wrath brings the punishment by the sword,‡so that you may know ‡that there is judgment.”
13328	18	20	1	¶Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
13329	18	20	2	‡“This is why my troubled thoughts bring me back –‡because of my feelings within me.
13330	18	20	3	‡When I hear a reproof that dishonors me,‡then my understanding prompts me to answer.
13331	18	20	4	‡“Surely you know that it has been from old,‡ever since humankind was placed on the earth,
13332	18	20	5	‡that the elation of the wicked is brief, ‡the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.
13333	18	20	6	‡Even though his stature reaches to the heavens‡and his head touches the clouds,
13334	18	20	7	‡he will perish forever, like his own excrement; ‡those who used to see him will say, ‘Where is he?’
13335	18	20	8	‡Like a dream he flies away, never again to be found, ‡and like a vision of the night he is put to flight.
13336	18	20	9	‡People who had seen him will not see him again,‡and the place where he was ‡will recognize him no longer.
13337	18	20	10	‡His sons must recompense the poor;‡his own hands must return his wealth.
13338	18	20	11	‡His bones were full of his youthful vigor, ‡but that vigor will lie down with him in the dust.
13339	18	20	12	‡“If evil is sweet in his mouth‡and he hides it under his tongue,
13340	18	20	13	‡if he retains it for himself‡and does not let it go,‡and holds it fast in his mouth,
13341	18	20	14	‡his food is turned sour in his stomach; ‡it becomes the venom of serpents within him.
13342	18	20	15	‡The wealth that he consumed he vomits up,‡God will make him throw it out of his stomach.
13343	18	20	16	‡He sucks the poison of serpents; ‡the fangs of a viper kill him.
13344	18	20	17	‡He will not look on the streams, ‡the rivers, which are the torrents ‡of honey and butter.
13345	18	20	18	‡He gives back the ill-gotten gain ‡without assimilating it; ‡he will not enjoy the wealth from his commerce.
13346	18	20	19	‡For he has oppressed the poor and abandoned them; ‡he has seized a house which he did not build.
13347	18	20	20	‡For he knows no satisfaction in his appetite; ‡he does not let anything he desires escape.
13348	18	20	21	‡“Nothing is left for him to devour; ‡that is why his prosperity does not last.
13349	18	20	22	‡In the fullness of his sufficiency, ‡distress overtakes him.‡The full force of misery will come upon him.
13350	18	20	23	‡“While he is filling his belly,‡God sends his burning anger against him,‡and rains down his blows upon him.
13351	18	20	24	‡If he flees from an iron weapon,‡then an arrow from a bronze bow pierces him.
13352	18	20	25	‡When he pulls it out and it comes out of his back,‡the gleaming point out of his liver,‡terrors come over him.
13353	18	20	26	‡Total darkness waits to receive his treasures; ‡a fire which has not been kindled ‡will consume him‡and devour what is left in his tent.
13354	18	20	27	‡The heavens reveal his iniquity;‡the earth rises up against him.
13355	18	20	28	‡A flood will carry off his house,‡rushing waters on the day of God’s wrath.
13356	18	20	29	‡Such is the lot God allots the wicked,‡and the heritage of his appointment from God.”
13357	18	21	1	¶Then Job answered:
13358	18	21	2	‡“Listen carefully to my words;‡let this be the consolation you offer me.
13359	18	21	3	‡Bear with me and I will speak,‡and after I have spoken you may mock.
13360	18	21	4	‡Is my complaint against a man? ‡If so, why should I not be impatient?
13361	18	21	5	‡Look at me and be appalled;‡put your hands over your mouths.
13362	18	21	6	‡For, when I think about this, I am terrified ‡and my body feels a shudder.
13363	18	21	7	‡“Why do the wicked go on living, ‡grow old, even increase in power?
13364	18	21	8	‡Their children are firmly established ‡in their presence, ‡their offspring before their eyes.
13365	18	21	9	‡Their houses are safe and without fear; ‡and no rod of punishment from God is upon them.
13366	18	21	10	‡Their bulls breed without fail; ‡their cows calve and do not miscarry.
13367	18	21	11	‡They allow their children to run like a flock;‡their little ones dance about.
13368	18	21	12	‡They sing to the accompaniment of tambourine and harp,‡and make merry to the sound of the flute.
13369	18	21	13	‡They live out their years in prosperity‡and go down to the grave in peace.
13370	18	21	14	‡So they say to God, ‘Turn away from us!‡We do not want to know your ways.
13371	18	21	15	‡Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him?‡What would we gain ‡if we were to pray to him?’
13372	18	21	16	‡But their prosperity is not their own doing. ‡The counsel of the wicked is far from me!
13373	18	21	17	‡“How often is the lamp of the wicked extinguished?‡How often does their misfortune come upon them?‡How often does God apportion pain to them in his anger?
13374	18	21	18	‡How often are they like straw before the wind,‡and like chaff swept away by a whirlwind?
13375	18	21	19	‡You may say, ‘God stores up a man’s punishment for his children!’ ‡Instead let him repay the man himself ‡so that he may be humbled!
13376	18	21	20	‡Let his own eyes see his destruction; ‡let him drink of the anger of the Almighty.
13377	18	21	21	‡For what is his interest in his home ‡after his death, ‡when the number of his months ‡has been broken off?
13378	18	21	22	‡Can anyone teach God knowledge,‡since he judges those that are on high?
13379	18	21	23	‡“One man dies in his full vigor, ‡completely secure and prosperous,
13380	18	21	24	‡his body well nourished, ‡and the marrow of his bones moist.
13381	18	21	25	‡And another man dies in bitterness of soul, ‡never having tasted anything good.
13382	18	21	26	‡Together they lie down in the dust,‡and worms cover over them both.
13383	18	21	27	‡“Yes, I know what you are thinking, ‡the schemes by which you would wrong me.
13384	18	21	28	‡For you say, ‡‘Where now is the nobleman’s house, ‡and where are the tents in which the wicked lived?’
13385	18	21	29	‡Have you never questioned those who travel the roads?‡Do you not recognize their accounts –
13386	18	21	30	‡that the evil man is spared‡from the day of his misfortune,‡that he is delivered ‡from the day of God’s wrath?
13387	18	21	31	‡No one denounces his conduct to his face;‡no one repays him for what he has done.
13388	18	21	32	‡And when he is carried to the tombs,‡and watch is kept over the funeral mound,
13389	18	21	33	‡The clods of the torrent valley are sweet to him;‡behind him everybody follows in procession,‡and before him goes a countless throng.
13390	18	21	34	‡So how can you console me with your futile words?‡Nothing is left of your answers but deception!”
13391	18	22	1	¶Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
13392	18	22	2	‡“Is it to God that a strong man is of benefit?‡Is it to him that even a wise man is profitable?
13393	18	22	3	‡Is it of any special benefit to the Almighty‡that you should be righteous,‡or is it any gain to him‡that you make your ways blameless?
13394	18	22	4	‡Is it because of your piety that he rebukes you‡and goes to judgment with you?
13395	18	22	5	‡Is not your wickedness great ‡and is there no end to your iniquity?
13396	18	22	6	‡“For you took pledges from your brothers ‡for no reason,‡and you stripped the clothing from the naked.
13397	18	22	7	‡You gave the weary no water to drink‡and from the hungry you withheld food.
13398	18	22	8	‡Although you were a powerful man, owning land, ‡an honored man living on it,
13399	18	22	9	‡you sent widows away empty-handed,‡and the arms of the orphans you crushed.
13400	18	22	10	‡That is why snares surround you,‡and why sudden fear terrifies you,
13401	18	22	11	‡why it is so dark you cannot see, ‡and why a flood of water covers you.
13402	18	22	12	‡“Is not God on high in heaven? ‡And see the lofty stars, how high they are!
13403	18	22	13	‡But you have said, ‘What does God know?‡Does he judge through such deep darkness?
13404	18	22	14	‡Thick clouds are a veil for him, so he does not see us, ‡as he goes back and forth‡in the vault of heaven.’
13405	18	22	15	‡Will you keep to the old path ‡that evil men have walked –
13406	18	22	16	‡men who were carried off before their time, ‡when the flood was poured out ‡on their foundations?
13407	18	22	17	‡They were saying to God, ‘Turn away from us,’‡and ‘What can the Almighty do to us?’
13408	18	22	18	‡But it was he who filled their houses ‡with good things – ‡yet the counsel of the wicked ‡was far from me.
13409	18	22	19	‡The righteous see their destruction and rejoice;‡the innocent mock them scornfully, saying,
13410	18	22	20	‡‘Surely our enemies are destroyed,‡and fire consumes their wealth.’
13411	18	22	21	‡“Reconcile yourself with God, ‡and be at peace with him;‡in this way your prosperity will be good.
13412	18	22	22	‡Accept instruction from his mouth‡and store up his words in your heart.
13413	18	22	23	‡If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up; ‡if you remove wicked behavior far from your tent,
13414	18	22	24	‡and throw your gold in the dust – ‡your gold of Ophir ‡among the rocks in the ravines –
13415	18	22	25	‡then the Almighty himself will be your gold, ‡and the choicest silver for you.
13416	18	22	26	‡Surely then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,‡and will lift up your face toward God.
13417	18	22	27	‡You will pray to him and he will hear you,‡and you will fulfill your vows to him.
13418	18	22	28	‡Whatever you decide on a matter,‡it will be established for you,‡and light will shine on your ways.
13419	18	22	29	‡When people are brought low and you say‡‘Lift them up!’ ‡then he will save the downcast;
13420	18	22	30	‡he will deliver even someone who is not innocent, ‡who will escape through the cleanness of your hands.”
13421	18	23	1	¶Then Job answered:
13422	18	23	2	‡“Even today my complaint is still bitter; ‡his hand is heavy despite my groaning.
13423	18	23	3	‡O that I knew where I might find him, ‡that I could come to his place of residence!

13425	18	23	5	‡I would know with what words he would answer me,‡and understand what he would say to me.
13426	18	23	6	‡Would he contend with me with great power?‡No, he would only pay attention to me.
13427	18	23	7	‡There an upright person ‡could present his case before him,‡and I would be delivered forever from my judge.
13428	18	23	8	‡“If I go to the east, he is not there,‡and to the west, yet I do not perceive him.
13429	18	23	9	‡In the north when he is at work, ‡I do not see him; ‡when he turns to the south, ‡I see no trace of him.
13430	18	23	10	‡But he knows the pathway that I take; ‡if he tested me, I would come forth like gold.
13431	18	23	11	‡My feet have followed his steps closely;‡I have kept to his way and have not turned aside.
13432	18	23	12	‡I have not departed from the commands of his lips;‡I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my allotted portion.
13433	18	23	13	‡But he is unchangeable, and who can change him?‡Whatever he has desired, he does.
13434	18	23	14	‡For he fulfills his decree against me, ‡and many such things are his plans.
13435	18	23	15	‡That is why I am terrified in his presence;‡when I consider, I am afraid because of him.
13436	18	23	16	‡Indeed, God has made my heart faint; ‡the Almighty has terrified me.
13437	18	23	17	‡Yet I have not been silent because of the darkness,‡because of the thick darkness ‡that covered my face.
13438	18	24	1	‡“Why are times not appointed by the Almighty? ‡Why do those who know him not see his days?
13439	18	24	2	‡Men move boundary stones;‡they seize the flock and pasture them.
13440	18	24	3	‡They drive away the orphan’s donkey;‡they take the widow’s ox as a pledge.
13441	18	24	4	‡They turn the needy from the pathway,‡and the poor of the land hide themselves together.
13442	18	24	5	‡Like wild donkeys in the wilderness,‡they go out to their labor seeking diligently for food;‡the arid rift valley provides food for them and for their children.
13443	18	24	6	‡They reap fodder in the field,‡and glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
13444	18	24	7	‡They spend the night naked because they lack clothing;‡they have no covering against the cold.
13445	18	24	8	‡They are soaked by mountain rains‡and huddle in the rocks because they lack shelter.
13446	18	24	9	‡The fatherless child is snatched from the breast, ‡the infant of the poor is taken as a pledge.
13447	18	24	10	‡They go about naked, without clothing,‡and go hungry while they carry the sheaves.
13448	18	24	11	‡They press out the olive oil between the rows of olive trees; ‡they tread the winepresses while they are thirsty.
13449	18	24	12	‡From the city the dying groan,‡and the wounded cry out for help,‡but God charges no one with wrongdoing.
13450	18	24	13	‡There are those who rebel against the light;‡they do not know its ways ‡and they do not stay on its paths.
13451	18	24	14	‡Before daybreak the murderer rises up;‡he kills the poor and the needy;‡in the night he is like a thief.
13452	18	24	15	‡And the eye of the adulterer watches for the twilight,‡thinking, ‘No eye can see me,’‡and covers his face with a mask.
13453	18	24	16	‡In the dark the robber breaks into houses, ‡but by day they shut themselves in; ‡they do not know the light.
13454	18	24	17	‡For all of them, the morning is to them ‡like deep darkness;‡they are friends with the terrors of darkness.
13455	18	24	18	‡“You say, ‘He is foam on the face of the waters; ‡their portion of the land is cursed‡so that no one goes to their vineyard.
13456	18	24	19	‡The drought as well as the heat‡snatch up the melted snow; ‡so the grave snatches up the sinner.
13457	18	24	20	‡The womb forgets him, ‡the worm feasts on him,‡no longer will he be remembered.‡Like a tree, wickedness will be broken down.
13458	18	24	21	‡He preys on the barren and childless woman, ‡and does not treat the widow well.
13459	18	24	22	‡But God drags off the mighty by his power;‡when God rises up against him, he has no faith in his life.
13460	18	24	23	‡God may let them rest in a feeling of security, ‡but he is constantly watching all their ways.
13461	18	24	24	‡They are exalted for a little while,‡and then they are gone, ‡they are brought low like all others, ‡and gathered in, ‡and like a head of grain they are cut off.’
13462	18	24	25	‡“If this is not so, who can prove me a liar‡and reduce my words to nothing?”
13463	18	25	1	¶Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
13464	18	25	2	‡“Dominion and awesome might belong to God;‡he establishes peace in his heights.
13465	18	25	3	‡Can his armies be numbered? ‡On whom does his light not rise?
13466	18	25	4	‡How then can a human being be righteous before God?‡How can one born of a woman be pure?
13467	18	25	5	‡If even the moon is not bright,‡and the stars are not pure as far as he is concerned,
13468	18	25	6	‡how much less a mortal man, who is but a maggot – ‡a son of man, who is only a worm!”
13469	18	26	1	¶Then Job replied:
13470	18	26	2	‡“How you have helped the powerless! ‡How you have saved the person who has no strength!
13471	18	26	3	‡How you have advised the one without wisdom,‡and abundantly revealed your insight!
13472	18	26	4	‡To whom did you utter these words?‡And whose spirit has come forth from your mouth?
13473	18	26	5	‡“The dead tremble – ‡those beneath the waters ‡and all that live in them.
13474	18	26	6	‡The underworld is naked before God; ‡the place of destruction lies uncovered.
13475	18	26	7	‡He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; ‡he suspends the earth on nothing.
13476	18	26	8	‡He locks the waters in his clouds,‡and the clouds do not burst with the weight of them.
13477	18	26	9	‡He conceals the face of the full moon, ‡shrouding it with his clouds.
13478	18	26	10	‡He marks out the horizon on the surface of the waters‡as a boundary between light and darkness.
13479	18	26	11	‡The pillars of the heavens tremble‡and are amazed at his rebuke.
13480	18	26	12	‡By his power he stills the sea;‡by his wisdom he cut Rahab the great sea monster to pieces.
13481	18	26	13	‡By his breath the skies became fair;‡his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
13482	18	26	14	‡Indeed, these are but the outer fringes of his ways! ‡How faint is the whisper we hear of him!‡But who can understand the thunder of his power?”
13483	18	27	1	¶And Job took up his discourse again:
13484	18	27	2	‡“As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, ‡the Almighty, who has made my life bitter –
13485	18	27	3	‡for while my spirit is still in me,‡and the breath from God is in my nostrils,
13486	18	27	4	‡my lips will not speak wickedness,‡and my tongue will whisper no deceit.
13487	18	27	5	‡I will never declare that you three are in the right;‡until I die, I will not set aside my integrity!
13488	18	27	6	‡I will maintain my righteousness‡and never let it go;‡my conscience will not reproach me‡for as long as I live.
13489	18	27	7	‡“May my enemy be like the wicked, ‡my adversary like the unrighteous.
13490	18	27	8	‡For what hope does the godless have when he is cut off, ‡when God takes away his life?
13491	18	27	9	‡Does God listen to his cry‡when distress overtakes him?
13492	18	27	10	‡Will he find delight in the Almighty?‡Will he call out to God at all times?
13493	18	27	11	‡I will teach you about the power of God;‡What is on the Almighty’s mind I will not conceal.
13494	18	27	12	‡If you yourselves have all seen this,‡Why in the world do you continue this meaningless talk?
13495	18	27	13	‡This is the portion of the wicked man ‡allotted by God, ‡the inheritance that evildoers receive ‡from the Almighty.
13496	18	27	14	‡If his children increase – it is for the sword! ‡His offspring never have enough to eat.
13497	18	27	15	‡Those who survive him are buried by the plague, ‡and their widows do not mourn for them.
13498	18	27	16	‡If he piles up silver like dust‡and stores up clothing like mounds of clay,
13499	18	27	17	‡what he stores up a righteous man will wear,‡and an innocent man will inherit his silver.
13500	18	27	18	‡The house he builds is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon, ‡like a hut that a watchman has made.
13501	18	27	19	‡He goes to bed wealthy, but will do so no more. ‡When he opens his eyes, it is all gone.
13502	18	27	20	‡Terrors overwhelm him like a flood; ‡at night a whirlwind carries him off.
13503	18	27	21	‡The east wind carries him away, and he is gone;‡it sweeps him out of his place.
13504	18	27	22	‡It hurls itself against him without pity ‡as he flees headlong from its power.
13505	18	27	23	‡It claps its hands at him in derision‡and hisses him away from his place.
13506	18	28	1	‡“Surely there is a mine for silver,‡and a place where gold is refined.
13507	18	28	2	‡Iron is taken from the ground, ‡and rock is poured out as copper.
13508	18	28	3	‡Man puts an end to the darkness; ‡he searches the farthest recesses‡for the ore in the deepest darkness.
13509	18	28	4	‡Far from where people live he sinks a shaft,‡in places travelers have long forgotten, ‡far from other people he dangles and sways.
13510	18	28	5	‡The earth, from which food comes,‡is overturned below as though by fire;
13511	18	28	6	‡a place whose stones are sapphires ‡and which contains dust of gold;

13514	18	28	9	‡On the flinty rock man has set to work with his hand;‡he has overturned mountains at their bases.
13515	18	28	10	‡He has cut out channels through the rocks;‡his eyes have spotted every precious thing.
13516	18	28	11	‡He has searched the sources of the rivers‡and what was hidden he has brought into the light.
13517	18	28	12	‡“But wisdom – where can it be found?‡Where is the place of understanding?
13518	18	28	13	‡Mankind does not know its place; ‡it cannot be found in the land of the living.
13519	18	28	14	‡The deep says, ‘It is not with me.’‡And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’
13520	18	28	15	‡Fine gold cannot be given in exchange for it,‡nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
13521	18	28	16	‡It cannot be measured out for purchase with the gold of Ophir,‡with precious onyx or sapphires.
13522	18	28	17	‡Neither gold nor crystal can be compared with it,‡nor can a vase of gold match its worth.
13523	18	28	18	‡Of coral and jasper no mention will be made;‡the price of wisdom is more than pearls.
13524	18	28	19	‡The topaz of Cush cannot be compared with it;‡it cannot be purchased with pure gold.
13525	18	28	20	‡“But wisdom – where does it come from? ‡Where is the place of understanding?
13526	18	28	21	‡For it has been hidden ‡from the eyes of every living creature,‡and from the birds of the sky it has been concealed.
13527	18	28	22	‡Destruction and Death say,‡‘With our ears we have heard a rumor about where it can be found.’
13528	18	28	23	‡God understands the way to it,‡and he alone knows its place.
13529	18	28	24	‡For he looks to the ends of the earth‡and observes everything under the heavens.
13530	18	28	25	‡When he made the force of the wind‡and measured the waters with a gauge,
13531	18	28	26	‡when he imposed a limit for the rain,‡and a path for the thunderstorm,
13532	18	28	27	‡then he looked at wisdom and assessed its value; ‡he established it and examined it closely.
13533	18	28	28	‡And he said to mankind,‡‘The fear of the<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> – that is wisdom,‡and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”
13534	18	29	1	¶Then Job continued his speech:
13535	18	29	2	‡“O that I could be as I was ‡in the months now gone, ‡in the days when God watched over me,
13536	18	29	3	‡when he caused his lamp ‡to shine upon my head,‡and by his light ‡I walked through darkness;
13537	18	29	4	‡just as I was in my most productive time, ‡when God’s intimate friendship was experienced in my tent,
13538	18	29	5	‡when the Almighty was still with me‡and my children were around me;
13539	18	29	6	‡when my steps were bathed with butter ‡and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil!
13540	18	29	7	‡When I went out to the city gate‡and secured my seat in the public square,
13541	18	29	8	‡the young men would see me and step aside, ‡and the old men would get up and remain standing;
13542	18	29	9	‡the chief men refrained from talking‡and covered their mouths with their hands;
13543	18	29	10	‡the voices of the nobles fell silent, ‡and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
13544	18	29	11	‡“As soon as the ear heard these things, it blessed me, ‡and when the eye saw them, it bore witness to me,
13545	18	29	12	‡for I rescued the poor who cried out for help,‡and the orphan who had no one to assist him;
13546	18	29	13	‡the blessing of the dying man descended on me, ‡and I made the widow’s heart rejoice;
13547	18	29	14	‡I put on righteousness and it clothed me, ‡my just dealing was like a robe and a turban;
13548	18	29	15	‡I was eyes for the blind‡and feet for the lame;
13549	18	29	16	‡I was a father to the needy,‡and I investigated the case of the person I did not know;
13550	18	29	17	‡I broke the fangs of the wicked,‡and made him drop his prey from his teeth.
13551	18	29	18	‡“Then I thought, ‘I will die in my own home, ‡my days as numerous as the grains of sand.
13552	18	29	19	‡My roots reach the water,‡and the dew lies on my branches all night long.
13553	18	29	20	‡My glory will always be fresh in me,‡and my bow ever new in my hand.’
13554	18	29	21	‡“People listened to me and waited silently; ‡they kept silent for my advice.
13555	18	29	22	‡After I had spoken, they did not respond;‡my words fell on them drop by drop.
13556	18	29	23	‡They waited for me as people wait for the rain,‡and they opened their mouths as for the spring rains.
13557	18	29	24	‡If I smiled at them, they hardly believed it; ‡and they did not cause the light of my face to darken.
13558	18	29	25	‡I chose the way for them ‡and sat as their chief; ‡I lived like a king among his troops;‡I was like one who comforts mourners.
13559	18	30	1	‡“But now they mock me, those who are younger than I,‡whose fathers I disdained too much ‡to put with my sheep dogs.
13560	18	30	2	‡Moreover, the strength of their hands – ‡what use was it to me?‡Men whose strength had perished;
13561	18	30	3	‡gaunt with want and hunger,‡they would roam the parched land,‡by night a desolate waste.
13562	18	30	4	‡By the brush they would gather herbs from the salt marshes, ‡and the root of the broom tree was their food.
13563	18	30	5	‡They were banished from the community – ‡people shouted at them ‡like they would shout at thieves –
13564	18	30	6	‡so that they had to live ‡in the dry stream beds, ‡in the holes of the ground, and among the rocks.
13565	18	30	7	‡They brayed like animals among the bushes‡and were huddled together under the nettles.
13566	18	30	8	‡Sons of senseless and nameless people, ‡they were driven out of the land with whips.
13567	18	30	9	‡“And now I have become their taunt song;‡I have become a byword among them.
13568	18	30	10	‡They detest me and maintain their distance; ‡they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
13569	18	30	11	‡Because God has untied my tent cord and afflicted me,‡people throw off all restraint in my presence.
13570	18	30	12	‡On my right the young rabble rise up;‡they drive me from place to place, ‡and build up siege ramps against me.
13571	18	30	13	‡They destroy my path;‡they succeed in destroying me ‡without anyone assisting them.
13572	18	30	14	‡They come in as through a wide breach;‡amid the crash they come rolling in.
13573	18	30	15	‡Terrors are turned loose on me;‡they drive away my honor like the wind,‡and like a cloud my deliverance has passed away.
13574	18	30	16	‡“And now my soul pours itself out within me; ‡days of suffering take hold of me.
13575	18	30	17	‡Night pierces my bones; ‡my gnawing pains never cease.
13576	18	30	18	‡With great power God grasps my clothing; ‡he binds me like the collar of my tunic.
13577	18	30	19	‡He has flung me into the mud,‡and I have come to resemble dust and ashes.
13578	18	30	20	‡I cry out to you, but you do not answer me;‡I stand up, and you only look at me.
13579	18	30	21	‡You have become cruel to me; ‡with the strength of your hand you attack me.
13580	18	30	22	‡You pick me up on the wind and make me ride on it; ‡you toss me about in the storm.
13581	18	30	23	‡I know that you are bringing me to death,‡to the meeting place for all the living.
13582	18	30	24	‡“Surely one does not stretch out his hand ‡against a broken man ‡when he cries for help in his distress.
13583	18	30	25	‡Have I not wept for the unfortunate? ‡Was not my soul grieved for the poor?
13584	18	30	26	‡But when I hoped for good, trouble came;‡when I expected light, then darkness came.
13585	18	30	27	‡My heart is in turmoil unceasingly; ‡the days of my affliction confront me.
13586	18	30	28	‡I go about blackened, but not by the sun;‡in the assembly I stand up and cry for help.
13587	18	30	29	‡I have become a brother to jackals‡and a companion of ostriches.
13588	18	30	30	‡My skin has turned dark on me; ‡my body is hot with fever.
13589	18	30	31	‡My harp is used for mourning‡and my flute for the sound of weeping.
13590	18	31	1	‡“I made a covenant with my eyes;‡how then could I entertain thoughts against a virgin?
13591	18	31	2	‡What then would be one’s lot from God above,‡one’s heritage from the Almighty on high?
13592	18	31	3	‡Is it not misfortune for the unjust,‡and disaster for those who work iniquity?
13593	18	31	4	‡Does he not see my ways‡and count all my steps?
13594	18	31	5	‡If I have walked in falsehood,‡and if my foot has hastened to deceit –
13595	18	31	6	‡let him weigh me with honest scales;‡then God will discover my integrity.
13596	18	31	7	‡If my footsteps have strayed from the way,‡if my heart has gone after my eyes, ‡or if anything has defiled my hands,
13597	18	31	8	‡then let me sow and let another eat,‡and let my crops be uprooted.
13598	18	31	9	‡If my heart has been enticed by a woman,‡and I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door,
13599	18	31	10	‡then let my wife turn the millstone for another man,‡and may other men commit adultery with her.
13600	18	31	11	‡For I would have committed a shameful act, ‡an iniquity to be judged.
13601	18	31	12	‡For it is a fire that devours even to Destruction, ‡and it would uproot all my harvest.
13602	18	31	13	‡“If I have disregarded the right of my male servants ‡or my female servants‡when they disputed with me,
13603	18	31	14	‡then what will I do when God confronts me in judgment; ‡when he intervenes, ‡how will I respond to him?
13604	18	31	15	‡Did not the one who made me in the womb make them? ‡Did not the same one form us in the womb?
13605	18	31	16	‡If I have refused to give the poor what they desired, ‡or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
13606	18	31	17	‡If I ate my morsel of bread myself,‡and did not share any of it with orphans –
13607	18	31	18	‡but from my youth I raised the orphan like a father,‡and from my mother’s womb ‡I guided the widow!
13608	18	31	19	‡If I have seen anyone about to perish for lack of clothing,‡or a poor man without a coat,
13609	18	31	20	‡whose heart did not bless me ‡as he warmed himself with the fleece of my sheep,
13610	18	31	21	‡if I have raised my hand to vote against the orphan,‡when I saw my support in the court,
13611	18	31	22	‡then let my arm fall from the shoulder, ‡let my arm be broken off at the socket.
13612	18	31	23	‡For the calamity from God was a terror to me, ‡and by reason of his majesty I was powerless.
13613	18	31	24	‡“If I have put my confidence in gold‡or said to pure gold, ‡‘You are my security!’
13614	18	31	25	‡if I have rejoiced because of the extent of my wealth,‡or because of the great wealth my hand had gained,
13615	18	31	26	‡if I looked at the sun when it was shining,‡and the moon advancing as a precious thing,
13616	18	31	27	‡so that my heart was secretly enticed,‡and my hand threw them a kiss from my mouth,
13617	18	31	28	‡then this also would be iniquity to be judged, ‡for I would have been false to God above.
13618	18	31	29	‡If I have rejoiced over the misfortune of my enemy ‡or exulted because calamity found him –
13619	18	31	30	‡I have not even permitted my mouth to sin‡by asking for his life through a curse –
13620	18	31	31	‡if the members of my household have never said, ‡‘If only there were someone ‡who has not been satisfied from Job’s meat!’ –
13621	18	31	32	‡But no stranger had to spend the night outside,‡for I opened my doors to the traveler –
13622	18	31	33	‡if I have covered my transgressions as men do, ‡by hiding iniquity in my heart,
13623	18	31	34	‡because I was terrified of the great multitude, ‡and the contempt of families terrified me,‡so that I remained silent‡and would not go outdoors –
13624	18	31	35	‡“If only I had someone to hear me!‡Here is my signature – ‡let the Almighty answer me!‡If only I had an indictment ‡that my accuser had written.
13625	18	31	36	‡Surely I would wear it proudly on my shoulder,‡I would bind it on me like a crown;
13626	18	31	37	‡I would give him an accounting of my steps;‡like a prince I would approach him.
13627	18	31	38	‡“If my land cried out against me ‡and all its furrows wept together,
13628	18	31	39	‡if I have eaten its produce without paying, ‡or caused the death of its owners,
13629	18	31	40	‡then let thorns sprout up in place of wheat,‡and in place of barley, weeds!” ¶The words of Job are ended.
13630	18	32	1	¶So these three men refused to answer Job further, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
13631	18	32	2	Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry. He was angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.
13632	18	32	3	With Job’s three friends he was also angry, because they could not find an answer, and so declared Job guilty.
13633	18	32	4	Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job, because the others were older than he was.
13634	18	32	5	But when Elihu saw that the three men had no further reply, he became very angry.
13635	18	32	6	¶So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite spoke up: ‡“I am young, but you are elderly;‡that is why I was fearful, ‡and afraid to explain to you what I know.
13636	18	32	7	‡I said to myself, ‘Age should speak, ‡and length of years should make wisdom known.’
13637	18	32	8	‡But it is a spirit in people,‡the breath of the Almighty,‡that makes them understand.
13638	18	32	9	‡It is not the aged who are wise,‡nor old men who understand what is right.
13639	18	32	10	‡Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me.‡I, even I, will explain what I know.’
13640	18	32	11	‡Look, I waited for you to speak; ‡I listened closely to your wise thoughts, while you were searching for words.
13641	18	32	12	‡Now I was paying you close attention, ‡yet there was no one proving Job wrong, ‡not one of you was answering his statements!
13642	18	32	13	‡So do not say, ‘We have found wisdom!‡God will refute him, not man!’
13643	18	32	14	‡Job has not directed his words to me,‡and so I will not reply to him with your arguments.
13644	18	32	15	‡“They are dismayed and cannot answer any more;‡they have nothing left to say.
13645	18	32	16	‡And I have waited. But because they do not speak,‡because they stand there and answer no more,
13646	18	32	17	‡I too will answer my part,‡I too will explain what I know.
13647	18	32	18	‡For I am full of words,‡and the spirit within me constrains me.
13648	18	32	19	‡Inside I am like wine which has no outlet, ‡like new wineskins ready to burst!
13649	18	32	20	‡I will speak, so that I may find relief;‡I will open my lips, so that I may answer.
13650	18	32	21	‡I will not show partiality to anyone, ‡nor will I confer a title on any man.
13651	18	32	22	‡for I do not know how to give honorary titles, ‡if I did, my Creator would quickly do away with me.
13652	18	33	1	‡“But now, O Job, listen to my words,‡and hear everything I have to say!
13653	18	33	2	‡See now, I have opened my mouth;‡my tongue in my mouth has spoken.
13654	18	33	3	‡My words come from the uprightness of my heart, ‡and my lips will utter knowledge sincerely.
13655	18	33	4	‡The Spirit of God has made me,‡and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
13656	18	33	5	‡Reply to me, if you can;‡set your arguments in order before me‡and take your stand!
13657	18	33	6	‡Look, I am just like you in relation to God;‡I too have been molded from clay.
13658	18	33	7	‡Therefore no fear of me should terrify you,‡nor should my pressure be heavy on you.
13659	18	33	8	‡“Indeed, you have said in my hearing ‡(I heard the sound of the words!):
13660	18	33	9	‡‘I am pure, without transgression;‡I am clean and have no iniquity.
13661	18	33	10	‡Yet God finds occasions with me;‡he regards me as his enemy!
13662	18	33	11	‡He puts my feet in shackles;‡he watches closely all my paths.’
13663	18	33	12	‡Now in this, you are not right – I answer you, ‡for God is greater than a human being.
13664	18	33	13	‡Why do you contend against him,‡that he does not answer all a person’s words?
13665	18	33	14	‡“For God speaks, the first time in one way,‡the second time in another, ‡though a person does not perceive it.
13666	18	33	15	‡In a dream, a night vision,‡when deep sleep falls on people‡as they sleep in their beds.
13667	18	33	16	‡Then he gives a revelation to people,‡and terrifies them with warnings,
13668	18	33	17	‡to turn a person from his sin, ‡and to cover a person’s pride.
13669	18	33	18	‡He spares a person’s life from corruption, ‡his very life from crossing over the river.
13670	18	33	19	‡Or a person is chastened by pain on his bed,‡and with the continual strife of his bones,
13671	18	33	20	‡so that his life loathes food,‡and his soul rejects appetizing fare.
13672	18	33	21	‡His flesh wastes away from sight,‡and his bones, which were not seen, ‡are easily visible.
13673	18	33	22	‡He draws near to the place of corruption,‡and his life to the messengers of death.
13674	18	33	23	‡If there is an angel beside him,‡one mediator out of a thousand,‡to tell a person what constitutes his uprightness;
13675	18	33	24	‡and if God is gracious to him and says,‡‘Spare him from going down ‡to the place of corruption,‡I have found a ransom for him,’
13676	18	33	25	‡then his flesh is restored like a youth’s;‡he returns to the days of his youthful vigor.
13677	18	33	26	‡He entreats God, and God delights in him,‡he sees God’s face with rejoicing,‡and God restores to him his righteousness.
13678	18	33	27	‡That person sings to others, saying:‡‘I have sinned and falsified what is right,‡but I was not punished according to what I deserved.
13679	18	33	28	‡He redeemed my life ‡from going down to the place of corruption,‡and my life sees the light!’
13680	18	33	29	‡“Indeed, God does all these things,‡twice, three times, in his dealings with a person,
13681	18	33	30	‡to turn back his life from the place of corruption,‡that he may be enlightened with the light of life.
13682	18	33	31	‡Pay attention, Job – listen to me;‡be silent, and I will speak.
13683	18	33	32	‡If you have any words, reply to me;‡speak, for I want to justify you.
13684	18	33	33	‡If not, you listen to me;‡be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
13685	18	34	1	¶Elihu answered:
13686	18	34	2	‡“Listen to my words, you wise men;‡hear me, you learned men.
13687	18	34	3	‡For the ear assesses words‡as the mouth tastes food.
13688	18	34	4	‡Let us evaluate for ourselves what is right; ‡let us come to know among ourselves what is good.
13689	18	34	5	‡For Job says, ‘I am innocent, ‡but God turns away my right.
13690	18	34	6	‡Concerning my right, should I lie? ‡My wound is incurable,‡although I am without transgression.’
13691	18	34	7	‡What man is like Job,‡who drinks derision like water!
13692	18	34	8	‡He goes about in company with evildoers,‡he goes along with wicked men.
13693	18	34	9	‡For he says, ‘It does not profit a man‡when he makes his delight with God.’
13694	18	34	10	‡“Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding. ‡Far be it from God to do wickedness,‡from the Almighty to do evil.
13695	18	34	11	‡For he repays a person for his work, ‡and according to the conduct of a person,‡he causes the consequences to find him.
13696	18	34	12	‡Indeed, in truth, God does not act wickedly,‡and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
13697	18	34	13	‡Who entrusted to him the earth?‡And who put him over the whole world?
13698	18	34	14	‡If God were to set his heart on it, ‡and gather in his spirit and his breath,
13699	18	34	15	‡all flesh would perish together‡and human beings would return to dust.
13700	18	34	16	‡“If you have understanding, listen to this,‡hear what I have to say.
13701	18	34	17	‡Do you really think ‡that one who hates justice can govern? ‡And will you declare guilty ‡the supremely Righteous One,
13702	18	34	18	‡who says to a king, ‘Worthless man’ ‡and to nobles, ‘Wicked men,’
13703	18	34	19	‡who shows no partiality to princes,‡and does not take note of the rich more than the poor,‡because all of them are the work of his hands?
13704	18	34	20	‡In a moment they die, in the middle of the night, ‡people are shaken and they pass away.‡The mighty are removed effortlessly.
13705	18	34	21	‡For his eyes are on the ways of an individual,‡he observes all a person’s steps.
13706	18	34	22	‡There is no darkness, and no deep darkness,‡where evildoers can hide themselves.
13707	18	34	23	‡For he does not still consider a person, ‡that he should come before God in judgment.
13708	18	34	24	‡He shatters the great without inquiry, ‡and sets up others in their place.
13709	18	34	25	‡Therefore, he knows their deeds,‡he overthrows them in the night ‡and they are crushed.
13710	18	34	26	‡He strikes them for their wickedness, ‡in a place where people can see,
13711	18	34	27	‡because they have turned away from following him,‡and have not understood any of his ways,
13712	18	34	28	‡so that they caused the cry of the poor‡to come before him,‡so that he hears the cry of the needy.
13713	18	34	29	‡But if God is quiet, who can condemn him?‡If he hides his face, then who can see him?‡Yet he is over the individual and the nation alike,
13714	18	34	30	‡so that the godless man should not rule,‡and not lay snares for the people.
13715	18	34	31	‡“Has anyone said to God,‡‘I have endured chastisement, ‡but I will not act wrongly any more.
13716	18	34	32	‡Teach me what I cannot see. ‡If I have done evil, I will do so no more.’
13717	18	34	33	‡Is it your opinion that God should recompense it,‡because you reject this? ‡But you must choose, and not I,‡so tell us what you know.
13718	18	34	34	‡Men of understanding say to me – ‡any wise man listening to me says –
13719	18	34	35	‡that Job speaks without knowledge‡and his words are without understanding.
13720	18	34	36	‡But Job will be tested to the end,‡because his answers are like those of wicked men.
13721	18	34	37	‡For he adds transgression to his sin;‡in our midst he claps his hands, ‡and multiplies his words against God.”
13722	18	35	1	¶Then Elihu answered:
13723	18	35	2	‡“Do you think this to be just:‡when you say, ‘My right before God.’
13724	18	35	3	‡But you say, ‘What will it profit you,’ ‡and, ‘What do I gain by not sinning?’
13725	18	35	4	‡I will reply to you, ‡and to your friends with you.
13726	18	35	5	‡Gaze at the heavens and see;‡consider the clouds, which are higher than you!
13727	18	35	6	‡If you sin, how does it affect God? ‡If your transgressions are many,‡what does it do to him?
13728	18	35	7	‡If you are righteous, what do you give to God,‡or what does he receive from your hand?
13729	18	35	8	‡Your wickedness affects only a person like yourself,‡and your righteousness only other people.
13730	18	35	9	‡“People cry out ‡because of the excess of oppression; ‡they cry out for help‡because of the power of the mighty.
13731	18	35	10	‡But no one says, ‘Where is God, my Creator,‡who gives songs in the night,
13732	18	35	11	‡who teaches us more than the wild animals of the earth,‡and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’
13733	18	35	12	‡Then they cry out – but he does not answer – ‡because of the arrogance of the wicked.
13734	18	35	13	‡Surely it is an empty cry – God does not hear it;‡the Almighty does not take notice of it.
13735	18	35	14	‡How much less, then,‡when you say that you do not perceive him,‡that the case is before him ‡and you are waiting for him!
13736	18	35	15	‡And further, when you say‡that his anger does not punish, ‡and that he does not know transgression!
13737	18	35	16	‡So Job opens his mouth to no purpose; ‡without knowledge he multiplies words.”
13738	18	36	1	¶Elihu said further:
13739	18	36	2	‡“Be patient with me a little longer‡and I will instruct you,‡for I still have words to speak on God’s behalf.
13740	18	36	3	‡With my knowledge I will speak comprehensively, ‡and to my Creator I will ascribe righteousness.
13741	18	36	4	‡For in truth, my words are not false;‡it is one complete in knowledge ‡who is with you.
13742	18	36	5	‡Indeed, God is mighty; and he does not despise people, ‡he is mighty, and firm in his intent.
13743	18	36	6	‡He does not allow the wicked to live, ‡but he gives justice to the poor.
13744	18	36	7	‡He does not take his eyes off the righteous;‡but with kings on the throne ‡he seats the righteous and exalts them forever.
13745	18	36	8	‡But if they are bound in chains, ‡and held captive by the cords of affliction,
13746	18	36	9	‡then he reveals to them what they have done, ‡and their transgressions, ‡that they were behaving proudly.
13747	18	36	10	‡And he reveals this for correction,‡and says that they must turn from evil.
13748	18	36	11	‡If they obey and serve him,‡they live out their days in prosperity‡and their years in pleasantness.
13749	18	36	12	‡But if they refuse to listen,‡they pass over the river of death, ‡and expire without knowledge.
13750	18	36	13	‡The godless at heart nourish anger, ‡they do not cry out even when he binds them.
13751	18	36	14	‡They die in their youth,‡and their life ends among the male cultic prostitutes.
13752	18	36	15	‡He delivers the afflicted by their afflictions,‡he reveals himself to them by their suffering.
13753	18	36	16	‡And surely, he drew you from the mouth of distress,‡to a wide place, unrestricted, ‡and to the comfort of your table‡filled with rich food.
13754	18	36	17	‡But now you are preoccupied with the judgment due the wicked,‡judgment and justice take hold of you.
13755	18	36	18	‡Be careful that no one entices you with riches;‡do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
13756	18	36	19	‡Would your wealth sustain you,‡so that you would not be in distress, ‡even all your mighty efforts?
13757	18	36	20	‡Do not long for the cover of night‡to drag people away from their homes.
13758	18	36	21	‡Take heed, do not turn to evil,‡for because of this you have been tested by affliction.
13759	18	36	22	‡Indeed, God is exalted in his power;‡who is a teacher like him?
13760	18	36	23	‡Who has prescribed his ways for him?‡Or said to him, ‘You have done what is wicked’?
13761	18	36	24	‡Remember to extol his work,‡which people have praised in song.
13762	18	36	25	‡All humanity has seen it;‡people gaze on it from afar.
13763	18	36	26	‡“Yes, God is great – beyond our knowledge! ‡The number of his years is unsearchable.
13764	18	36	27	‡He draws up drops of water;‡they distill the rain into its mist,
13765	18	36	28	‡which the clouds pour down‡and shower on humankind abundantly.
13766	18	36	29	‡Who can understand the spreading of the clouds,‡the thunderings of his pavilion?
13767	18	36	30	‡See how he scattered his lightning about him;‡he has covered the depths of the sea.
13768	18	36	31	‡It is by these that he judges the nations‡and supplies food in abundance.
13769	18	36	32	‡With his hands he covers the lightning,‡and directs it against its target.
13770	18	36	33	‡His thunder announces the coming storm,‡the cattle also, concerning the storm’s approach.
13771	18	37	1	‡At this also my heart pounds‡and leaps from its place.
13772	18	37	2	‡Listen carefully to the thunder of his voice,‡to the rumbling that proceeds from his mouth.
13773	18	37	3	‡Under the whole heaven he lets it go,‡even his lightning to the far corners of the earth.
13774	18	37	4	‡After that a voice roars;‡he thunders with an exalted voice,‡and he does not hold back his lightning bolts ‡when his voice is heard.
13775	18	37	5	‡God thunders with his voice in marvelous ways; ‡he does great things beyond our understanding.
13776	18	37	6	‡For to the snow he says, ‘Fall to earth,’‡and to the torrential rains, ‘Pour down.’
13777	18	37	7	‡He causes everyone to stop working, ‡so that all people may know his work.
13778	18	37	8	‡The wild animals go to their lairs,‡and in their dens they remain.
13779	18	37	9	‡A tempest blows out from its chamber,‡icy cold from the driving winds.
13780	18	37	10	‡The breath of God produces ice,‡and the breadth of the waters freeze solid.
13781	18	37	11	‡He loads the clouds with moisture; ‡he scatters his lightning through the clouds.
13782	18	37	12	‡The clouds go round in circles,‡wheeling about according to his plans,‡to carry out all that he commands them‡over the face of the whole inhabited world.
13783	18	37	13	‡Whether it is for punishment, ‡or for his land,‡or for mercy, ‡he causes it to find its mark.
13784	18	37	14	‡“Pay attention to this, Job!‡Stand still and consider the wonders God works.
13785	18	37	15	‡Do you know how God commands them, ‡how he makes lightning flash in his storm cloud?
13786	18	37	16	‡Do you know about the balancing of the clouds,‡that wondrous activity of him who is perfect in knowledge?
13787	18	37	17	‡You, whose garments are hot‡when the earth is still because of the south wind,
13788	18	37	18	‡will you, with him, spread out the clouds,‡solid as a mirror of molten metal?
13789	18	37	19	‡Tell us what we should say to him.‡We cannot prepare a case ‡because of the darkness.
13790	18	37	20	‡Should he be informed that I want to speak?‡If a man speaks, surely he will be swallowed up!
13791	18	37	21	‡But now, the sun cannot be looked at – ‡it is bright in the skies – ‡after a wind passed and swept the clouds away.
13792	18	37	22	‡From the north he comes in golden splendor; ‡around God is awesome majesty.
13793	18	37	23	‡As for the Almighty, we cannot attain to him!‡He is great in power,‡but justice and abundant righteousness he does not oppress.
13794	18	37	24	‡Therefore people fear him,‡for he does not regard all the wise in heart.”
13795	18	38	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answered Job out of the whirlwind:
13796	18	38	2	‡“Who is this who darkens counsel ‡with words without knowledge?
13797	18	38	3	‡Get ready for a difficult task like a man;‡I will question you‡and you will inform me!
13798	18	38	4	‡“Where were you ‡when I laid the foundation of the earth?‡Tell me, if you possess understanding!
13799	18	38	5	‡Who set its measurements – if you know – ‡or who stretched a measuring line across it?
13800	18	38	6	‡On what were its bases set,‡or who laid its cornerstone –
13801	18	38	7	‡when the morning stars sang in chorus, ‡and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
13802	18	38	8	‡“Who shut up the sea with doors‡when it burst forth, coming out of the womb,
13803	18	38	9	‡when I made the storm clouds its garment,‡and thick darkness its swaddling band,
13804	18	38	10	‡when I prescribed its limits,‡and set in place its bolts and doors,
13805	18	38	11	‡when I said, ‘To here you may come ‡and no farther, ‡here your proud waves will be confined’?
13806	18	38	12	‡Have you ever in your life commanded the morning,‡or made the dawn know its place,
13807	18	38	13	‡that it might seize the corners of the earth, ‡and shake the wicked out of it?
13808	18	38	14	‡The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; ‡its features are dyed like a garment.
13809	18	38	15	‡Then from the wicked the light is withheld,‡and the arm raised in violence is broken.

13855	18	39	20	‡Do you make it leap like a locust?‡Its proud neighing is terrifying!
13856	18	39	21	‡It paws the ground in the valley, ‡exulting mightily, ‡it goes out to meet the weapons.
13857	18	39	22	‡It laughs at fear and is not dismayed;‡it does not shy away from the sword.
13858	18	39	23	‡On it the quiver rattles;‡the lance and javelin flash.
13859	18	39	24	‡In excitement and impatience it consumes the ground; ‡it cannot stand still when the trumpet is blown.
13860	18	39	25	‡At the sound of the trumpet, it says, ‘Aha!’‡And from a distance it catches the scent of battle,‡the thunderous shouting of commanders, ‡and the battle cries.
13861	18	39	26	‡“Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, ‡and spreads its wings toward the south?
13862	18	39	27	‡Is it at your command that the eagle soars,‡and builds its nest on high?
13863	18	39	28	‡It lives on a rock and spends the night there,‡on a rocky crag and a fortress.
13864	18	39	29	‡From there it spots its prey, ‡its eyes gaze intently from a distance.
13865	18	39	30	‡And its young ones devour the blood,‡and where the dead carcasses are, ‡there it is.”
13866	18	40	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answered Job:
13867	18	40	2	‡“Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? ‡Let the person who accuses God give him an answer!”
13868	18	40	3	‡Then Job answered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>:
13869	18	40	4	‡“Indeed, I am completely unworthy – how could I reply to you?‡I put my hand over my mouth to silence myself.
13870	18	40	5	‡I have spoken once, but I cannot answer;‡twice, but I will say no more.”
13871	18	40	6	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answered Job from the whirlwind:
13872	18	40	7	‡“Get ready for a difficult task like a man. ‡I will question you and you will inform me!
13873	18	40	8	‡Would you indeed annul my justice?‡Would you declare me guilty so that you might be right?
13874	18	40	9	‡Do you have an arm as powerful as God’s, ‡and can you thunder with a voice like his?
13875	18	40	10	‡Adorn yourself, then, with majesty and excellency,‡and clothe yourself with glory and honor!
13876	18	40	11	‡Scatter abroad the abundance of your anger.‡Look at every proud man and bring him low;
13877	18	40	12	‡Look at every proud man and abase him;‡crush the wicked on the spot!
13878	18	40	13	‡Hide them in the dust together,‡imprison them in the grave.
13879	18	40	14	‡Then I myself will acknowledge to you‡that your own right hand can save you.
13880	18	40	15	‡“Look now at Behemoth, which I made as I made you;‡it eats grass like the ox.
13881	18	40	16	‡Look at its strength in its loins,‡and its power in the muscles of its belly.
13882	18	40	17	‡It makes its tail stiff like a cedar,‡the sinews of its thighs are tightly wound.
13883	18	40	18	‡Its bones are tubes of bronze,‡its limbs like bars of iron.
13884	18	40	19	‡It ranks first among the works of God, ‡the One who made it ‡has furnished it with a sword.
13885	18	40	20	‡For the hills bring it food, ‡where all the wild animals play.
13886	18	40	21	‡Under the lotus trees it lies,‡in the secrecy of the reeds and the marsh.
13887	18	40	22	‡The lotus trees conceal it in their shadow;‡the poplars by the stream conceal it.
13888	18	40	23	‡If the river rages, it is not disturbed,‡it is secure, though the Jordan ‡should surge up to its mouth.
13889	18	40	24	‡Can anyone catch it by its eyes, ‡or pierce its nose with a snare?
13890	18	41	1	‡(40:25) “Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook,‡and tie down its tongue with a rope?
13891	18	41	2	‡Can you put a cord through its nose,‡or pierce its jaw with a hook?
13892	18	41	3	‡Will it make numerous supplications to you, ‡will it speak to you with tender words?
13893	18	41	4	‡Will it make a pact with you,‡so you could take it as your slave for life?
13894	18	41	5	‡Can you play with it, like a bird,‡or tie it on a leash for your girls?
13895	18	41	6	‡Will partners bargain for it?‡Will they divide it up among the merchants?
13896	18	41	7	‡Can you fill its hide with harpoons‡or its head with fishing spears?
13897	18	41	8	‡If you lay your hand on it,‡you will remember the fight. ‡Do not do it again!
13898	18	41	9	‡(41:1) See, his expectation is wrong, ‡he is laid low even at the sight of it.
13899	18	41	10	‡Is it not fierce when it is awakened?‡Who is he, then, who can stand before it?
13900	18	41	11	‡(Who has confronted me that I should repay? ‡Everything under heaven belongs to me!)
13901	18	41	12	‡I will not keep silent about its limbs,‡and the extent of its might, ‡and the grace of its arrangement.
13902	18	41	13	‡Who can uncover its outer covering? ‡Who can penetrate to the inside of its armor?
13903	18	41	14	‡Who can open the doors of its mouth? ‡Its teeth all around are fearsome.
13904	18	41	15	‡Its back has rows of shields,‡shut up closely together as with a seal;
13905	18	41	16	‡each one is so close to the next ‡that no air can come between them.
13906	18	41	17	‡They lock tightly together, one to the next; ‡they cling together and cannot be separated.
13907	18	41	18	‡Its snorting throws out flashes of light;‡its eyes are like the red glow of dawn.
13908	18	41	19	‡Out of its mouth go flames, ‡sparks of fire shoot forth!
13909	18	41	20	‡Smoke streams from its nostrils‡as from a boiling pot over burning rushes.
13910	18	41	21	‡Its breath sets coals ablaze‡and a flame shoots from its mouth.
13911	18	41	22	‡Strength lodges in its neck,‡and despair runs before it.
13912	18	41	23	‡The folds of its flesh are tightly joined;‡they are firm on it, immovable.
13913	18	41	24	‡Its heart is hard as rock,‡hard as a lower millstone.
13914	18	41	25	‡When it rises up, the mighty are terrified,‡at its thrashing about they withdraw.
13915	18	41	26	‡Whoever strikes it with a sword ‡will have no effect, ‡nor with the spear, arrow, or dart.
13916	18	41	27	‡It regards iron as straw‡and bronze as rotten wood.
13917	18	41	28	‡Arrows do not make it flee;‡slingstones become like chaff to it.
13918	18	41	29	‡A club is counted as a piece of straw;‡it laughs at the rattling of the lance.
13919	18	41	30	‡Its underparts are the sharp points of potsherds,‡it leaves its mark in the mud ‡like a threshing sledge.
13920	18	41	31	‡It makes the deep boil like a cauldron‡and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment,
13921	18	41	32	‡It leaves a glistening wake behind it;‡one would think the deep had a head of white hair.
13922	18	41	33	‡The likes of it is not on earth,‡a creature without fear.
13923	18	41	34	‡It looks on every haughty being;‡it is king over all that are proud.”
13924	18	42	1	¶Then Job answered the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>:
13925	18	42	2	‡“I know that you can do all things;‡no purpose of yours can be thwarted;
13926	18	42	3	‡you asked, ‡‘Who is this who darkens counsel ‡without knowledge?’‡But I have declared without understanding ‡things too wonderful for me to know.
13927	18	42	4	‡You said, ‡‘Pay attention, and I will speak;‡I will question you, and you will answer me.’
13928	18	42	5	‡I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,‡but now my eye has seen you.
13929	18	42	6	‡Therefore I despise myself, ‡and I repent in dust and ashes!
13930	18	42	7	¶After the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had spoken these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My anger is stirred up against you and your two friends, because you have not spoken about me what is right, as my servant Job has.
13931	18	42	8	So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job will intercede for you, and I will respect him, so that I do not deal with you according to your folly, because you have not spoken about me what is right, as my servant Job has.”
13932	18	42	9	¶So they went, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and did just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had told them; and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had respect for Job.
13933	18	42	10	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> restored what Job had lost after he prayed for his friends, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> doubled all that had belonged to Job.
13934	18	42	11	So they came to him, all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they dined with him in his house. They comforted him and consoled him for all the trouble the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had brought on him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.
13935	18	42	12	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> blessed the second part of Job’s life more than the first. He had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
13936	18	42	13	And he also had seven sons and three daughters.
13937	18	42	14	The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-Happuch.
13938	18	42	15	Nowhere in all the land could women be found who were as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance alongside their brothers.
13939	18	42	16	¶After this Job lived 140 years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.
13940	18	42	17	And so Job died, old and full of days.
13941	19	1	1	‡How blessed is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked, ‡or stand in the pathway with sinners,‡or sit in the assembly of scoffers!
13942	19	1	2	‡Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s commands; ‡he meditates on his commands day and night.
13943	19	1	3	‡He is like a tree planted by flowing streams; ‡it yields its fruit at the proper time, ‡and its leaves never fall off. ‡He succeeds in everything he attempts.
13944	19	1	4	‡Not so with the wicked!‡Instead they are like wind-driven chaff.
13945	19	1	5	‡For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment, ‡nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.
13946	19	1	6	‡Certainly the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> guards the way of the godly, ‡but the way of the wicked ends in destruction.
13947	19	2	1	‡Why do the nations rebel? ‡Why are the countries devising plots that will fail?
13948	19	2	2	‡The kings of the earth form a united front; ‡the rulers collaborate ‡against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and his anointed king.
13949	19	2	3	‡They say, “Let’s tear off the shackles they’ve put on us! ‡Let’s free ourselves from their ropes!”
13950	19	2	4	‡The one enthroned in heaven laughs in disgust; ‡the Lord taunts them.
13951	19	2	5	‡Then he angrily speaks to them‡and terrifies them in his rage, saying,
13952	19	2	6	‡“I myself have installed my king‡on Zion, my holy hill.”
13953	19	2	7	‡The king says, “I will announce the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s decree. He said to me: ‡‘You are my son! This very day I have become your father!
13954	19	2	8	‡Ask me,‡and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, ‡the ends of the earth as your personal property.
13955	19	2	9	‡You will break them with an iron scepter; ‡you will smash them like a potter’s jar!’”
13956	19	2	10	‡So now, you kings, do what is wise; ‡you rulers of the earth, submit to correction!
13957	19	2	11	‡Serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in fear!‡Repent in terror!
13958	19	2	12	‡Give sincere homage! ‡Otherwise he will be angry, ‡and you will die because of your behavior, ‡when his anger quickly ignites. ‡How blessed are all who take shelter in him!

13963	19	3	5	‡I rested and slept;‡I awoke, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> protects me.

13967	19	4	1	¶For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of David.†When I call out, answer me,‡O God who vindicates me! ‡Though I am hemmed in, you will lead me into a wide, open place. ‡Have mercy on me and respond to my prayer!
13968	19	4	2	‡You men, how long will you try to turn my honor into shame? ‡How long will you love what is worthless ‡and search for what is deceptive? (Selah)
13969	19	4	3	‡Realize that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> shows the godly special favor; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responds when I cry out to him.
13970	19	4	4	‡Tremble with fear and do not sin! ‡Meditate as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways! (Selah)
13971	19	4	5	‡Offer the prescribed sacrifices ‡and trust in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!

13974	19	4	8	‡I will lie down and sleep peacefully, ‡for you, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, make me safe and secure.
13975	19	5	1	¶For the music director, to be accompanied by wind instruments; a psalm of David.†Listen to what I say, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!‡Carefully consider my complaint!
13976	19	5	2	‡Pay attention to my cry for help,‡my king and my God,‡for I am praying to you!
13977	19	5	3	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, in the morning you will hear me; ‡in the morning I will present my case to you and then wait expectantly for an answer.
13978	19	5	4	‡Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil; ‡evil people cannot dwell with you.
13979	19	5	5	‡Arrogant people cannot stand in your presence; ‡you hate all who behave wickedly.
13980	19	5	6	‡You destroy liars; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> despises violent and deceitful people.
13981	19	5	7	‡But as for me, because of your great faithfulness I will enter your house; ‡I will bow down toward your holy temple as I worship you.
13982	19	5	8	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, lead me in your righteousness ‡because of those who wait to ambush me, ‡remove the obstacles in the way in which you are guiding me!
13983	19	5	9	‡For they do not speak the truth; ‡their stomachs are like the place of destruction, ‡their throats like an open grave, ‡their tongues like a steep slope leading into it.

13986	19	5	12	‡Certainly you reward the godly, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡Like a shield you protect them in your good favor.
13987	19	6	1	¶For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments, according to the <i>sheminith</i> style; a psalm of David.†<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, do not rebuke me in your anger!‡Do not discipline me in your raging fury!

15023	19	73	2	‡But as for me, my feet almost slipped;‡my feet almost slid out from under me.
15024	19	73	3	‡For I envied those who are proud,‡as I observed the prosperity of the wicked.
15025	19	73	4	‡For they suffer no pain; ‡their bodies are strong and well-fed.
15026	19	73	5	‡They are immune to the trouble common to men;‡they do not suffer as other men do.
15027	19	73	6	‡Arrogance is their necklace, ‡and violence covers them like clothing.
15028	19	73	7	‡Their prosperity causes them to do wrong; ‡their thoughts are sinful.
15029	19	73	8	‡They mock and say evil things; ‡they proudly threaten violence.
15030	19	73	9	‡They speak as if they rule in heaven,‡and lay claim to the earth.
15031	19	73	10	‡Therefore they have more than enough food to eat,‡and even suck up the water of the sea.
15032	19	73	11	‡They say, “How does God know what we do?‡Is the Most High aware of what goes on?”
15033	19	73	12	‡Take a good look! This is what the wicked are like, ‡those who always have it so easy and get richer and richer.
15034	19	73	13	‡I concluded, “Surely in vain I have kept my motives pure‡and maintained a pure lifestyle.
15035	19	73	14	‡I suffer all day long,‡and am punished every morning.”
15036	19	73	15	‡If I had publicized these thoughts, ‡I would have betrayed your people.
15037	19	73	16	‡When I tried to make sense of this,‡it was troubling to me.
15038	19	73	17	‡Then I entered the precincts of God’s temple, ‡and understood the destiny of the wicked.
15039	19	73	18	‡Surely you put them in slippery places;‡you bring them down to ruin.
15040	19	73	19	‡How desolate they become in a mere moment!‡Terrifying judgments make their demise complete!
15041	19	73	20	‡They are like a dream after one wakes up. ‡O Lord, when you awake you will despise them.
15042	19	73	21	‡Yes, my spirit was bitter, ‡and my insides felt sharp pain.
15043	19	73	22	‡I was ignorant and lacked insight; ‡I was as senseless as an animal before you.
15044	19	73	23	‡But I am continually with you;‡you hold my right hand.
15045	19	73	24	‡You guide me by your wise advice,‡and then you will lead me to a position of honor.

15048	19	73	27	‡Yes, look! Those far from you die;‡you destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you.
15049	19	73	28	‡But as for me, God’s presence is all I need. ‡I have made the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my shelter,‡as I declare all the things you have done.
15050	19	74	1	¶A well-written song by Asaph.†Why, O God, have you permanently rejected us? ‡Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?
15051	19	74	2	‡Remember your people whom you acquired in ancient times,‡whom you rescued so they could be your very own nation, ‡as well as Mount Zion, where you dwell!
15052	19	74	3	‡Hurry to the permanent ruins,‡and to all the damage the enemy has done to the temple!
15053	19	74	4	‡Your enemies roar in the middle of your sanctuary; ‡they set up their battle flags.
15054	19	74	5	‡They invade like lumberjacks‡swinging their axes in a thick forest.
15055	19	74	6	‡And now they are tearing down all its engravings ‡with axes and crowbars.
15056	19	74	7	‡They set your sanctuary on fire;‡they desecrate your dwelling place by knocking it to the ground.
15057	19	74	8	‡They say to themselves, ‡“We will oppress all of them.” ‡They burn down all the places where people worship God in the land.
15058	19	74	9	‡We do not see any signs of God’s presence; ‡there are no longer any prophets ‡and we have no one to tell us how long this will last.
15059	19	74	10	‡How long, O God, will the adversary hurl insults?‡Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
15060	19	74	11	‡Why do you remain inactive?‡Intervene and destroy him!
15061	19	74	12	‡But God has been my king from ancient times,‡performing acts of deliverance on the earth.
15062	19	74	13	‡You destroyed the sea by your strength;‡you shattered the heads of the sea monster in the water.
15063	19	74	14	‡You crushed the heads of Leviathan; ‡you fed him to the people who live along the coast.
15064	19	74	15	‡You broke open the spring and the stream; ‡you dried up perpetually flowing rivers.
15065	19	74	16	‡You established the cycle of day and night; ‡you put the moon and sun in place.
15066	19	74	17	‡You set up all the boundaries of the earth;‡you created the cycle of summer and winter.
15067	19	74	18	‡Remember how the enemy hurls insults, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡and how a foolish nation blasphemes your name!
15068	19	74	19	‡Do not hand the life of your dove over to a wild animal!‡Do not continue to disregard the lives of your oppressed people!
15069	19	74	20	‡Remember your covenant promises, ‡for the dark regions of the earth are full of places where violence rules.
15070	19	74	21	‡Do not let the afflicted be turned back in shame!‡Let the oppressed and poor praise your name!
15071	19	74	22	‡Rise up, O God! Defend your honor! ‡Remember how fools insult you all day long!

15077	19	75	5	‡Do not be so certain you have won! ‡Do not speak with your head held so high!

15089	19	76	7	‡You are awesome! Yes, you!‡Who can withstand your intense anger?
15090	19	76	8	‡From heaven you announced what their punishment would be. ‡The earth was afraid and silent
15091	19	76	9	‡when God arose to execute judgment,‡and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)
15092	19	76	10	‡Certainly your angry judgment upon men will bring you praise; ‡you reveal your anger in full measure.
15093	19	76	11	‡Make vows to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and repay them!‡Let all those who surround him bring tribute to the awesome one!

15095	19	77	1	¶For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of Asaph.†I will cry out to God and call for help!‡I will cry out to God and he will pay attention to me.
15096	19	77	2	‡In my time of trouble I sought the Lord.‡I kept my hand raised in prayer throughout the night. ‡I refused to be comforted.
15097	19	77	3	‡I said, “I will remember God while I groan;‡I will think about him while my strength leaves me.” (Selah)
15098	19	77	4	‡You held my eyelids open; ‡I was troubled and could not speak.
15099	19	77	5	‡I thought about the days of old,‡about ancient times.
15100	19	77	6	‡I said, “During the night I will remember the song I once sang;‡I will think very carefully.”‡I tried to make sense of what was happening.
15101	19	77	7	‡I asked, “Will the Lord reject me forever?‡Will he never again show me his favor?
15102	19	77	8	‡Has his loyal love disappeared forever?‡Has his promise failed forever?
15103	19	77	9	‡Has God forgotten to be merciful?‡Has his anger stifled his compassion?” (Selah)
15104	19	77	10	‡Then I said, “I am sickened by the thought‡that the Most High might become inactive.

15171	19	78	57	‡They were unfaithful and acted as treacherously as their ancestors;‡they were as unreliable as a malfunctioning bow.

15574	19	104	2	‡He covers himself with light as if it were a garment.‡He stretches out the skies like a tent curtain,
15575	19	104	3	‡and lays the beams of the upper rooms of his palace on the rain clouds. ‡He makes the clouds his chariot,‡and travels along on the wings of the wind.

15577	19	104	5	‡He established the earth on its foundations;‡it will never be moved.

15585	19	104	13	‡He waters the mountains from the upper rooms of his palace; ‡the earth is full of the fruit you cause to grow.
15586	19	104	14	‡He provides grass for the cattle,‡and crops for people to cultivate, ‡so they can produce food from the ground,
15587	19	104	15	‡as well as wine that makes people feel so good, ‡and so they can have oil to make their faces shine, ‡as well as food that sustains people’s lives.
15588	19	104	16	‡The trees of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> receive all the rain they need, ‡the cedars of Lebanon which he planted,

15590	19	104	18	‡The wild goats live in the high mountains; ‡the rock badgers find safety in the cliffs.
15591	19	104	19	‡He made the moon to mark the months, ‡and the sun sets according to a regular schedule.
15592	19	104	20	‡You make it dark and night comes, ‡during which all the beasts of the forest prowl around.

15615	19	105	8	‡He always remembers his covenantal decree,‡the promise he made to a thousand generations –
15616	19	105	9	‡the promise he made to Abraham,‡the promise he made by oath to Isaac!
15617	19	105	10	‡He gave it to Jacob as a decree,‡to Israel as a lasting promise,

15619	19	105	12	‡When they were few in number,‡just a very few, and resident foreigners within it,
15620	19	105	13	‡they wandered from nation to nation,‡and from one kingdom to another.
15621	19	105	14	‡He let no one oppress them;‡he disciplined kings for their sake,

15623	19	105	16	‡He called down a famine upon the earth;‡he cut off all the food supply.
15624	19	105	17	‡He sent a man ahead of them – ‡Joseph was sold as a servant.
15625	19	105	18	‡The shackles hurt his feet; ‡his neck was placed in an iron collar,

15627	19	105	20	‡The king authorized his release; ‡the ruler of nations set him free.
15628	19	105	21	‡He put him in charge of his palace, ‡and made him manager of all his property,
15629	19	105	22	‡giving him authority to imprison his officials ‡and to teach his advisers.
15630	19	105	23	‡Israel moved to Egypt;‡Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham.
15631	19	105	24	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> made his people very fruitful,‡and made them more numerous than their enemies.
15632	19	105	25	‡He caused them to hate his people,‡and to mistreat his servants.
15633	19	105	26	‡He sent his servant Moses,‡and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
15634	19	105	27	‡They executed his miraculous signs among them, ‡and his amazing deeds in the land of Ham.
15635	19	105	28	‡He made it dark; ‡they did not disobey his orders.
15636	19	105	29	‡He turned their water into blood,‡and killed their fish.
15637	19	105	30	‡Their land was overrun by frogs,‡which even got into the rooms of their kings.
15638	19	105	31	‡He ordered flies to come; ‡gnats invaded their whole territory.
15639	19	105	32	‡He sent hail along with the rain; ‡there was lightning in their land.
15640	19	105	33	‡He destroyed their vines and fig trees,‡and broke the trees throughout their territory.
15641	19	105	34	‡He ordered locusts to come, ‡innumerable grasshoppers.
15642	19	105	35	‡They ate all the vegetation in their land,‡and devoured the crops of their fields.
15643	19	105	36	‡He struck down all the firstborn in their land,‡the firstfruits of their reproductive power.
15644	19	105	37	‡He brought his people out enriched with silver and gold;‡none of his tribes stumbled.
15645	19	105	38	‡Egypt was happy when they left,‡for they were afraid of them.
15646	19	105	39	‡He spread out a cloud for a cover, ‡and provided a fire to light up the night.

15659	19	106	7	‡Our ancestors in Egypt failed to appreciate your miraculous deeds,‡they failed to remember your many acts of loyal love,‡and they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.
15660	19	106	8	‡Yet he delivered them for the sake of his reputation, ‡that he might reveal his power.
15661	19	106	9	‡He shouted at the Red Sea and it dried up;‡he led them through the deep water as if it were a desert.
15662	19	106	10	‡He delivered them from the power of the one who hated them,‡and rescued them from the power of the enemy.
15663	19	106	11	‡The water covered their enemies;‡not even one of them survived.
15664	19	106	12	‡They believed his promises; ‡they sang praises to him.
15665	19	106	13	‡They quickly forgot what he had done; ‡they did not wait for his instructions.
15666	19	106	14	‡In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving for meat; ‡they challenged God in the wastelands.
15667	19	106	15	‡He granted their request,‡then struck them with a disease.
15668	19	106	16	‡In the camp they resented Moses,‡and Aaron, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s holy priest.
15669	19	106	17	‡The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;‡it engulfed the group led by Abiram.
15670	19	106	18	‡Fire burned their group;‡the flames scorched the wicked.
15671	19	106	19	‡They made an image of a calf at Horeb,‡and worshiped a metal idol.
15672	19	106	20	‡They traded their majestic God ‡for the image of an ox that eats grass.
15673	19	106	21	‡They rejected the God who delivered them,‡the one who performed great deeds in Egypt,
15674	19	106	22	‡amazing feats in the land of Ham,‡mighty acts by the Red Sea.
15675	19	106	23	‡He threatened to destroy them,‡but Moses, his chosen one, interceded with him ‡and turned back his destructive anger.
15676	19	106	24	‡They rejected the fruitful land; ‡they did not believe his promise.
15677	19	106	25	‡They grumbled in their tents; ‡they did not obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
15678	19	106	26	‡So he made a solemn vow ‡that he would make them die in the wilderness,
15679	19	106	27	‡make their descendants die among the nations,‡and scatter them among foreign lands.
15680	19	106	28	‡They worshiped Baal of Peor,‡and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
15681	19	106	29	‡They made the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> angry by their actions,‡and a plague broke out among them.
15682	19	106	30	‡Phinehas took a stand and intervened, ‡and the plague subsided.
15683	19	106	31	‡This was credited to him as a righteous act‡for all generations to come.
15684	19	106	32	‡They made him angry by the waters of Meribah,‡and Moses suffered because of them,

15686	19	106	34	‡They did not destroy the nations, ‡as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded them to do.
15687	19	106	35	‡They mixed in with the nations‡and learned their ways.
15688	19	106	36	‡They worshiped their idols,‡which became a snare to them.
15689	19	106	37	‡They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
15690	19	106	38	‡They shed innocent blood – ‡the blood of their sons and daughters,‡whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.‡The land was polluted by bloodshed.
15691	19	106	39	‡They were defiled by their deeds,‡and unfaithful in their actions.
15692	19	106	40	‡So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was angry with his people ‡and despised the people who belong to him.
15693	19	106	41	‡He handed them over to the nations,‡and those who hated them ruled over them.
15694	19	106	42	‡Their enemies oppressed them;‡they were subject to their authority.
15695	19	106	43	‡Many times he delivered them,‡but they had a rebellious attitude, ‡and degraded themselves by their sin.
15696	19	106	44	‡Yet he took notice of their distress,‡when he heard their cry for help.
15697	19	106	45	‡He remembered his covenant with them,‡and relented because of his great loyal love.

16095	19	122	5	‡Indeed, the leaders sit there on thrones and make legal decisions,‡on the thrones of the house of David.
16096	19	122	6	‡Pray for the peace of Jerusalem!‡May those who love her prosper!

16100	19	123	1	¶A song of ascents. †I look up toward you,‡the one enthroned in heaven.
16101	19	123	2	‡Look, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,‡as the eyes of a female servant look to the hand of her mistress, ‡so our eyes will look to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, our God, until he shows us favor.

16107	19	124	4	‡The water would have overpowered us;‡the current would have overwhelmed us.
16108	19	124	5	‡The raging water‡would have overwhelmed us.
16109	19	124	6	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> deserves praise, ‡for he did not hand us over as prey to their teeth.

16116	19	125	5	‡As for those who are bent on traveling a sinful path, ‡may the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> remove them, along with those who behave wickedly! ‡May Israel experience peace!
16117	19	126	1	¶A song of ascents. †When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> restored the well-being of Zion, ‡we thought we were dreaming.
16118	19	126	2	‡At that time we laughed loudly‡and shouted for joy. ‡At that time the nations said, ‡“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has accomplished great things for these people.”
16119	19	126	3	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did indeed accomplish great things for us.‡We were happy.

16121	19	126	5	‡Those who shed tears as they plant‡will shout for joy when they reap the harvest.
16122	19	126	6	‡The one who weeps as he walks along, carrying his bag of seed,‡will certainly come in with a shout of joy, carrying his sheaves of grain.
16123	19	127	1	¶A song of ascents, by Solomon.†If the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> does not build a house, ‡then those who build it work in vain.‡If the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> does not guard a city, ‡then the watchman stands guard in vain.
16124	19	127	2	‡It is vain for you to rise early, come home late,‡and work so hard for your food. ‡Yes, he provides for those whom he loves even when they sleep.
16125	19	127	3	‡Yes, sons are a gift from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡the fruit of the womb is a reward.
16126	19	127	4	‡Sons born during one’s youth‡are like arrows in a warrior’s hand.
16127	19	127	5	‡How blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them!‡They will not be put to shame when they confront enemies at the city gate.

16130	19	128	3	‡Your wife will be like a fruitful vine ‡in the inner rooms of your house;‡your children will be like olive branches,‡as they sit all around your table.
16131	19	128	4	‡Yes indeed, the man who fears the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡will be blessed in this way.
16132	19	128	5	‡May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> bless you from Zion,‡that you might see Jerusalem prosper‡all the days of your life,

16139	19	129	6	‡May they be like the grass on the rooftops‡which withers before one can even pull it up,

16150	19	131	1	¶A song of ascents, by David.†O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, my heart is not proud,‡nor do I have a haughty look. ‡I do not have great aspirations,‡or concern myself with things that are beyond me.

16155	19	132	3	‡He said, “I will not enter my own home, ‡or get into my bed.
16156	19	132	4	‡I will not allow my eyes to sleep,‡or my eyelids to slumber,
16157	19	132	5	‡until I find a place for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡a fine dwelling place for the Powerful One of Jacob.”
16158	19	132	6	‡Look, we heard about it in Ephrathah, ‡we found it in the territory of Jaar.

16402	20	1	1	‡The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
16403	20	1	2	‡To learn wisdom and moral instruction, ‡to discern wise counsel.

16406	20	1	5	‡(Let the wise also hear and gain instruction, ‡and let the discerning acquire guidance!)

16412	20	1	11	‡If they say, “Come with us!‡We will lie in wait to shed blood; ‡we will ambush an innocent person capriciously.

16416	20	1	15	‡My child, do not go down their way, ‡withhold yourself from their path;

16418	20	1	17	‡Surely it is futile to spread a net‡in plain sight of any bird,

16421	20	1	20	‡Wisdom calls out in the street, ‡she shouts loudly in the plazas;

16426	20	1	25	‡and you neglected all my advice,‡and did not comply with my rebuke,

16428	20	1	27	‡when what you dread comes like a whirlwind, ‡and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm, ‡when distressing trouble comes on you.
16429	20	1	28	‡Then they will call to me, but I will not answer;‡they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.

16451	20	2	17	‡who leaves the husband from her younger days, ‡and has ignored her marriage covenant made before God.
16452	20	2	18	‡For she has set her house by death, ‡and her paths by the place of the departed spirits.
16453	20	2	19	‡None who go in to her will return, ‡nor will they reach the paths of life.
16454	20	2	20	‡So you will walk in the way of good people, ‡and will keep on the paths of the righteous.

16459	20	3	3	‡Do not let mercy and truth leave you;‡bind them around your neck,‡write them on the tablet of your heart.
16460	20	3	4	‡Then you will find favor and good understanding, ‡in the sight of God and people.
16461	20	3	5	‡Trust in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with all your heart, ‡and do not rely on your own understanding.
16462	20	3	6	‡Acknowledge him in all your ways, ‡and he will make your paths straight.
16463	20	3	7	‡Do not be wise in your own estimation; ‡fear the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and turn away from evil.
16464	20	3	8	‡This will bring healing to your body, ‡and refreshment to your inner self.
16465	20	3	9	‡Honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from your wealth‡and from the first fruits of all your crops;
16466	20	3	10	‡then your barns will be filled completely, ‡and your vats will overflow with new wine.
16467	20	3	11	‡My child, do not despise discipline from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> ‡and do not loathe his rebuke.
16468	20	3	12	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> disciplines those he loves,‡just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.
16469	20	3	13	‡Blessed is the one who has found wisdom,‡and the one who obtains understanding.
16470	20	3	14	‡For her benefit is more profitable than silver,‡and her gain is better than gold.
16471	20	3	15	‡She is more precious than rubies,‡and none of the things you desire can compare with her.
16472	20	3	16	‡Long life is in her right hand;‡in her left hand are riches and honor.
16473	20	3	17	‡Her ways are very pleasant, ‡and all her paths are peaceful.
16474	20	3	18	‡She is like a tree of life to those who grasp onto her, ‡and everyone who takes hold of her will be blessed.
16475	20	3	19	‡By wisdom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> laid the foundation of the earth; ‡he established the heavens by understanding.
16476	20	3	20	‡By his knowledge the primordial sea was broken open, ‡so that the clouds drip down dew.
16477	20	3	21	‡My child, do not let them escape from your sight;‡safeguard sound wisdom and discretion.
16478	20	3	22	‡So they will become life for your soul, ‡and grace around your neck.
16479	20	3	23	‡Then you will walk on your way with security,‡and you will not stumble.
16480	20	3	24	‡When you lie down you will not be filled with fear; ‡when you lie down your sleep will be pleasant.
16481	20	3	25	‡Do not be afraid of sudden disaster, ‡or when destruction overtakes the wicked;
16482	20	3	26	‡for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be the source of your confidence, ‡and he will guard your foot from being caught in a trap.
16483	20	3	27	‡Do not withhold good from those who need it, ‡when you have the ability to help.
16484	20	3	28	‡Do not say to your neighbor, “Go! Return tomorrow‡and I will give it,” when you have it with you at the time.
16485	20	3	29	‡Do not plot evil against your neighbor‡when he dwells by you unsuspectingly.
16486	20	3	30	‡Do not accuse anyone without legitimate cause, ‡if he has not treated you wrongly.
16487	20	3	31	‡Do not envy a violent man, ‡and do not choose any of his ways;
16488	20	3	32	‡for one who goes astray is an abomination to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> ‡but he reveals his intimate counsel to the upright.
16489	20	3	33	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s curse is on the household of the wicked, ‡but he blesses the home of the righteous.
16490	20	3	34	‡With arrogant scoffers he is scornful,‡yet he shows favor to the humble.
16491	20	3	35	‡The wise inherit honor,‡but he holds fools up to public contempt.
16492	20	4	1	‡Listen, children, to a father’s instruction, ‡and pay attention so that you may gain discernment.
16493	20	4	2	‡Because I hereby give you good instruction,‡do not forsake my teaching.‡
16494	20	4	3	‡When I was a son to my father, ‡a tender only child before my mother,
16495	20	4	4	‡he taught me, and he said to me:‡“Let your heart lay hold of my words;‡keep my commands so that you will live.
16496	20	4	5	‡Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding;‡do not forget and do not turn aside from the words I speak.
16497	20	4	6	‡Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you;‡love her, and she will guard you.
16498	20	4	7	‡Wisdom is supreme – so acquire wisdom,‡and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding!
16499	20	4	8	‡Esteem her highly and she will exalt you;‡she will honor you if you embrace her.
16500	20	4	9	‡She will place a fair garland on your head;‡she will bestow a beautiful crown on you.”
16501	20	4	10	‡Listen, my child, and accept my words,‡so that the years of your life will be many.
16502	20	4	11	‡I hereby guide you in the way of wisdom‡and I lead you in upright paths.
16503	20	4	12	‡When you walk, your steps will not be hampered, ‡and when you run, you will not stumble.
16504	20	4	13	‡Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;‡protect it, because it is your life.
16505	20	4	14	‡Do not enter the path of the wicked‡or walk in the way of those who are evil.
16506	20	4	15	‡Avoid it, do not go on it;‡turn away from it, and go on.
16507	20	4	16	‡For they cannot sleep unless they cause harm; ‡they are robbed of sleep until they make someone stumble.
16508	20	4	17	‡Indeed they have eaten bread gained from wickedness ‡and drink wine obtained from violence.
16509	20	4	18	‡But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light, ‡growing brighter and brighter until full day.
16510	20	4	19	‡The way of the wicked is like gloomy darkness;‡they do not know what they stumble over. ‡
16511	20	4	20	‡My child, pay attention to my words;‡listen attentively to my sayings.
16512	20	4	21	‡Do not let them depart from your sight,‡guard them within your heart;
16513	20	4	22	‡for they are life to those who find them ‡and healing to one’s entire body.
16514	20	4	23	‡Guard your heart with all vigilance, ‡for from it are the sources of life.
16515	20	4	24	‡Remove perverse speech from your mouth; ‡keep devious talk far from your lips.
16516	20	4	25	‡Let your eyes look directly in front of you‡and let your gaze look straight before you.
16517	20	4	26	‡Make the path for your feet level, ‡so that all your ways may be established.
16518	20	4	27	‡Do not turn to the right or to the left;‡turn yourself away from evil.
16519	20	5	1	‡My child, be attentive to my wisdom,‡pay close attention to my understanding,
16520	20	5	2	‡in order to safeguard discretion, ‡and that your lips may guard knowledge.
16521	20	5	3	‡For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,‡and her seductive words are smoother than olive oil,
16522	20	5	4	‡but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, ‡sharp as a two-edged sword.
16523	20	5	5	‡Her feet go down to death;‡her steps lead straight to the grave.
16524	20	5	6	‡Lest she should make level the path leading to life, ‡her paths have wandered, but she is not able to discern it.
16525	20	5	7	‡So now, children, listen to me;‡do not turn aside from the words I speak.
16526	20	5	8	‡Keep yourself far from her,‡and do not go near the door of her house,
16527	20	5	9	‡lest you give your vigor to others ‡and your years to a cruel person,
16528	20	5	10	‡lest strangers devour your strength, ‡and your labor benefit another man’s house.
16529	20	5	11	‡And at the end of your life you will groan ‡when your flesh and your body are wasted away.
16530	20	5	12	‡And you will say, “How I hated discipline!‡My heart spurned reproof!
16531	20	5	13	‡For I did not obey my teachers ‡and I did not heed my instructors.
16532	20	5	14	‡I almost came to complete ruin ‡in the midst of the whole congregation!”
16533	20	5	15	‡Drink water from your own cistern‡and running water from your own well.
16534	20	5	16	‡Should your springs be dispersed outside,‡your streams of water in the wide plazas?
16535	20	5	17	‡Let them be for yourself alone,‡and not for strangers with you.
16536	20	5	18	‡May your fountain be blessed, ‡and may you rejoice in the wife you married in your youth –
16537	20	5	19	‡a loving doe, a graceful deer;‡may her breasts satisfy you at all times,‡may you be captivated by her love always.
16538	20	5	20	‡But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress,‡and embrace the bosom of a different woman?
16539	20	5	21	‡For the ways of a person are in front of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s eyes,‡and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> weighs all that person’s paths.
16540	20	5	22	‡The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities, ‡and he will be held by the cords of his own sin.
16541	20	5	23	‡He will die because there was no discipline;‡because of the greatness of his folly he will reel.
16542	20	6	1	‡My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor, ‡if you have become a guarantor for a stranger,
16543	20	6	2	‡if you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered, ‡and have been caught by the words you have spoken,
16544	20	6	3	‡then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself, ‡because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power: ‡go, humble yourself, ‡and appeal firmly to your neighbor.
16545	20	6	4	‡Permit no sleep to your eyes ‡or slumber to your eyelids.
16546	20	6	5	‡Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare, ‡and like a bird from the trap of the fowler.
16547	20	6	6	‡Go to the ant, you sluggard; ‡observe its ways and be wise!
16548	20	6	7	‡It has no commander, ‡overseer, or ruler,
16549	20	6	8	‡yet it would prepare its food in the summer;‡it gathered at the harvest what it will eat.
16550	20	6	9	‡How long, you sluggard, will you lie there?‡When will you rise from your sleep?
16551	20	6	10	‡A little sleep, a little slumber,‡a little folding of the hands to relax,
16552	20	6	11	‡and your poverty will come like a robber, ‡and your need like an armed man.
16553	20	6	12	‡A worthless and wicked person ‡walks around saying perverse things;
16554	20	6	13	‡he winks with his eyes,‡signals with his feet,‡and points with his fingers;
16555	20	6	14	‡he plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart,‡he spreads contention at all times.
16556	20	6	15	‡Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;‡in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.
16557	20	6	16	‡There are six things that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hates,‡even seven things that are an abomination to him:
16558	20	6	17	‡haughty eyes, a lying tongue, ‡and hands that shed innocent blood,
16559	20	6	18	‡a heart that devises wicked plans, ‡feet that are swift to run to evil,
16560	20	6	19	‡a false witness who pours out lies, ‡and a person who spreads discord among family members.
16561	20	6	20	‡My child, guard the commands of your father‡and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.
16562	20	6	21	‡Bind them on your heart continually;‡fasten them around your neck.
16563	20	6	22	‡When you walk about, they will guide you; ‡when you lie down, they will watch over you;‡when you wake up, they will talk to you.
16564	20	6	23	‡For the commandments are like a lamp, ‡instruction is like a light,‡and rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,
16565	20	6	24	‡by keeping you from the evil woman, ‡from the smooth tongue of the loose woman.
16566	20	6	25	‡Do not lust in your heart for her beauty,‡and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;
16567	20	6	26	‡for on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread,‡but the wife of another man preys on your precious life.
16568	20	6	27	‡Can a man hold fire against his chest ‡without burning his clothes?
16569	20	6	28	‡Can a man walk on hot coals‡without scorching his feet?
16570	20	6	29	‡So it is with the one who sleeps with his neighbor’s wife;‡no one who touches her will escape punishment.
16571	20	6	30	‡People do not despise a thief when he steals‡to fulfill his need when he is hungry.
16572	20	6	31	‡Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over,‡he might even have to give all the wealth of his house.
16573	20	6	32	‡A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense, ‡whoever does it destroys his own life.
16574	20	6	33	‡He will be beaten and despised, ‡and his reproach will not be wiped away;
16575	20	6	34	‡for jealousy kindles a husband’s rage,‡and he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.
16576	20	6	35	‡He will not consider any compensation; ‡he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.
16577	20	7	1	‡My child, devote yourself to my words‡and store up my commands inside yourself.
16578	20	7	2	‡Keep my commands so that you may live, ‡and obey my instruction as your most prized possession.
16579	20	7	3	‡Bind them on your forearm; ‡write them on the tablet of your heart.
16580	20	7	4	‡Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” ‡and call understanding a close relative,
16581	20	7	5	‡so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman, ‡from the loose woman who has flattered you with her words.
16582	20	7	6	‡For at the window of my house‡through my window lattice I looked out
16583	20	7	7	‡and I saw among the naive – ‡I discerned among the youths – ‡a young man who lacked sense.
16584	20	7	8	‡He was passing by the street near her corner,‡making his way along the road to her house
16585	20	7	9	‡in the twilight, the evening, ‡in the dark of the night.
16586	20	7	10	‡Suddenly a woman came out to meet him!‡She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent.
16587	20	7	11	‡(She is loud and rebellious,‡she does not remain at home –
16588	20	7	12	‡at one time outside, at another in the wide plazas,‡and by every corner she lies in wait.)
16589	20	7	13	‡So she grabbed him and kissed him,‡and with a bold expression she said to him,
16590	20	7	14	‡“I have meat from my peace offerings at home; ‡today I have fulfilled my vows!
16591	20	7	15	‡That is why I came out to meet you,‡to look for you, and I found you!
16592	20	7	16	‡I have spread my bed with elegant coverings, ‡with richly colored fabric from Egypt.
16593	20	7	17	‡I have perfumed my bed ‡with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
16594	20	7	18	‡Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning,‡let’s delight ourselves with love’s pleasures.
16595	20	7	19	‡For my husband is not at home; ‡he has gone on a journey of some distance.
16596	20	7	20	‡He has taken a bag of money with him; ‡he will not return until the end of the month.”
16597	20	7	21	‡She turned him aside with her persuasions; ‡with her smooth talk she was enticing him along.
16598	20	7	22	‡Suddenly he was going after her‡like an ox that goes to the slaughter,‡like a stag prancing into a trapper’s snare
16599	20	7	23	‡till an arrow pierces his liver – ‡like a bird hurrying into a trap,‡and he does not know that it will cost him his life.
16600	20	7	24	‡So now, sons, listen to me,‡and pay attention to the words I speak.
16601	20	7	25	‡Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways – ‡do not wander into her pathways;
16602	20	7	26	‡for she has brought down many fatally wounded,‡and all those she has slain are many.
16603	20	7	27	‡Her house is the way to the grave, ‡going down to the chambers of death.
16604	20	8	1	‡Does not wisdom call out?‡Does not understanding raise her voice?
16605	20	8	2	‡At the top of the prominent places along the way,‡at the intersection of the paths she has taken her stand;
16606	20	8	3	‡beside the gates opening into the city,‡at the entrance of the doorways she cries out:
16607	20	8	4	‡“To you, O people, I call out,‡and my voice calls to all mankind.
16608	20	8	5	‡You who are naive, discern wisdom!‡And you fools, understand discernment!
16609	20	8	6	‡Listen, for I will speak excellent things, ‡and my lips will utter what is right.
16610	20	8	7	‡For my mouth speaks truth, ‡and my lips hate wickedness.
16611	20	8	8	‡All the words of my mouth are righteous; ‡there is nothing in them twisted or crooked.
16612	20	8	9	‡All of them are clear to the discerning‡and upright to those who find knowledge.
16613	20	8	10	‡Receive my instruction rather than silver,‡and knowledge rather than choice gold.
16614	20	8	11	‡For wisdom is better than rubies,‡and desirable things cannot be compared to her.
16615	20	8	12	‡“I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, ‡and I find knowledge and discretion.
16616	20	8	13	‡The fear of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is to hate evil;‡I hate arrogant pride and the evil way‡and perverse utterances.
16617	20	8	14	‡Counsel and sound wisdom belong to me; ‡I possess understanding and might.
16618	20	8	15	‡By me kings reign,‡and by me potentates decree righteousness;
16619	20	8	16	‡by me princes rule,‡as well as nobles and all righteous judges.
16620	20	8	17	‡I will love those who love me,‡and those who seek me diligently will find me.
16621	20	8	18	‡Riches and honor are with me,‡long-lasting wealth and righteousness.
16622	20	8	19	‡My fruit is better than the purest gold, ‡and my harvest is better than choice silver.
16623	20	8	20	‡I walk in the path of righteousness,‡in the pathway of justice,
16624	20	8	21	‡that I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth,‡and that I may fill their treasuries.
16625	20	8	22	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> created me as the beginning of his works, ‡before his deeds of long ago.
16626	20	8	23	‡From eternity I have been fashioned, ‡from the beginning, from before the world existed.
16627	20	8	24	‡When there were no deep oceans I was born, ‡when there were no springs overflowing with water;
16628	20	8	25	‡before the mountains were set in place – ‡before the hills – I was born,
16629	20	8	26	‡before he made the earth and its fields, ‡or the top soil of the world.
16630	20	8	27	‡When he established the heavens, I was there;‡when he marked out the horizon over the face of the deep,
16631	20	8	28	‡when he established the clouds above,‡when he secured the fountains of the deep,
16632	20	8	29	‡when he gave the sea his decree ‡that the waters should not pass over his command, ‡when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
16633	20	8	30	‡then I was beside him as a master craftsman, ‡and I was his delight day by day,‡rejoicing before him at all times,
16634	20	8	31	‡rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, ‡and delighting in its people.
16635	20	8	32	‡“So now, children, listen to me;‡blessed are those who keep my ways.
16636	20	8	33	‡Listen to my instruction so that you may be wise, ‡and do not neglect it.
16637	20	8	34	‡Blessed is the one who listens to me,‡watching at my doors day by day,‡waiting beside my doorway.
16638	20	8	35	‡For the one who finds me has found life‡and received favor from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.

16640	20	9	1	‡Wisdom has built her house;‡she has carved out its seven pillars.
16641	20	9	2	‡She has prepared her meat, she has mixed her wine;‡she also has arranged her table.

16649	20	9	10	‡The beginning of wisdom is to fear the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡and acknowledging the Holy One is understanding.

17263	20	30	11	‡There is a generation who curse their fathers‡and do not bless their mothers.
17264	20	30	12	‡There is a generation who are pure in their own opinion‡and yet are not washed from their filthiness.
17265	20	30	13	‡There is a generation whose eyes are so lofty, ‡and whose eyelids are lifted up disdainfully.
17266	20	30	14	‡There is a generation whose teeth are like swords ‡and whose molars are like knives‡to devour the poor from the earth‡and the needy from among the human race.
17267	20	30	15	‡The leech has two daughters: ‡“Give! Give!” ‡There are three things that will never be satisfied,‡four that have never said, “Enough” –
17268	20	30	16	‡the grave, the barren womb; ‡earth has not been satisfied with water;‡and fire has never said, “Enough!”
17269	20	30	17	‡The eye that mocks at a father‡and despises obeying a mother – ‡the ravens of the valley will peck it out‡and the young vultures will eat it.
17270	20	30	18	‡There are three things that are too wonderful for me, ‡four that I do not understand:
17271	20	30	19	‡the way of an eagle in the sky,‡the way of a snake on a rock,‡the way of a ship in the sea,‡and the way of a man with a woman.
17272	20	30	20	‡This is the way of an adulterous woman:‡she has eaten and wiped her mouth ‡and has said, “I have not done wrong.”
17273	20	30	21	‡Under three things the earth has trembled, ‡and under four things it cannot bear up:
17274	20	30	22	‡under a servant who becomes king,‡under a fool who becomes stuffed with food,
17275	20	30	23	‡under an unloved woman who becomes married,‡and under a female servant who dispossesses her mistress.
17276	20	30	24	‡There are four things on earth that are small, ‡but they are exceedingly wise:
17277	20	30	25	‡ants are creatures with little strength,‡but they prepare their food in the summer;
17278	20	30	26	‡rock badgers are creatures with little power,‡but they make their homes in the crags;
17279	20	30	27	‡locusts have no king,‡but they all go forward by ranks;
17280	20	30	28	‡a lizard you can catch with the hand,‡but it gets into the palaces of the king.
17281	20	30	29	‡There are three things that are magnificent in their step,‡four things that move about magnificently:
17282	20	30	30	‡a lion, mightiest of the beasts,‡who does not retreat from anything;
17283	20	30	31	‡a strutting rooster, a male goat,‡and a king with his army around him.
17284	20	30	32	‡If you have done foolishly by exalting yourself ‡or if you have planned evil,‡put your hand over your mouth!
17285	20	30	33	‡For as the churning of milk produces butter‡and as punching the nose produces blood,‡so stirring up anger produces strife.
17286	20	31	1	‡The words of King Lemuel, ‡an oracle that his mother taught him:
17287	20	31	2	‡O my son, O son of my womb,‡O son of my vows,
17288	20	31	3	‡Do not give your strength to women,‡nor your ways to that which ruins kings.
17289	20	31	4	‡It is not for kings, O Lemuel,‡it is not for kings to drink wine, ‡or for rulers to crave strong drink,
17290	20	31	5	‡lest they drink and forget what is decreed,‡and remove from all the poor their legal rights.
17291	20	31	6	‡Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, ‡and wine to those who are bitterly distressed;
17292	20	31	7	‡let them drink and forget their poverty,‡and remember their misery no more.
17293	20	31	8	‡Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak, ‡for the legal rights of all the dying.
17294	20	31	9	‡Open your mouth, judge in righteousness, ‡and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
17295	20	31	10	‡Who can find a wife of noble character? ‡For her value is far more than rubies.
17296	20	31	11	‡Her husband’s heart has trusted her,‡and he does not lack the dividends.
17297	20	31	12	‡She has rewarded him with good and not harm ‡all the days of her life.
17298	20	31	13	‡She sought out wool and flax,‡then worked happily with her hands.
17299	20	31	14	‡She was like the merchant ships; ‡she would bring in her food from afar.
17300	20	31	15	‡Then she rose while it was still night,‡and provided food for her household and a portion to her female servants.
17301	20	31	16	‡She considered a field and bought it;‡from her own income she planted a vineyard.
17302	20	31	17	‡She clothed herself in might,‡and she strengthened her arms.
17303	20	31	18	‡She perceived that her merchandise was good.‡Her lamp would not go out in the night.
17304	20	31	19	‡She extended her hands to the spool,‡and her hands grasped the spindle.
17305	20	31	20	‡She opened her hand to the poor,‡and extended her hands to the needy.
17306	20	31	21	‡She would not fear for her household in winter, ‡because all of her household were clothed with scarlet,
17307	20	31	22	‡because she had made coverings for herself; ‡and because her clothing was fine linen and purple.
17308	20	31	23	‡Her husband is well-known in the city gate ‡when he sits with the elders of the land.
17309	20	31	24	‡She made linen garments then sold them,‡and traded belts to the merchants;
17310	20	31	25	‡her clothing was strong and splendid;‡and she laughed at the time to come.
17311	20	31	26	‡She has opened her mouth with wisdom,‡with loving instruction on her tongue.
17312	20	31	27	‡Watching over the ways of her household,‡she would not eat the bread of idleness.
17313	20	31	28	‡Her children have risen and called her blessed;‡her husband also has praised her:
17314	20	31	29	‡“Many daughters have done valiantly, ‡but you have surpassed them all!”
17315	20	31	30	‡Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting. ‡A woman who fears the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord–</span> she makes herself praiseworthy.
17316	20	31	31	‡Give her credit for what she has accomplished, ‡and let her works praise her in the city gates.
17317	21	1	1	¶The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
17318	21	1	2	‡“Futile! Futile!” laments the Teacher, ‡“Absolutely futile! Everything is futile!”
17319	21	1	3	‡What benefit do people get from all the effort‡which they expend on earth?
17320	21	1	4	‡A generation comes and a generation goes, ‡but the earth remains the same through the ages.
17321	21	1	5	‡The sun rises and the sun sets; ‡it hurries away to a place from which it rises again.
17322	21	1	6	‡The wind goes to the south and circles around to the north;‡round and round the wind goes and on its rounds it returns.
17323	21	1	7	‡All the streams flow into the sea, but the sea is not full,‡and to the place where the streams flow, there they will flow again.
17324	21	1	8	‡All this monotony is tiresome; no one can bear to describe it: ‡The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear ever content with hearing.
17325	21	1	9	‡What exists now is what will be, ‡and what has been done is what will be done;‡there is nothing truly new on earth.
17326	21	1	10	‡Is there anything about which someone can say, “Look at this! It is new!”? ‡It was already done long ago, before our time.
17327	21	1	11	‡No one remembers the former events, ‡nor will anyone remember the events that are yet to happen; ‡they will not be remembered by the future generations.
17328	21	1	12	‡I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
17329	21	1	13	‡I decided to carefully and thoroughly examine ‡all that has been accomplished on earth. ‡I concluded: God has given people a burdensome task ‡that keeps them occupied.
17330	21	1	14	‡I reflected on everything that is accomplished by man on earth, ‡and I concluded: Everything he has accomplished is futile – like chasing the wind!
17331	21	1	15	‡What is bent cannot be straightened, ‡and what is missing cannot be supplied.
17332	21	1	16	‡I thought to myself, ‡“I have become much wiser than any of my predecessors who ruled over Jerusalem; ‡I have acquired much wisdom and knowledge.”
17333	21	1	17	‡So I decided to discern the benefit of wisdom and knowledge over foolish behavior and ideas; ‡however, I concluded that even this endeavor is like trying to chase the wind!
17334	21	1	18	‡For with great wisdom comes great frustration;‡whoever increases his knowledge merely increases his heartache.
17335	21	2	1	¶I thought to myself, ‡“Come now, I will try self-indulgent pleasure to see if it is worthwhile.” ‡But I found that it also is futile.
17336	21	2	2	‡I said of partying, “It is folly,”‡and of self-indulgent pleasure, “It accomplishes nothing!”
17337	21	2	3	‡I thought deeply about the effects of indulging myself with wine‡(all the while my mind was guiding me with wisdom) ‡and the effects of behaving foolishly, ‡so that I might discover what is profitable ‡for people to do on earth during the few days of their lives.
17338	21	2	4	‡I increased my possessions: ‡I built houses for myself; ‡I planted vineyards for myself.
17339	21	2	5	‡I designed royal gardens and parks for myself,‡and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
17340	21	2	6	‡I constructed pools of water for myself,‡to irrigate my grove of flourishing trees.
17341	21	2	7	‡I purchased male and female slaves,‡and I owned slaves who were born in my house; ‡I also possessed more livestock – both herds and flocks – ‡than any of my predecessors in Jerusalem.
17342	21	2	8	‡I also amassed silver and gold for myself,‡as well as valuable treasures taken from kingdoms and provinces. ‡I acquired male singers and female singers for myself,‡and what gives a man sensual delight – a harem of beautiful concubines!
17343	21	2	9	‡So I was far wealthier than all my predecessors in Jerusalem,‡yet I maintained my objectivity:
17344	21	2	10	‡I did not restrain myself from getting whatever I wanted; ‡I did not deny myself anything that would bring me pleasure. ‡So all my accomplishments gave me joy; ‡this was my reward for all my effort.
17345	21	2	11	‡Yet when I reflected on everything I had accomplished ‡and on all the effort that I had expended to accomplish it, ‡I concluded: “All these achievements and possessions are ultimately profitless – ‡like chasing the wind!‡There is nothing gained from them on earth.”
17346	21	2	12	‡Next, I decided to consider wisdom, as well as foolish behavior and ideas. ‡For what more can the king’s successor do than what the king has already done?
17347	21	2	13	‡I realized that wisdom is preferable to folly, ‡just as light is preferable to darkness:
17348	21	2	14	‡The wise man can see where he is going, but the fool walks in darkness.‡Yet I also realized that the same fate happens to them both.
17349	21	2	15	‡So I thought to myself, “The fate of the fool will happen even to me! ‡Then what did I gain by becoming so excessively wise?” ‡So I lamented to myself, ‡“The benefits of wisdom are ultimately meaningless!”
17350	21	2	16	‡For the wise man, like the fool, will not be remembered for very long, ‡because in the days to come, both will already have been forgotten. ‡Alas, the wise man dies – just like the fool!
17351	21	2	17	‡So I loathed life because what ‡happens on earth seems awful to me;‡for all the benefits of wisdom are futile – like chasing the wind.
17352	21	2	18	‡So I loathed all the fruit of my effort, ‡for which I worked so hard on earth, ‡because I must leave it behind in the hands of my successor.
17353	21	2	19	‡Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool?‡Yet he will be master over all the fruit of my labor ‡for which I worked so wisely on earth! ‡This also is futile!
17354	21	2	20	‡So I began to despair about all the fruit of my labor ‡for which I worked so hard on earth.
17355	21	2	21	‡For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge, and skill;‡however, he must hand over the fruit of his labor as an inheritance ‡to someone else who did not work for it.‡This also is futile, and an awful injustice!
17356	21	2	22	‡What does a man acquire from all his labor‡and from the anxiety that accompanies his toil on earth?
17357	21	2	23	‡For all day long his work produces pain and frustration, ‡and even at night his mind cannot relax! ‡This also is futile!
17358	21	2	24	‡There is nothing better for people than to eat and drink,‡and to find enjoyment in their work.‡I also perceived that this ability to find enjoyment comes from God.
17359	21	2	25	‡For no one can eat and drink ‡or experience joy apart from him.
17360	21	2	26	‡For to the one who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy,‡but to the sinner, he gives the task of amassing wealth – ‡only to give it to the one who pleases God.‡This task of the wicked is futile – like chasing the wind!
17361	21	3	1	‡For everything there is an appointed time, ‡and an appropriate time for every activity on earth:
17362	21	3	2	‡A time to be born, and a time to die; ‡a time to plant, and a time to uproot what was planted;
17363	21	3	3	‡A time to kill, and a time to heal;‡a time to break down, and a time to build up;
17364	21	3	4	‡A time to weep, and a time to laugh;‡a time to mourn, and a time to dance.
17365	21	3	5	‡A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones;‡a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
17366	21	3	6	‡A time to search, and a time to give something up as lost; ‡a time to keep, and a time to throw away;
17367	21	3	7	‡A time to rip, and a time to sew;‡a time to keep silent, and a time to speak.
17368	21	3	8	‡A time to love, and a time to hate;‡a time for war, and a time for peace.
17369	21	3	9	‡What benefit can a worker gain from his toil?
17370	21	3	10	‡I have observed the burden‡that God has given to people to keep them occupied.
17371	21	3	11	‡God has made everything fit beautifully in its appropriate time,‡but he has also placed ignorance in the human heart ‡so that people cannot discover what God has ordained, ‡from the beginning to the end of their lives.
17372	21	3	12	‡I have concluded that there is nothing better for people ‡than to be happy and to enjoy ‡themselves as long as they live,
17373	21	3	13	‡and also that everyone should eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all his toil,‡for these things are a gift from God.
17374	21	3	14	‡I also know that whatever God does will endure forever;‡nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken away from it.‡God has made it this way, so that men will fear him.
17375	21	3	15	‡Whatever exists now has already been, and whatever will be has already been;‡for God will seek to do again what has occurred in the past.
17376	21	3	16	‡I saw something else on earth: ‡In the place of justice, there was wickedness,‡and in the place of fairness, there was wickedness.
17377	21	3	17	‡I thought to myself, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked;‡for there is an appropriate time for every activity,‡and there is a time of judgment for every deed.
17378	21	3	18	‡I also thought to myself, “It is for the sake of people, ‡so God can clearly show them that they are like animals.
17379	21	3	19	‡For the fate of humans and the fate of animals are the same:‡As one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath.‡There is no advantage for humans over animals,‡for both are fleeting.
17380	21	3	20	‡Both go to the same place,‡both come from the dust,‡and to dust both return.
17381	21	3	21	‡Who really knows if the human spirit ascends upward,‡and the animal’s spirit descends into the earth?
17382	21	3	22	‡So I perceived there is nothing better than for people to enjoy their work, ‡because that is their reward;‡for who can show them what the future holds?
17383	21	4	1	‡So I again considered all the oppression that continually occurs on earth. ‡This is what I saw: ‡The oppressed were in tears, but no one was comforting them;‡no one delivers them from the power of their oppressors.
17384	21	4	2	‡So I considered those who are dead and gone ‡more fortunate than those who are still alive.
17385	21	4	3	‡But better than both is the one who has not been born ‡and has not seen the evil things that are done on earth.
17386	21	4	4	‡Then I considered all the skillful work that is done:‡Surely it is nothing more than competition between one person and another. ‡This also is profitless – like chasing the wind.
17387	21	4	5	‡The fool folds his hands and does no work, ‡so he has nothing to eat but his own flesh.
17388	21	4	6	‡Better is one handful with some rest‡than two hands full of toil and chasing the wind.
17389	21	4	7	‡So I again considered another futile thing on earth:
17390	21	4	8	‡A man who is all alone with no companion, ‡he has no children nor siblings; ‡yet there is no end to all his toil,‡and he is never satisfied with riches.‡He laments, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” ‡This also is futile and a burdensome task!
17391	21	4	9	‡Two people are better than one,‡because they can reap more benefit from their labor.
17392	21	4	10	‡For if they fall, one will help his companion up,‡but pity the person who falls down and has no one to help him up.
17393	21	4	11	‡Furthermore, if two lie down together, they can keep each other warm,‡but how can one person keep warm by himself?
17394	21	4	12	‡Although an assailant may overpower one person,‡two can withstand him.‡Moreover, a three-stranded cord is not quickly broken.
17395	21	4	13	‡A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king‡who no longer knows how to receive advice.
17396	21	4	14	‡For he came out of prison to become king,‡even though he had been born poor in what would become his kingdom.
17397	21	4	15	‡I considered all the living who walk on earth, ‡as well as the successor who would arise in his place.
17398	21	4	16	‡There is no end to all the people nor to the past generations, ‡yet future generations will not rejoice in him.‡This also is profitless and like chasing the wind.
17399	21	5	1	‡(4:17) Be careful what you do when you go to the temple of God;‡draw near to listen rather than to offer a sacrifice like fools, ‡for they do not realize that they are doing wrong.
17400	21	5	2	‡(5:1) Do not be rash with your mouth or hasty in your heart to bring up a matter before God,‡for God is in heaven and you are on earth!‡Therefore, let your words be few.
17401	21	5	3	‡Just as dreams come when there are many cares, ‡so the rash vow of a fool occurs when there are many words.
17402	21	5	4	‡When you make a vow to God, do not delay in paying it. ‡For God takes no pleasure in fools:‡Pay what you vow!
17403	21	5	5	‡It is better for you not to vow‡than to vow and not pay it.
17404	21	5	6	‡Do not let your mouth cause you to sin,‡and do not tell the priest, “It was a mistake!” ‡Why make God angry at you ‡so that he would destroy the work of your hands?”
17405	21	5	7	‡Just as there is futility in many dreams,‡so also in many words. ‡Therefore, fear God!
17406	21	5	8	‡If you see the extortion of the poor,‡or the perversion of justice and fairness in the government, ‡do not be astonished by the matter.‡For the high official is watched by a higher official, ‡and there are higher ones over them!
17407	21	5	9	‡The produce of the land is seized by all of them,‡even the king is served by the fields.
17408	21	5	10	‡The one who loves money will never be satisfied with money, ‡he who loves wealth will never be satisfied with his income.‡This also is futile.
17409	21	5	11	‡When someone’s prosperity increases, those who consume it also increase;‡so what does its owner gain, except that he gets to see it with his eyes?
17410	21	5	12	‡The sleep of the laborer is pleasant – whether he eats little or much – ‡but the wealth of the rich will not allow him to sleep.
17411	21	5	13	‡Here is a misfortune on earth that I have seen:‡Wealth hoarded by its owner to his own misery.
17412	21	5	14	‡Then that wealth was lost through bad luck; ‡although he fathered a son, he has nothing left to give him.
17413	21	5	15	‡Just as he came forth from his mother’s womb, naked will he return as he came,‡and he will take nothing in his hand that he may carry away from his toil.
17414	21	5	16	‡This is another misfortune: ‡Just as he came, so will he go.‡What did he gain from toiling for the wind?
17415	21	5	17	‡Surely, he ate in darkness every day of his life, ‡and he suffered greatly with sickness and anger.
17416	21	5	18	‡I have seen personally what is the only beneficial and appropriate course of action for people: ‡to eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all their hard work on earth ‡during the few days of their life which God has given them,‡for this is their reward.
17417	21	5	19	‡To every man whom God has given wealth, and possessions,‡he has also given him the ability ‡to eat from them, to receive his reward and to find enjoyment in his toil;‡these things are the gift of God.
17418	21	5	20	‡For he does not think much about the fleeting days of his life‡because God keeps him preoccupied with the joy he derives from his activity.
17419	21	6	1	‡Here is another misfortune that I have seen on earth, ‡and it weighs heavily on people:
17420	21	6	2	‡God gives a man riches, property, and wealth‡so that he lacks nothing that his heart desires, ‡yet God does not enable him to enjoy the fruit of his labor – ‡instead, someone else enjoys it! ‡This is fruitless and a grave misfortune.
17421	21	6	3	‡Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years – ‡even if he lives a long, long time, but cannot enjoy his prosperity – ‡even if he were to live forever – ‡I would say, “A stillborn child is better off than he is!”
17422	21	6	4	‡Though the stillborn child came into the world for no reason and departed into darkness,‡though its name is shrouded in darkness,
17423	21	6	5	‡though it never saw the light of day nor knew anything, ‡yet it has more rest than that man –
17424	21	6	6	‡if he should live a thousand years twice, yet does not enjoy his prosperity.‡For both of them die!
17425	21	6	7	‡All of man’s labor is for nothing more than to fill his stomach – ‡yet his appetite is never satisfied!
17426	21	6	8	‡So what advantage does a wise man have over a fool? ‡And what advantage does a pauper gain by knowing how to survive?
17427	21	6	9	‡It is better to be content with what the eyes can see ‡than for one’s heart always to crave more. ‡This continual longing is futile – like chasing the wind.
17428	21	6	10	‡Whatever has happened was foreordained, ‡and what happens to a person was also foreknown.‡It is useless for him to argue with God about his fate‡because God is more powerful than he is.
17429	21	6	11	‡The more one argues with words, the less he accomplishes. ‡How does that benefit him?
17430	21	6	12	‡For no one knows what is best for a person during his life – ‡during the few days of his fleeting life – ‡for they pass away like a shadow.‡Nor can anyone tell him what the future will hold for him on earth.
17431	21	7	1	‡A good reputation is better than precious perfume; ‡likewise, the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth.
17432	21	7	2	‡It is better to go to a funeral ‡than a feast. ‡For death is the destiny of every person, ‡and the living should take this to heart.
17433	21	7	3	‡Sorrow is better than laughter,‡because sober reflection is good for the heart.
17434	21	7	4	‡The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,‡but the heart of fools is in the house of merrymaking.
17435	21	7	5	‡It is better for a person to receive a rebuke from those who are wise ‡than to listen to the song of fools.
17436	21	7	6	‡For like the crackling of quick-burning thorns under a cooking pot,‡so is the laughter of the fool.‡This kind of folly also is useless.
17437	21	7	7	‡Surely oppression can turn a wise person into a fool; ‡likewise, a bribe corrupts the heart.
17438	21	7	8	‡The end of a matter is better than its beginning;‡likewise, patience is better than pride.
17439	21	7	9	‡Do not let yourself be quickly provoked, ‡for anger resides in the lap of fools.
17440	21	7	10	‡Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these days?” ‡for it is not wise to ask that.
17441	21	7	11	‡Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing;‡it benefits those who see the light of day.
17442	21	7	12	‡For wisdom provides protection, ‡just as money provides protection. ‡But the advantage of knowledge is this:‡Wisdom preserves the life of its owner.
17443	21	7	13	‡Consider the work of God:‡For who can make straight what he has bent?
17444	21	7	14	‡In times of prosperity be joyful,‡but in times of adversity consider this:‡God has made one as well as the other, ‡so that no one can discover what the future holds.
17445	21	7	15	‡During the days of my fleeting life I have seen both of these things:‡Sometimes a righteous person dies prematurely in spite of his righteousness,‡and sometimes a wicked person lives long in spite of his evil deeds.
17446	21	7	16	‡So do not be excessively righteous or excessively wise; ‡otherwise you might be disappointed.
17447	21	7	17	‡Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool;‡otherwise you might die before your time.
17448	21	7	18	‡It is best to take hold of one warning without letting go of the other warning; ‡for the one who fears God will follow both warnings.
17449	21	7	19	‡Wisdom gives a wise person more protection ‡than ten rulers in a city.
17450	21	7	20	‡For there is not one truly righteous person on the earth‡who continually does good and never sins.
17451	21	7	21	‡Also, do not pay attention to everything that people say;‡otherwise, you might even hear your servant cursing you.
17452	21	7	22	‡For you know in your own heart ‡that you also have cursed others many times.
17453	21	7	23	‡I have examined all this by wisdom;‡I said, “I am determined to comprehend this” – but it was beyond my grasp.
17454	21	7	24	‡Whatever has happened is beyond human understanding; ‡it is far deeper than anyone can fathom.
17455	21	7	25	‡I tried to understand, examine, and comprehend ‡the role of wisdom in the scheme of things, ‡and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the insanity of folly.
17456	21	7	26	‡I discovered this: ‡More bitter than death is the kind of woman who is like a hunter’s snare; ‡her heart is like a hunter’s net and her hands are like prison chains.‡The man who pleases God escapes her,‡but the sinner is captured by her.
17457	21	7	27	‡The Teacher says:‡I discovered this while trying to discover the scheme of things, item by item.
17458	21	7	28	‡What I have continually sought, I have not found;‡I have found only one upright man among a thousand,‡but I have not found one upright woman among all of them.
17459	21	7	29	‡This alone have I discovered: God made humankind upright,‡but they have sought many evil schemes.
17460	21	8	1	‡Who is a wise person? Who knows the solution to a problem? ‡A person’s wisdom brightens his appearance, and softens his harsh countenance.
17461	21	8	2	‡Obey the king’s command, ‡because you took an oath before God to be loyal to him.
17462	21	8	3	‡Do not rush out of the king’s presence in haste – do not delay when the matter is unpleasant, ‡for he can do whatever he pleases.
17463	21	8	4	‡Surely the king’s authority is absolute; ‡no one can say to him, “What are you doing?”
17464	21	8	5	‡Whoever obeys his command will not experience harm,‡and a wise person knows the proper time and procedure.
17465	21	8	6	‡For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,‡for the oppression of the king is severe upon his victim.
17466	21	8	7	‡Surely no one knows the future, ‡and no one can tell another person what will happen.
17467	21	8	8	‡Just as no one has power over the wind to restrain it, ‡so no one has power over the day of his death.‡Just as no one can be discharged during the battle, ‡so wickedness cannot rescue the wicked.
17468	21	8	9	‡While applying my mind to everything that happens in this world, I have seen all this:‡Sometimes one person dominates other people to their harm.
17469	21	8	10	‡Not only that, but I have seen the wicked approaching and entering the temple, ‡and as they left the holy temple, they ‡boasted in the city that they had done so.‡This also is an enigma.
17470	21	8	11	‡When a sentence is not executed at once against a crime, ‡the human heart is encouraged to do evil.
17471	21	8	12	‡Even though a sinner might commit a hundred crimes and still live a long time, ‡yet I know that it will go well with God-fearing people – for they stand in fear before him.
17472	21	8	13	‡But it will not go well with the wicked,‡nor will they prolong their days like a shadow, ‡because they do not stand in fear before God.
17473	21	8	14	‡Here is another enigma that occurs on earth:‡Sometimes there are righteous people who get what the wicked deserve, ‡and sometimes there are wicked people who get what the righteous deserve. ‡I said, “This also is an enigma.”
17474	21	8	15	‡So I recommend the enjoyment of life, ‡for there is nothing better on earth for a person to do except to eat, drink, and enjoy life. ‡So joy will accompany him in his toil‡during the days of his life which God gives him on earth.
17475	21	8	16	‡When I tried to gain wisdom‡and to observe the activity on earth – ‡even though it prevents anyone from sleeping day or night –
17476	21	8	17	‡then I discerned all that God has done: ‡No one really comprehends what happens on earth. ‡Despite all human efforts to discover it, no one can ever grasp it. ‡Even if a wise person claimed that he understood,‡he would not really comprehend it.
17477	21	9	1	‡So I reflected on all this, attempting to clear it all up.‡I concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their works, are in the hand of God;‡whether a person will be loved or hated – ‡no one knows what lies ahead.
17478	21	9	2	‡Everyone shares the same fate – ‡the righteous and the wicked,‡the good and the bad, ‡the ceremonially clean and unclean,‡those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.‡What happens to the good person, also happens to the sinner; ‡what happens to those who make vows, also happens to those who are afraid to make vows.
17479	21	9	3	‡This is the unfortunate fact about everything that happens on earth: ‡the same fate awaits everyone.‡In addition to this, the hearts of all people are full of evil,‡and there is folly in their hearts during their lives – then they die.
17480	21	9	4	‡But whoever is among the living has hope;‡a live dog is better than a dead lion.
17481	21	9	5	‡For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything;‡they have no further reward – and even the memory of them disappears.
17482	21	9	6	‡What they loved, as well as what they hated and envied, perished long ago,‡and they no longer have a part in anything that happens on earth.
17483	21	9	7	‡Go, eat your food with joy,‡and drink your wine with a happy heart,‡because God has already approved your works.
17484	21	9	8	‡Let your clothes always be white,‡and do not spare precious ointment on your head.
17485	21	9	9	‡Enjoy life with your beloved wife during all the days of your fleeting life‡that God has given you on earth during all your fleeting days; ‡for that is your reward in life and in your burdensome work on earth.
17486	21	9	10	‡Whatever you find to do with your hands, ‡do it with all your might,‡because there is neither work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave, ‡the place where you will eventually go.
17487	21	9	11	‡Again, I observed this on the earth: ‡the race is not always won by the swiftest,‡the battle is not always won by the strongest;‡prosperity does not always belong to those who are the wisest,‡wealth does not always belong to those who are the most discerning,‡nor does success always come to those with the most knowledge – ‡for time and chance may overcome them all.
17488	21	9	12	‡Surely, no one knows his appointed time! ‡Like fish that are caught in a deadly net, and like birds that are caught in a snare – ‡just like them, all people are ensnared at an unfortunate time that falls upon them suddenly.
17489	21	9	13	‡This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth, ‡and it is a great burden to me:
17490	21	9	14	‡There was once a small city with a few men in it,‡and a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it.
17491	21	9	15	‡However, a poor but wise man lived in the city, ‡and he could have delivered the city by his wisdom,‡but no one listened to that poor man.
17492	21	9	16	‡So I concluded that wisdom is better than might, ‡but a poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.
17493	21	9	17	‡The words of the wise are heard in quiet,‡more than the shouting of a ruler is heard among fools.
17494	21	9	18	‡Wisdom is better than weapons of war,‡but one sinner can destroy much that is good.
17495	21	10	1	‡One dead fly makes the perfumer’s ointment give off a rancid stench, ‡so a little folly can outweigh much wisdom.
17496	21	10	2	‡A wise person’s good sense protects him, ‡but a fool’s lack of sense leaves him vulnerable.
17497	21	10	3	‡Even when a fool walks along the road he lacks sense, ‡and shows everyone what a fool he is.
17498	21	10	4	‡If the anger of the ruler flares up against you, do not resign from your position, ‡for a calm response can undo great offenses.
17499	21	10	5	‡I have seen another misfortune on the earth: ‡It is an error a ruler makes.
17500	21	10	6	‡Fools are placed in many positions of authority, ‡while wealthy men sit in lowly positions.
17501	21	10	7	‡I have seen slaves on horseback‡and princes walking on foot like slaves.
17502	21	10	8	‡One who digs a pit may fall into it,‡and one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
17503	21	10	9	‡One who quarries stones may be injured by them;‡one who splits logs may be endangered by them.
17504	21	10	10	‡If an iron axhead is blunt and a workman does not sharpen its edge, ‡he must exert a great deal of effort; ‡so wisdom has the advantage of giving success.
17505	21	10	11	‡If the snake should bite before it is charmed, ‡the snake charmer is in trouble.
17506	21	10	12	‡The words of a wise person win him favor, ‡but the words of a fool are self-destructive.
17507	21	10	13	‡At the beginning his words are foolish‡and at the end his talk is wicked madness,
17508	21	10	14	‡yet a fool keeps on babbling. ‡No one knows what will happen;‡who can tell him what will happen in the future?
17509	21	10	15	‡The toil of a stupid fool wears him out, ‡because he does not even know the way to the city.
17510	21	10	16	‡Woe to you, O land, when your king is childish, ‡and your princes feast in the morning!
17511	21	10	17	‡Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobility, ‡and your princes feast at the proper time – with self-control and not in drunkenness.
17512	21	10	18	‡Because of laziness the roof caves in,‡and because of idle hands the house leaks.
17513	21	10	19	‡Feasts are made for laughter,‡and wine makes life merry, ‡but money is the answer for everything.
17514	21	10	20	‡Do not curse a king even in your thoughts,‡and do not curse the rich while in your bedroom; ‡for a bird might report what you are thinking, ‡or some winged creature might repeat your words.
17515	21	11	1	‡Send your grain overseas, ‡for after many days you will get a return.
17516	21	11	2	‡Divide your merchandise among seven or even eight investments, ‡for you do not know what calamity may happen on earth.
17517	21	11	3	‡If the clouds are full of rain, they will empty themselves on the earth,‡and whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, the tree will lie wherever it falls.
17518	21	11	4	‡He who watches the wind will not sow,‡and he who observes the clouds will not reap.
17519	21	11	5	‡Just as you do not know the path of the wind,‡or how the bones form in the womb of a pregnant woman, ‡so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
17520	21	11	6	‡Sow your seed in the morning,‡and do not stop working until the evening; ‡for you do not know which activity will succeed – ‡whether this one or that one, or whether both will prosper equally.
17521	21	11	7	‡Light is sweet, ‡and it is pleasant for a person to see the sun.
17522	21	11	8	‡So, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all,‡but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many – all that is about to come is obscure.
17523	21	11	9	‡Rejoice, young man, while you are young, ‡and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth.‡Follow the impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes,‡but know that God will judge your motives and actions.
17524	21	11	10	‡Banish emotional stress from your mind. ‡and put away pain from your body; ‡for youth and the prime of life are fleeting.
17525	21	12	1	‡So remember your Creator in the days of your youth – ‡before the difficult days come,‡and the years draw near when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;
17526	21	12	2	‡before the sun and the light of the moon and the stars grow dark,‡and the clouds disappear after the rain;
17527	21	12	3	‡when those who keep watch over the house begin to tremble, ‡and the virile men begin to stoop over, ‡and the grinders begin to cease because they grow few,‡and those who look through the windows grow dim,
17528	21	12	4	‡and the doors along the street are shut;‡when the sound of the grinding mill grows low,‡and one is awakened by the sound of a bird,‡and all their songs grow faint,
17529	21	12	5	‡and they are afraid of heights and the dangers in the street;‡the almond blossoms grow white, ‡and the grasshopper drags itself along, ‡and the caper berry shrivels up – ‡because man goes to his eternal home, ‡and the mourners go about in the streets –
17530	21	12	6	‡before the silver cord is removed,‡or the golden bowl is broken,‡or the pitcher is shattered at the well, ‡or the water wheel is broken at the cistern –
17531	21	12	7	‡and the dust returns to the earth as it was,‡and the life’s breath returns to God who gave it.
17532	21	12	8	‡“Absolutely futile!” laments the Teacher, ‡“All of these things are futile!”
17533	21	12	9	‡Not only was the Teacher wise, ‡but he also taught knowledge to the people;‡he carefully evaluated and arranged many proverbs.
17534	21	12	10	‡The Teacher sought to find delightful words,‡and to write accurately truthful sayings.
17535	21	12	11	‡The words of the sages are like prods, ‡and the collected sayings are like firmly fixed nails;‡they are given by one shepherd.
17536	21	12	12	‡Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. ‡There is no end to the making of many books,‡and much study is exhausting to the body.
17537	21	12	13	‡Having heard everything, I have reached this conclusion: ‡Fear God and keep his commandments,‡because this is the whole duty of man.
17538	21	12	14	‡For God will evaluate every deed, ‡including every secret thing, whether good or evil.
17539	22	1	1	‡Solomon’s Most Excellent Love Song.
17540	22	1	2	‡Oh, how I wish you would kiss me passionately! ‡For your lovemaking is more delightful than wine.
17541	22	1	3	‡The fragrance of your colognes is delightful; ‡your name is like the finest perfume. ‡No wonder the young women adore you!
17542	22	1	4	‡Draw me after you; let us hurry! ‡May the king bring me into his bedroom chambers! ‡We will rejoice and delight in you; ‡we will praise your love more than wine.‡How rightly the young women adore you!
17543	22	1	5	‡I am dark but lovely, O maidens of Jerusalem,‡dark like the tents of Qedar, ‡lovely like the tent curtains of Salmah.
17544	22	1	6	‡Do not stare at me because I am dark,‡for the sun has burned my skin. ‡My brothers were angry with me;‡they made me the keeper of the vineyards.‡Alas, my own vineyard I could not keep!
17545	22	1	7	‡Tell me, O you whom my heart loves,‡where do you pasture your sheep?‡Where do you rest your sheep during the midday heat?‡Tell me lest I wander around ‡beside the flocks of your companions!
17546	22	1	8	‡If you do not know, O most beautiful of women,‡simply follow the tracks of my flock,‡and pasture your little lambs‡beside the tents of the shepherds.
17547	22	1	9	‡O my beloved, you are like a mare ‡among Pharaoh’s stallions.
17548	22	1	10	‡Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments;‡your neck is lovely with strings of jewels.
17549	22	1	11	‡We will make for you gold ornaments‡studded with silver.
17550	22	1	12	‡While the king was at his banqueting table, ‡my nard gave forth its fragrance.
17551	22	1	13	‡My beloved is like a fragrant pouch of myrrh ‡spending the night between my breasts.
17552	22	1	14	‡My beloved is like a cluster of henna blossoms ‡in the vineyards of En Gedi.
17553	22	1	15	‡Oh, how beautiful you are, my beloved! ‡Oh, how beautiful you are!‡Your eyes are like doves!
17554	22	1	16	‡Oh, how handsome you are, my lover! ‡Oh, how delightful you are!‡The lush foliage is our canopied bed;
17555	22	1	17	‡the cedars are the beams of our bedroom chamber;‡the pines are the rafters of our bedroom.
17556	22	2	1	‡I am a meadow flower from Sharon, ‡a lily from the valleys.
17557	22	2	2	‡Like a lily among the thorns, ‡so is my darling among the maidens.
17558	22	2	3	‡Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,‡so is my beloved among the young men.‡I delight to sit in his shade, ‡and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
17559	22	2	4	‡He brought me into the banquet hall, ‡and he looked at me lovingly.
17560	22	2	5	‡Sustain me with raisin cakes, ‡refresh me with apples, ‡for I am faint with love. ‡<i>The Double Refrain: Embracing and Adjuration</i>
17561	22	2	6	‡His left hand is under my head, ‡and his right hand embraces me.
17562	22	2	7	‡I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem,‡by the gazelles and by the young does of the open fields: ‡Do not awaken or arouse love until it pleases!
17563	22	2	8	‡Listen! My lover is approaching! ‡Look! Here he comes,‡leaping over the mountains,‡bounding over the hills!
17564	22	2	9	‡My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. ‡Look! There he stands behind our wall,‡gazing through the window,‡peering through the lattice.
17565	22	2	10	‡My lover spoke to me, saying:‡“Arise, my darling;‡My beautiful one, come away with me!
17566	22	2	11	‡Look! The winter has passed,‡the winter rains are over and gone.
17567	22	2	12	‡Blossoms have appeared in the land,‡the time for pruning and singing has come;‡the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
17568	22	2	13	‡The fig tree has ripened its figs,‡the vines have blossomed and give off their fragrance.‡Arise, come away my darling;‡my beautiful one, come away with me!”
17569	22	2	14	‡O my dove, in the clefts of the rock,‡in the hiding places of the mountain crags,‡let me see your face,‡let me hear your voice;‡for your voice is sweet,‡and your face is lovely.
17570	22	2	15	‡Catch the foxes for us,‡the little foxes, ‡that ruin the vineyards – ‡for our vineyard is in bloom.
17571	22	2	16	‡My lover is mine and I am his;‡he grazes among the lilies.
17572	22	2	17	‡Until the dawn arrives and the shadows flee,‡turn, my beloved – ‡be like a gazelle or a young stag‡on the mountain gorges.
17573	22	3	1	‡All night long on my bed ‡I longed for my lover. ‡I longed for him but he never appeared.
17574	22	3	2	‡“I will arise and look all around throughout the town,‡and throughout the streets and squares;‡I will search for my beloved.”‡I searched for him but I did not find him.
17575	22	3	3	‡The night watchmen found me – the ones who guard the city walls. ‡“Have you seen my beloved?”
17576	22	3	4	‡Scarcely had I passed them by‡when I found my beloved!‡I held onto him tightly and would not let him go ‡until I brought him to my mother’s house, ‡to the bedroom chamber of the one who conceived me.
17577	22	3	5	‡I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem,‡by the gazelles and by the young does of the open fields:‡“Do not awake or arouse love until it pleases!”
17578	22	3	6	‡Who is this coming up from the wilderness‡like a column of smoke,‡like a fragrant billow of myrrh and frankincense, ‡every kind of fragrant powder of the traveling merchants?
17579	22	3	7	‡Look! It is Solomon’s portable couch! ‡It is surrounded by sixty warriors,‡some of Israel’s mightiest warriors.
17580	22	3	8	‡All of them are skilled with a sword, ‡well-trained in the art of warfare. ‡Each has his sword at his side,‡to guard against the terrors of the night.
17581	22	3	9	‡King Solomon made a sedan chair for himself‡of wood imported from Lebanon.
17582	22	3	10	‡Its posts were made of silver; ‡its back was made of gold.‡Its seat was upholstered with purple wool; ‡its interior was inlaid with leather by the maidens of Jerusalem.
17583	22	3	11	‡Come out, O maidens of Zion,‡and gaze upon King Solomon!‡He is wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him‡on his wedding day,‡on the most joyous day of his life!
17584	22	4	1	‡Oh, you are beautiful, my darling! ‡Oh, you are beautiful!‡Your eyes behind your veil are like doves. ‡Your hair is like a flock of female goats‡descending from Mount Gilead.
17585	22	4	2	‡Your teeth are like a flock of newly-shorn sheep‡coming up from the washing place; ‡each of them has a twin,‡and not one of them is missing.
17586	22	4	3	‡Your lips are like a scarlet thread; ‡your mouth is lovely.‡Your forehead behind your veil‡is like a slice of pomegranate.
17587	22	4	4	‡Your neck is like the tower of David‡built with courses of stones; ‡one thousand shields are hung on it – ‡all shields of valiant warriors.
17588	22	4	5	‡Your two breasts are like two fawns,‡twins of the gazelle‡grazing among the lilies.
17589	22	4	6	‡Until the dawn arrives ‡and the shadows flee,‡I will go up to the mountain of myrrh,‡and to the hill of frankincense.
17590	22	4	7	‡You are altogether beautiful, my darling!‡There is no blemish in you!
17591	22	4	8	‡Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,‡come with me from Lebanon.‡Descend from the crest of Amana,‡from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon,‡from the lions’ dens‡and the mountain haunts of the leopards.
17592	22	4	9	‡You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride!‡You have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes, ‡with one jewel of your necklace.
17593	22	4	10	‡How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride!‡How much better is your love than wine;‡the fragrance of your perfume is better than any spice!
17594	22	4	11	‡Your lips drip sweetness like the honeycomb, my bride,‡honey and milk are under your tongue.‡The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
17595	22	4	12	‡You are a locked garden, my sister, my bride;‡you are an enclosed spring, a sealed-up fountain.
17596	22	4	13	‡Your shoots are a royal garden full of pomegranates‡with choice fruits:‡henna with nard,
17597	22	4	14	‡nard and saffron;‡calamus and cinnamon with every kind of spice,‡myrrh and aloes with all the finest spices.
17598	22	4	15	‡You are a garden spring, ‡a well of fresh water flowing down from Lebanon.
17599	22	4	16	‡Awake, O north wind; come, O south wind!‡Blow on my garden so that its fragrant spices may send out their sweet smell. ‡May my beloved come into his garden‡and eat its delightful fruit!
17600	22	5	1	‡I have entered my garden, O my sister, my bride;‡I have gathered my myrrh with my balsam spice.‡I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;‡I have drunk my wine and my milk!‡Eat, friends, and drink! ‡Drink freely, O lovers!
17601	22	5	2	‡I was asleep, but my mind was dreaming. ‡Listen! My lover is knocking at the door! ‡“Open for me, my sister, my darling,‡my dove, my flawless one!‡My head is drenched with dew,‡my hair with the dampness of the night.”
17602	22	5	3	‡“I have already taken off my robe – must I put it on again?‡I have already washed my feet – must I soil them again?”
17603	22	5	4	‡My lover thrust his hand through the hole, ‡and my feelings were stirred for him.
17604	22	5	5	‡I arose to open for my beloved;‡my hands dripped with myrrh – ‡my fingers flowed with myrrh‡on the handles of the lock.
17605	22	5	6	‡I opened for my beloved,‡but my lover had already turned and gone away. ‡I fell into despair when he departed. ‡I looked for him but did not find him;‡I called him but he did not answer me.
17606	22	5	7	‡The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city.‡They beat me, they bruised me;‡they took away my cloak, those watchmen on the walls!
17607	22	5	8	‡I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem – ‡If you find my beloved, what will you tell him?‡Tell him that I am lovesick!
17608	22	5	9	‡Why is your beloved better than others, ‡O most beautiful of women?‡Why is your beloved better than others,‡that you would admonish us in this manner?
17609	22	5	10	‡My beloved is dazzling and ruddy; ‡he stands out in comparison to all other men.
17610	22	5	11	‡His head is like the purest gold. ‡His hair is curly – black like a raven.
17611	22	5	12	‡His eyes are like doves by streams of water,‡washed in milk, mounted like jewels.
17612	22	5	13	‡His cheeks are like garden beds full of balsam trees yielding perfume.‡His lips are like lilies dripping with drops of myrrh.
17613	22	5	14	‡His arms are like rods of gold set with chrysolite.‡His abdomen is like polished ivory inlaid with sapphires.
17614	22	5	15	‡His legs are like pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold.‡His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars.
17615	22	5	16	‡His mouth is very sweet; ‡he is totally desirable. ‡This is my beloved!‡This is my companion, O maidens of Jerusalem!
17616	22	6	1	‡Where has your beloved gone,‡O most beautiful among women?‡Where has your beloved turned?‡Tell us, that we may seek him with you.
17617	22	6	2	‡My beloved has gone down to his garden, ‡to the flowerbeds of balsam spices, ‡to graze in the gardens,‡and to gather lilies.
17618	22	6	3	‡I am my lover’s and my lover is mine; ‡he grazes among the lilies.
17619	22	6	4	‡My darling, you are as beautiful as Tirzah, ‡as lovely as Jerusalem, ‡as awe-inspiring as bannered armies!
17620	22	6	5	‡Turn your eyes away from me – ‡they overwhelm me!‡Your hair is like a flock of goats‡descending from Mount Gilead.
17621	22	6	6	‡Your teeth are like a flock of sheep‡coming up from the washing;‡each has its twin;‡not one of them is missing.
17622	22	6	7	‡Like a slice of pomegranate‡is your forehead behind your veil.
17623	22	6	8	‡There may be sixty queens,‡and eighty concubines,‡and young women without number.
17624	22	6	9	‡But she is unique! ‡My dove, my perfect one!‡She is the special daughter of her mother,‡she is the favorite of the one who bore her.‡The maidens saw her and complimented her; ‡the queens and concubines praised her:
17625	22	6	10	‡“Who is this who appears like the dawn? ‡Beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun,‡awe-inspiring as the stars in procession?”
17626	22	6	11	‡I went down to the orchard of walnut trees, ‡to look for the blossoms of the valley, ‡to see if the vines had budded‡or if the pomegranates were in bloom.
17627	22	6	12	‡I was beside myself with joy! ‡There please give me your myrrh, ‡O daughter of my princely people.
17628	22	6	13	‡(7:1) Turn, turn, O Perfect One! ‡Turn, turn, that I may stare at you!‡Why do you gaze upon the Perfect One‡like the dance of the Mahanaim?
17629	22	7	1	‡(7:2) How beautiful are your sandaled feet,‡O nobleman’s daughter! ‡The curves of your thighs are like jewels,‡the work of the hands of a master craftsman.
17630	22	7	2	‡Your navel is a round mixing bowl – ‡may it never lack mixed wine! ‡Your belly is a mound of wheat,‡encircled by lilies.
17631	22	7	3	‡Your two breasts are like two fawns,‡twins of a gazelle.
17632	22	7	4	‡Your neck is like a tower made of ivory. ‡Your eyes are the pools in Heshbon‡by the gate of Bath-Rabbim. ‡Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon‡overlooking Damascus.
17633	22	7	5	‡Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel. ‡The locks of your hair are like royal tapestries – ‡the king is held captive in its tresses!
17634	22	7	6	‡How beautiful you are! How lovely,‡O love, with your delights!
17635	22	7	7	‡Your stature is like a palm tree, ‡and your breasts are like clusters of grapes.
17636	22	7	8	‡I want to climb the palm tree, ‡and take hold of its fruit stalks.‡May your breasts be like the clusters of grapes, ‡and may the fragrance of your breath be like apples!
17637	22	7	9	‡May your mouth be like the best wine,‡flowing smoothly for my beloved,‡gliding gently over our lips as we sleep together.
17638	22	7	10	‡I am my beloved’s,‡and he desires me!
17639	22	7	11	‡Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside;‡let us spend the night in the villages.
17640	22	7	12	‡Let us rise early to go to the vineyards,‡to see if the vines have budded,‡to see if their blossoms have opened,‡if the pomegranates are in bloom – ‡there I will give you my love.
17641	22	7	13	‡The mandrakes send out their fragrance;‡over our door is every delicacy, ‡both new and old, which I have stored up for you, my lover.
17642	22	8	1	‡Oh, how I wish you were my little brother, ‡nursing at my mother’s breasts;‡if I saw you outside, I could kiss you – ‡surely no one would despise me!
17643	22	8	2	‡I would lead you and bring you to my mother’s house,‡the one who taught me. ‡I would give you spiced wine to drink, ‡the nectar of my pomegranates.
17644	22	8	3	‡His left hand is under my head,‡and his right hand embraces me.
17645	22	8	4	‡I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem:‡“Do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases!”
17646	22	8	5	‡Who is this coming up from the wilderness,‡leaning on her beloved?‡Under the apple tree I aroused you; ‡there your mother conceived you,‡there she who bore you was in labor of childbirth.
17647	22	8	6	‡Set me like a cylinder seal over your heart, ‡like a signet on your arm. ‡For love is as strong as death, ‡passion is as unrelenting as Sheol.‡Its flames burst forth, ‡it is a blazing flame.
17648	22	8	7	‡Surging waters cannot quench love;‡floodwaters cannot overflow it.‡If someone were to offer all his possessions to buy love, ‡the offer would be utterly despised.
17649	22	8	8	‡We have a little sister,‡and as yet she has no breasts.‡What shall we do for our sister‡on the day when she is spoken for?
17650	22	8	9	‡If she is a wall, ‡we will build on her a battlement of silver;‡but if she is a door,‡we will barricade her with boards of cedar.
17651	22	8	10	‡I was a wall,‡and my breasts were like fortress towers. ‡Then I found favor in his eyes.
17652	22	8	11	‡Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-Hamon;‡he leased out the vineyard to those who maintained it.‡Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.
17653	22	8	12	‡My vineyard, which belongs to me, is at my disposal alone. ‡The thousand shekels belong to you, O Solomon,‡and two hundred shekels belong to those who maintain it for its fruit.
17654	22	8	13	‡O you who stay in the gardens,‡my companions are listening attentively for your voice;‡let me be the one to hear it!
17655	22	8	14	‡Make haste, my beloved!‡Be like a gazelle or a young stag‡on the mountains of spices.
17656	23	1	1	¶Here is the message about Judah and Jerusalem that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah reigned over Judah.
17657	23	1	2	‡Listen, O heavens,‡pay attention, O earth! ‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> speaks:‡“I raised children, I brought them up, ‡but they have rebelled against me!
17658	23	1	3	‡An ox recognizes its owner,‡a donkey recognizes where its owner puts its food; ‡but Israel does not recognize me, ‡my people do not understand.”
17659	23	1	4	‡Beware sinful nation, ‡the people weighed down by evil deeds.‡They are offspring who do wrong,‡children who do wicked things.‡They have abandoned the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡and rejected the Holy One of Israel. ‡They are alienated from him.
17660	23	1	5	‡Why do you insist on being battered?‡Why do you continue to rebel? ‡Your head has a massive wound, ‡your whole heart is sick.
17661	23	1	6	‡From the soles of your feet to your head,‡there is no spot that is unharmed. ‡There are only bruises, cuts,‡and open wounds.‡They have not been cleansed or bandaged,‡nor have they been treated with olive oil.
17662	23	1	7	‡Your land is devastated,‡your cities burned with fire.‡Right before your eyes your crops‡are being destroyed by foreign invaders. ‡They leave behind devastation and destruction.
17663	23	1	8	‡Daughter Zion is left isolated,‡like a hut in a vineyard,‡or a shelter in a cucumber field;‡she is a besieged city.
17664	23	1	9	‡If the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies had not left us a few survivors,‡we would have quickly been like Sodom, ‡we would have become like Gomorrah.
17665	23	1	10	‡Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message,‡you leaders of Sodom! ‡Pay attention to our God’s rebuke, ‡people of Gomorrah!
17666	23	1	11	‡“Of what importance to me are your many sacrifices?” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“I have had my fill of burnt sacrifices‡of rams and the fat from steers.‡The blood of bulls, lambs, and goats‡I do not want.
17667	23	1	12	‡When you enter my presence,‡do you actually think I want this – ‡animals trampling on my courtyards?
17668	23	1	13	‡Do not bring any more meaningless offerings;‡I consider your incense detestable! ‡You observe new moon festivals, Sabbaths, and convocations,‡but I cannot tolerate sin-stained celebrations!
17669	23	1	14	‡I hate your new moon festivals and assemblies;‡they are a burden‡that I am tired of carrying.
17670	23	1	15	‡When you spread out your hands in prayer,‡I look the other way; ‡when you offer your many prayers,‡I do not listen,‡because your hands are covered with blood.
17671	23	1	16	‡Wash! Cleanse yourselves!‡Remove your sinful deeds ‡from my sight.‡Stop sinning!
17672	23	1	17	‡Learn to do what is right!‡Promote justice!‡Give the oppressed reason to celebrate! ‡Take up the cause of the orphan!‡Defend the rights of the widow!
17673	23	1	18	‡Come, let’s consider your options,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“Though your sins have stained you like the color red,‡you can become white like snow;‡though they are as easy to see as the color scarlet,‡you can become white like wool.
17674	23	1	19	‡If you have a willing attitude and obey, ‡then you will again eat the good crops of the land.
17675	23	1	20	‡But if you refuse and rebel,‡you will be devoured by the sword.”‡Know for certain that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken.
17676	23	1	21	‡How tragic that the once-faithful city‡has become a prostitute! ‡She was once a center of justice,‡fairness resided in her,‡but now only murderers.
17677	23	1	22	‡Your silver has become scum, ‡your beer is diluted with water.
17678	23	1	23	‡Your officials are rebels, ‡they associate with thieves.‡All of them love bribery,‡and look for payoffs. ‡They do not take up the cause of the orphan, ‡or defend the rights of the widow.
17679	23	1	24	‡Therefore, the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‡the Powerful One of Israel, says this:‡“Ah, I will seek vengeance against my adversaries,‡I will take revenge against my enemies.
17680	23	1	25	‡I will attack you; ‡I will purify your metal with flux. ‡I will remove all your slag.
17681	23	1	26	‡I will reestablish honest judges as in former times,‡wise advisers as in earlier days. ‡Then you will be called, ‘The Just City,‡Faithful Town.’”
17682	23	1	27	‡Zion will be freed by justice, ‡and her returnees by righteousness.
17683	23	1	28	‡All rebellious sinners will be shattered, ‡those who abandon the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will perish.
17684	23	1	29	‡Indeed, they will be ashamed of the sacred trees‡you find so desirable;‡you will be embarrassed because of the sacred orchards ‡where you choose to worship.
17685	23	1	30	‡For you will be like a tree whose leaves wither,‡like an orchard that is unwatered.
17686	23	1	31	‡The powerful will be like a thread of yarn,‡their deeds like a spark;‡both will burn together,‡and no one will put out the fire.
17687	23	2	1	¶Here is the message about Judah and Jerusalem that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz.
17688	23	2	2	‡In the future ‡the mountain of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple will endure ‡as the most important of mountains,‡and will be the most prominent of hills. ‡All the nations will stream to it,
17689	23	2	3	‡many peoples will come and say,‡“Come, let us go up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s mountain,‡to the temple of the God of Jacob,‡so he can teach us his requirements, ‡and we can follow his standards.” ‡For Zion will be the center for moral instruction; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message will issue from Jerusalem.
17690	23	2	4	‡He will judge disputes between nations;‡he will settle cases for many peoples.‡They will beat their swords into plowshares, ‡and their spears into pruning hooks. ‡Nations will not take up the sword against other nations,‡and they will no longer train for war.
17691	23	2	5	‡O descendants of Jacob,‡come, let us walk in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s guiding light.
17692	23	2	6	‡Indeed, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you have abandoned your people,‡the descendants of Jacob.‡For diviners from the east are everywhere; ‡they consult omen readers like the Philistines do. ‡Plenty of foreigners are around.
17693	23	2	7	‡Their land is full of gold and silver;‡there is no end to their wealth. ‡Their land is full of horses;‡there is no end to their chariots.
17694	23	2	8	‡Their land is full of worthless idols;‡they worship the product of their own hands,‡what their own fingers have fashioned.
17695	23	2	9	‡Men bow down to them in homage,‡they lie flat on the ground in worship. ‡Don’t spare them!
17696	23	2	10	‡Go up into the rocky cliffs,‡hide in the ground.‡Get away from the dreadful judgment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡from his royal splendor!
17697	23	2	11	‡Proud men will be brought low,‡arrogant men will be humiliated; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> alone will be exalted ‡in that day.
17698	23	2	12	‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has planned a day of judgment, ‡for all the high and mighty,‡for all who are proud – they will be humiliated;
17699	23	2	13	‡for all the cedars of Lebanon,‡that are so high and mighty,‡for all the oaks of Bashan;
17700	23	2	14	‡for all the tall mountains,‡for all the high hills,
17701	23	2	15	‡for every high tower,‡for every fortified wall,
17702	23	2	16	‡for all the large ships, ‡for all the impressive ships.
17703	23	2	17	‡Proud men will be humiliated,‡arrogant men will be brought low; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> alone will be exalted ‡in that day.
17704	23	2	18	‡The worthless idols will be completely eliminated.
17705	23	2	19	‡They will go into caves in the rocky cliffs‡and into holes in the ground, ‡trying to escape the dreadful judgment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> ‡and his royal splendor,‡when he rises up to terrify the earth.
17706	23	2	20	‡At that time men will throw ‡their silver and gold idols,‡which they made for themselves to worship, ‡into the caves where rodents and bats live,
17707	23	2	21	‡so they themselves can go into the crevices of the rocky cliffs‡and the openings under the rocky overhangs, ‡trying to escape the dreadful judgment of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> ‡and his royal splendor,‡when he rises up to terrify the earth.
17708	23	2	22	‡Stop trusting in human beings,‡whose life’s breath is in their nostrils.‡For why should they be given special consideration?
17709	23	3	1	‡Look, the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies ‡is about to remove from Jerusalem and Judah‡every source of security, including ‡all the food and water,
17710	23	3	2	‡the mighty men and warriors,‡judges and prophets,‡omen readers and leaders,
17711	23	3	3	‡captains of groups of fifty,‡the respected citizens, ‡advisers and those skilled in magical arts, ‡and those who know incantations.
17712	23	3	4	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “I will make youths their officials;‡malicious young men will rule over them.
17713	23	3	5	‡The people will treat each other harshly;‡men will oppose each other;‡neighbors will fight. ‡Youths will proudly defy the elderly‡and riffraff will challenge those who were once respected.
17714	23	3	6	‡Indeed, a man will grab his brother‡right in his father’s house and say, ‡‘You own a coat – ‡you be our leader!‡This heap of ruins will be under your control.’
17715	23	3	7	‡At that time the brother will shout, ‡‘I am no doctor, ‡I have no food or coat in my house;‡don’t make me a leader of the people!’”
17716	23	3	8	‡Jerusalem certainly stumbles,‡Judah falls,‡for their words and their actions offend the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; ‡they rebel against his royal authority.
17717	23	3	9	‡The look on their faces testifies to their guilt; ‡like the people of Sodom they openly boast of their sin. ‡Woe to them! ‡For they bring disaster on themselves.
17718	23	3	10	‡Tell the innocent it will go well with them, ‡for they will be rewarded for what they have done.
17719	23	3	11	‡Woe to the wicked sinners!‡For they will get exactly what they deserve.
17720	23	3	12	‡Oppressors treat my people cruelly;‡creditors rule over them. ‡My people’s leaders mislead them;‡they give you confusing directions.
17721	23	3	13	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> takes his position to judge;‡he stands up to pass sentence on his people.
17722	23	3	14	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> comes to pronounce judgment ‡on the leaders of his people and their officials.‡He says, “It is you who have ruined the vineyard! ‡You have stashed in your houses what you have stolen from the poor.
17723	23	3	15	‡Why do you crush my people‡and grind the faces of the poor?” ‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has spoken.
17724	23	3	16	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“The women of Zion are proud.‡They walk with their heads high ‡and flirt with their eyes.‡They skip along ‡and the jewelry on their ankles jingles.
17725	23	3	17	‡So the Lord will afflict the foreheads of Zion’s women with skin diseases; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will make the front of their heads bald.”
17726	23	3	18	¶At that time the Lord will remove their beautiful ankle jewelry, neck ornaments, crescent shaped ornaments,
17727	23	3	19	earrings, bracelets, veils,
17728	23	3	20	headdresses, ankle ornaments, sashes, sachets, amulets,
17729	23	3	21	rings, nose rings,
17730	23	3	22	festive dresses, robes, shawls, purses,
17731	23	3	23	garments, vests, head coverings, and gowns.
17732	23	3	24	‡A putrid stench will replace the smell of spices, ‡a rope will replace a belt,‡baldness will replace braided locks of hair,‡a sackcloth garment will replace a fine robe,‡and a prisoner’s brand will replace beauty.
17733	23	3	25	‡Your men will fall by the sword,‡your strong men will die in battle.
17734	23	3	26	‡Her gates will mourn and lament;‡deprived of her people, she will sit on the ground.
17735	23	4	1	‡Seven women will grab hold of‡one man at that time. ‡They will say, “We will provide our own food,‡we will provide our own clothes;‡but let us belong to you – ‡take away our shame!”
17736	23	4	2	‡At that time ‡the crops given by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will bring admiration and honor; ‡the produce of the land will be a source of pride and delight ‡to those who remain in Israel.
17737	23	4	3	‡Those remaining in Zion, those left in Jerusalem, ‡will be called “holy,” ‡all in Jerusalem who are destined to live.
17738	23	4	4	‡At that time the Lord will wash the excrement from Zion’s women, ‡he will rinse the bloodstains from Jerusalem’s midst, ‡as he comes to judge‡and to bring devastation.
17739	23	4	5	‡Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will create‡over all of Mount Zion ‡and over its convocations‡a cloud and smoke by day‡and a bright flame of fire by night; ‡indeed a canopy will accompany the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s glorious presence.
17740	23	4	6	‡By day it will be a shelter to provide shade from the heat,‡as well as safety and protection from the heavy downpour.
17741	23	5	1	‡I will sing to my love – ‡a song to my lover about his vineyard. ‡My love had a vineyard‡on a fertile hill.
17742	23	5	2	‡He built a hedge around it, removed its stones,‡and planted a vine.‡He built a tower in the middle of it,‡and constructed a winepress.‡He waited for it to produce edible grapes,‡but it produced sour ones instead.
17743	23	5	3	‡So now, residents of Jerusalem, ‡people of Judah,‡you decide between me and my vineyard!
17744	23	5	4	‡What more can I do for my vineyard‡beyond what I have already done?‡When I waited for it to produce edible grapes,‡why did it produce sour ones instead?
17745	23	5	5	‡Now I will inform you‡what I am about to do to my vineyard:‡I will remove its hedge and turn it into pasture, ‡I will break its wall and allow animals to graze there.
17746	23	5	6	‡I will make it a wasteland;‡no one will prune its vines or hoe its ground, ‡and thorns and briers will grow there.‡I will order the clouds‡not to drop any rain on it.
17747	23	5	7	‡Indeed Israel is the vineyard of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,‡the people of Judah are the cultivated place in which he took delight.‡He waited for justice, but look what he got – disobedience! ‡He waited for fairness, but look what he got – cries for help!
17748	23	5	8	‡Beware, those who accumulate houses, ‡who also accumulate landed property ‡until there is no land left, ‡and you are the only landowners remaining within the land.
17749	23	5	9	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies told me this: ‡“Many houses will certainly become desolate,‡large, impressive houses will have no one living in them.
17750	23	5	10	‡Indeed, a large vineyard will produce just a few gallons, ‡and enough seed to yield several bushels will produce less than a bushel.”
17751	23	5	11	‡Beware, those who get up early to drink beer, ‡those who keep drinking long after dark‡until they are intoxicated with wine.
17752	23	5	12	‡They have stringed instruments, tambourines, flutes,‡and wine at their parties.‡So they do not recognize what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is doing,‡they do not perceive what he is bringing about.
17753	23	5	13	‡Therefore my people will be deported ‡because of their lack of understanding.‡Their leaders will have nothing to eat, ‡their masses will have nothing to drink.
17754	23	5	14	‡So Death will open up its throat,‡and open wide its mouth; ‡Zion’s dignitaries and masses will descend into it,‡including those who revel and celebrate within her.
17755	23	5	15	‡Men will be humiliated,‡they will be brought low;‡the proud will be brought low.
17756	23	5	16	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will be exalted when he punishes, ‡the holy God’s authority will be recognized when he judges.
17757	23	5	17	‡Lambs will graze as if in their pastures,‡amid the ruins the rich sojourners will graze.
17758	23	5	18	‡Beware, those who pull evil along using cords of emptiness are as good as dead, ‡who pull sin as with cart ropes.
17759	23	5	19	‡They say, “Let him hurry, let him act quickly, ‡so we can see;‡let the plan of the Holy One of Israel take shape and come to pass,‡then we will know it!”
17760	23	5	20	‡Beware, those who call evil good and good evil, ‡who turn darkness into light and light into darkness,‡who turn bitter into sweet and sweet into bitter.
17761	23	5	21	‡Beware, those who think they are wise, ‡those who think they possess understanding.
17762	23	5	22	‡Beware, those who are champions at drinking, ‡who display great courage when mixing strong drinks.
17763	23	5	23	‡They pronounce the guilty innocent for a payoff,‡they ignore the just cause of the innocent.
17764	23	5	24	‡Therefore, as flaming fire devours straw,‡and dry grass disintegrates in the flames,‡so their root will rot,‡and their flower will blow away like dust. ‡For they have rejected the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,‡they have spurned the commands of the Holy One of Israel.
17765	23	5	25	‡So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is furious with his people;‡he lifts his hand and strikes them.‡The mountains shake,‡and corpses lie like manure in the middle of the streets.‡Despite all this, his anger does not subside,‡and his hand is ready to strike again.
17766	23	5	26	‡He lifts a signal flag for a distant nation, ‡he whistles for it to come from the far regions of the earth.‡Look, they come quickly and swiftly.
17767	23	5	27	‡None tire or stumble,‡they don’t stop to nap or sleep.‡They don’t loosen their belts,‡or unstrap their sandals to rest.
17768	23	5	28	‡Their arrows are sharpened,‡and all their bows are prepared. ‡The hooves of their horses are hard as flint, ‡and their chariot wheels are like a windstorm.
17769	23	5	29	‡Their roar is like a lion’s;‡they roar like young lions.‡They growl and seize their prey;‡they drag it away and no one can come to the rescue.
17770	23	5	30	‡At that time they will growl over their prey, ‡it will sound like sea waves crashing against rocks. ‡One will look out over the land and see the darkness of disaster,‡clouds will turn the light into darkness.
17771	23	6	1	¶In the year of King Uzziah’s death, I saw the Lord seated on a high, elevated throne. The hem of his robe filled the temple.
17772	23	6	2	Seraphs stood over him; each one had six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and they used the remaining two to fly.
17773	23	6	3	They called out to one another, “Holy, holy, holy is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies! His majestic splendor fills the entire earth!”
17774	23	6	4	The sound of their voices shook the door frames, and the temple was filled with smoke.
17775	23	6	5	¶I said, “Woe to me! I am destroyed, for my lips are contaminated by sin, and I live among people whose lips are contaminated by sin. My eyes have seen the king, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.”
17776	23	6	6	But then one of the seraphs flew toward me. In his hand was a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs.
17777	23	6	7	He touched my mouth with it and said, “Look, this coal has touched your lips. Your evil is removed; your sin is forgiven.”
17778	23	6	8	I heard the voice of the Lord say, “Whom will I send? Who will go on our behalf?” I answered, “Here I am, send me!”
17779	23	6	9	He said, “Go and tell these people:‡‘Listen continually, but don’t understand!‡Look continually, but don’t perceive!’
17780	23	6	10	‡Make the hearts of these people calloused;‡make their ears deaf and their eyes blind!‡Otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears,‡their hearts might understand and they might repent and be healed.”
17781	23	6	11	‡I replied, “How long, Lord?” He said, ‡“Until cities are in ruins and unpopulated,‡and houses are uninhabited, ‡and the land is ruined and devastated,
17782	23	6	12	‡and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent the people off to a distant place,‡and the very heart of the land is completely abandoned.
17783	23	6	13	‡Even if only a tenth of the people remain in the land, it will again be destroyed, like one of the large sacred trees or an Asherah pole, when a sacred pillar on a high place is thrown down. That sacred pillar symbolizes the special chosen family.”
17784	23	7	1	¶During the reign of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel marched up to Jerusalem to do battle, but they were unable to prevail against it.
17785	23	7	2	¶It was reported to the family of David, “Syria has allied with Ephraim.” They and their people were emotionally shaken, just as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
17786	23	7	3	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear-jashub and meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool which is located on the road to the field where they wash and dry cloth.
17787	23	7	4	Tell him, ‘Make sure you stay calm! Don’t be afraid! Don’t be intimidated by these two stubs of smoking logs, or by the raging anger of Rezin, Syria, and the son of Remaliah.
17788	23	7	5	Syria has plotted with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah to bring about your demise.
17789	23	7	6	They say, “Let’s attack Judah, terrorize it, and conquer it. Then we’ll set up the son of Tabeel as its king.”
17790	23	7	7	For this reason the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‡“It will not take place;‡it will not happen.
17791	23	7	8	‡For Syria’s leader is Damascus, ‡and the leader of Damascus is Rezin.‡Within sixty-five years Ephraim will no longer exist as a nation.
17792	23	7	9	‡Ephraim’s leader is Samaria, ‡and Samaria’s leader is the son of Remaliah.‡If your faith does not remain firm, ‡then you will not remain secure.”
17793	23	7	10	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> again spoke to Ahaz:
17794	23	7	11	“Ask for a confirming sign from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. You can even ask for something miraculous.”
17795	23	7	12	But Ahaz responded, “I don’t want to ask; I don’t want to put the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to a test.”
17796	23	7	13	So Isaiah replied, “Pay attention, family of David. Do you consider it too insignificant to try the patience of men? Is that why you are also trying the patience of my God?
17797	23	7	14	For this reason the Lord himself will give you a confirming sign. Look, this young woman is about to conceive and will give birth to a son. You, young woman, will name him Immanuel.
17798	23	7	15	He will eat sour milk and honey, which will help him know how to reject evil and choose what is right.
17799	23	7	16	Here is why this will be so: Before the child knows how to reject evil and choose what is right, the land whose two kings you fear will be desolate.
17800	23	7	17	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will bring on you, your people, and your father’s family a time unlike any since Ephraim departed from Judah – the king of Assyria!”
17801	23	7	18	¶At that time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.
17802	23	7	19	All of them will come and make their home in the ravines between the cliffs, and in the crevices of the cliffs, in all the thorn bushes, and in all the watering holes.
17803	23	7	20	At that time the Lord will use a razor hired from the banks of the Euphrates River, the king of Assyria, to shave the hair off the head and private parts; it will also shave off the beard.
17804	23	7	21	At that time a man will keep alive a young cow from the herd and a couple of goats.
17805	23	7	22	From the abundance of milk they produce, he will have sour milk for his meals. Indeed, everyone left in the heart of the land will eat sour milk and honey.
17806	23	7	23	At that time every place where there had been a thousand vines worth a thousand shekels will be overrun with thorns and briers.
17807	23	7	24	With bow and arrow men will hunt there, for the whole land will be covered with thorns and briers.
17808	23	7	25	They will stay away from all the hills that were cultivated, for fear of the thorns and briers. Cattle will graze there and sheep will trample on them.
17809	23	8	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me, “Take a large tablet and inscribe these words on it with an ordinary stylus: ‘Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.’
17810	23	8	2	Then I will summon as my reliable witnesses Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
17811	23	8	3	I then approached the prophetess for marital relations; she conceived and gave birth to a son. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me, “Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz,
17812	23	8	4	for before the child knows how to cry out, ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”
17813	23	8	5	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to me again:
17814	23	8	6	“These people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and melt in fear over Rezin and the son of Remaliah.
17815	23	8	7	So look, the Lord is bringing up against them the turbulent and mighty waters of the Euphrates River – the king of Assyria and all his majestic power. It will reach flood stage and overflow its banks.
17816	23	8	8	It will spill into Judah, flooding and engulfing, as it reaches to the necks of its victims. He will spread his wings out over your entire land, O Immanuel.”
17817	23	8	9	‡You will be broken, O nations; ‡you will be shattered! ‡Pay attention, all you distant lands of the earth!‡Get ready for battle, and you will be shattered!‡Get ready for battle, and you will be shattered!
17818	23	8	10	‡Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted! ‡Issue your orders, but they will not be executed! ‡For God is with us!
17819	23	8	11	¶Indeed this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me quite forcefully. He warned me not to act like these people:
17820	23	8	12	‡“Do not say, ‘Conspiracy,’ every time these people say the word. ‡Don’t be afraid of what scares them; don’t be terrified.
17821	23	8	13	‡You must recognize the authority of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. ‡He is the one you must respect; ‡he is the one you must fear.
17822	23	8	14	‡He will become a sanctuary, ‡but a stone that makes a person trip, ‡and a rock that makes one stumble – ‡to the two houses of Israel. ‡He will become a trap and a snare‡to the residents of Jerusalem.
17823	23	8	15	‡Many will stumble over the stone and the rock, ‡and will fall and be seriously injured,‡and will be ensnared and captured.”
17824	23	8	16	‡Tie up the scroll as legal evidence, ‡seal the official record of God’s instructions and give it to my followers.
17825	23	8	17	‡I will wait patiently for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡who has rejected the family of Jacob; ‡I will wait for him.
17826	23	8	18	‡Look, I and the sons whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given me are reminders and object lessons in Israel, sent from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, who lives on Mount Zion.
17827	23	8	19	¶They will say to you, “Seek oracles at the pits used to conjure up underworld spirits, from the magicians who chirp and mutter incantations. Should people not seek oracles from their gods, by asking the dead about the destiny of the living?”
17828	23	8	20	Then you must recall the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s instructions and the prophetic testimony of what would happen. Certainly they say such things because their minds are spiritually darkened.
17829	23	8	21	They will pass through the land destitute and starving. Their hunger will make them angry, and they will curse their king and their God as they look upward.
17830	23	8	22	When one looks out over the land, he sees distress and darkness, gloom and anxiety, darkness and people forced from the land.
17831	23	9	1	(8:23) The gloom will be dispelled for those who were anxious. ‡In earlier times he humiliated‡the land of Zebulun,‡and the land of Naphtali; ‡but now he brings honor ‡to the way of the sea,‡the region beyond the Jordan,‡and Galilee of the nations.
17832	23	9	2	‡(9:1) The people walking in darkness‡see a bright light; ‡light shines ‡on those who live in a land of deep darkness.
17833	23	9	3	‡You have enlarged the nation;‡you give them great joy. ‡They rejoice in your presence‡as harvesters rejoice;‡as warriors celebrate when they divide up the plunder.
17834	23	9	4	‡For their oppressive yoke‡and the club that strikes their shoulders,‡the cudgel the oppressor uses on them, ‡you have shattered, as in the day of Midian’s defeat.
17835	23	9	5	‡Indeed every boot that marches and shakes the earth ‡and every garment dragged through blood‡is used as fuel for the fire.
17836	23	9	6	‡For a child has been born to us,‡a son has been given to us.‡He shoulders responsibility ‡and is called: ‡Amazing Adviser, ‡Mighty God, ‡Everlasting Father, ‡Prince of Peace.
17837	23	9	7	‡His dominion will be vast ‡and he will bring immeasurable prosperity. ‡He will rule on David’s throne‡and over David’s kingdom, ‡establishing it and strengthening it‡by promoting justice and fairness, ‡from this time forward and forevermore.‡The zeal of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will accomplish this.
17838	23	9	8	‡The Lord decreed judgment on Jacob,‡and it fell on Israel.
17839	23	9	9	‡All the people were aware of it,‡the people of Ephraim and those living in Samaria. ‡Yet with pride and an arrogant attitude, they said,
17840	23	9	10	‡“The bricks have fallen, ‡but we will rebuild with chiseled stone;‡the sycamore fig trees have been cut down,‡but we will replace them with cedars.”
17841	23	9	11	‡Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> provoked their adversaries to attack them, ‡he stirred up their enemies –
17842	23	9	12	‡Syria from the east,‡and the Philistines from the west,‡they gobbled up Israelite territory. ‡Despite all this, his anger does not subside,‡and his hand is ready to strike again.
17843	23	9	13	‡The people did not return to the one who struck them,‡they did not seek reconciliation with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
17844	23	9	14	‡So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> cut off Israel’s head and tail,‡both the shoots and stalk in one day.
17845	23	9	15	‡The leaders and the highly respected people are the head,‡the prophets who teach lies are the tail.
17846	23	9	16	‡The leaders of this nation were misleading people,‡and the people being led were destroyed.
17847	23	9	17	‡So the Lord was not pleased with their young men,‡he took no pity on their orphans and widows;‡for the whole nation was godless and did wicked things, ‡every mouth was speaking disgraceful words. ‡Despite all this, his anger does not subside,‡and his hand is ready to strike again.
17848	23	9	18	‡For evil burned like a fire, ‡it consumed thorns and briers;‡it burned up the thickets of the forest,‡and they went up in smoke.
17849	23	9	19	‡Because of the anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the land was scorched, ‡and the people became fuel for the fire. ‡People had no compassion on one another.
17850	23	9	20	‡They devoured on the right, but were still hungry,‡they ate on the left, but were not satisfied.‡People even ate the flesh of their own arm!
17851	23	9	21	‡Manasseh fought against Ephraim,‡and Ephraim against Manasseh;‡together they fought against Judah. ‡Despite all this, his anger does not subside,‡and his hand is ready to strike again.
17852	23	10	1	‡Beware, those who enact unjust policies, ‡those who are always instituting unfair regulations,
17853	23	10	2	‡to keep the poor from getting fair treatment,‡and to deprive the oppressed among my people of justice,‡so they can steal what widows own,‡and loot what belongs to orphans.
17854	23	10	3	‡What will you do on judgment day, ‡when destruction arrives from a distant place?‡To whom will you run for help?‡Where will you leave your wealth?
17855	23	10	4	‡You will have no place to go, except to kneel with the prisoners,‡or to fall among those who have been killed. ‡Despite all this, his anger does not subside,‡and his hand is ready to strike again.
17856	23	10	5	‡Beware, Assyria, the club I use to vent my anger, ‡a cudgel with which I angrily punish.
17857	23	10	6	‡I sent him against a godless nation,‡I ordered him to attack the people with whom I was angry, ‡to take plunder and to carry away loot,‡to trample them down like dirt in the streets.
17858	23	10	7	‡But he does not agree with this,‡his mind does not reason this way, ‡for his goal is to destroy,‡and to eliminate many nations.
17859	23	10	8	‡Indeed, he says:‡“Are not my officials all kings?
17860	23	10	9	‡Is not Calneh like Carchemish?‡Hamath like Arpad?‡Samaria like Damascus?
17861	23	10	10	‡I overpowered kingdoms ruled by idols, ‡whose carved images were more impressive than Jerusalem’s or Samaria’s.
17862	23	10	11	‡As I have done to Samaria and its idols,‡so I will do to Jerusalem and its idols.”
17863	23	10	12	¶But when the Lord finishes judging Mount Zion and Jerusalem, then I will punish the king of Assyria for what he has proudly planned and for the arrogant attitude he displays.
17864	23	10	13	For he says:‡“By my strong hand I have accomplished this,‡by my strategy that I devised.‡I invaded the territory of nations, ‡and looted their storehouses.‡Like a mighty conqueror, I brought down rulers.
17865	23	10	14	‡My hand discovered the wealth of the nations, as if it were in a nest,‡as one gathers up abandoned eggs,‡I gathered up the whole earth.‡There was no wing flapping,‡or open mouth chirping.”
17866	23	10	15	‡Does an ax exalt itself over the one who wields it,‡or a saw magnify itself over the one who cuts with it? ‡As if a scepter should brandish the one who raises it,‡or a staff should lift up what is not made of wood!
17867	23	10	16	‡For this reason the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, will make his healthy ones emaciated. His majestic glory will go up in smoke.
17868	23	10	17	‡The Light of Israel will become a fire,‡their Holy One will become a flame;‡it will burn and consume the Assyrian king’s briers‡and his thorns in one day.
17869	23	10	18	‡The splendor of his forest and his orchard‡will be completely destroyed, ‡as when a sick man’s life ebbs away.
17870	23	10	19	‡There will be so few trees left in his forest,‡a child will be able to count them.
17871	23	10	20	¶At that time those left in Israel, those who remain of the family of Jacob, will no longer rely on a foreign leader that abuses them. Instead they will truly rely on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the Holy One of Israel.
17872	23	10	21	A remnant will come back, a remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
17873	23	10	22	For though your people, Israel, are as numerous as the sand on the seashore, only a remnant will come back. Destruction has been decreed; just punishment is about to engulf you.
17874	23	10	23	The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, is certainly ready to carry out the decreed destruction throughout the land.
17875	23	10	24	¶So here is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, says: “My people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of Assyria, even though they beat you with a club and lift their cudgel against you as Egypt did.
17876	23	10	25	For very soon my fury will subside, and my anger will be directed toward their destruction.”
17877	23	10	26	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies is about to beat them with a whip, similar to the way he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will use his staff against the sea, lifting it up as he did in Egypt.
17878	23	10	27	‡At that time ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will remove their burden from your shoulders, ‡and their yoke from your neck;‡the yoke will be taken off because your neck will be too large.
17879	23	10	28	‡They attacked Aiath,‡moved through Migron,‡depositing their supplies at Micmash.
17880	23	10	29	‡They went through the pass,‡spent the night at Geba.‡Ramah trembled,‡Gibeah of Saul ran away.
17881	23	10	30	‡Shout out, daughter of Gallim!‡Pay attention, Laishah!‡Answer her, Anathoth!
17882	23	10	31	‡Madmenah flees,‡the residents of Gebim have hidden.
17883	23	10	32	‡This very day, standing in Nob,‡they shake their fist at Daughter Zion’s mountain – ‡at the hill of Jerusalem.
17884	23	10	33	‡Look, the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,‡is ready to cut off the branches with terrifying power. ‡The tallest trees will be cut down,‡the loftiest ones will be brought low.
17885	23	10	34	‡The thickets of the forest will be chopped down with an ax,‡and mighty Lebanon will fall.
17886	23	11	1	‡A shoot will grow out of Jesse’s root stock,‡a bud will sprout from his roots.
17887	23	11	2	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit will rest on him – ‡a Spirit that gives extraordinary wisdom, ‡a Spirit that provides the ability to execute plans, ‡a Spirit that produces absolute loyalty to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
17888	23	11	3	‡He will take delight in obeying the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‡He will not judge by mere appearances, ‡or make decisions on the basis of hearsay.
17889	23	11	4	‡He will treat the poor fairly, ‡and make right decisions for the downtrodden of the earth. ‡He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, ‡and order the wicked to be executed.
17890	23	11	5	‡Justice will be like a belt around his waist,‡integrity will be like a belt around his hips.
17891	23	11	6	‡A wolf will reside with a lamb,‡and a leopard will lie down with a young goat;‡an ox and a young lion will graze together, ‡as a small child leads them along.
17892	23	11	7	‡A cow and a bear will graze together,‡their young will lie down together. ‡A lion, like an ox, will eat straw.
17893	23	11	8	‡A baby will play ‡over the hole of a snake; ‡over the nest of a serpent‡an infant will put his hand.
17894	23	11	9	‡They will no longer injure or destroy‡on my entire royal mountain. ‡For there will be universal submission to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sovereignty,‡just as the waters completely cover the sea.
17895	23	11	10	¶At that time a root from Jesse will stand like a signal flag for the nations. Nations will look to him for guidance, and his residence will be majestic.
17896	23	11	11	At that time the Lord will again lift his hand to reclaim the remnant of his people from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the seacoasts.
17897	23	11	12	‡He will lift a signal flag for the nations;‡he will gather Israel’s dispersed people ‡and assemble Judah’s scattered people‡from the four corners of the earth.
17898	23	11	13	‡Ephraim’s jealousy will end, ‡and Judah’s hostility will be eliminated.‡Ephraim will no longer be jealous of Judah,‡and Judah will no longer be hostile toward Ephraim.
17899	23	11	14	‡They will swoop down on the Philistine hills to the west; ‡together they will loot the people of the east.‡They will take over Edom and Moab, ‡and the Ammonites will be their subjects.
17900	23	11	15	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will divide the gulf of the Egyptian Sea; ‡he will wave his hand over the Euphrates River and send a strong wind, ‡he will turn it into seven dried-up streams, ‡and enable them to walk across in their sandals.
17901	23	11	16	‡There will be a highway leading out of Assyria‡for the remnant of his people, ‡just as there was for Israel,‡when they went up from the land of Egypt.
17902	23	12	1	‡At that time you will say:‡“I praise you, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡for even though you were angry with me,‡your anger subsided, and you consoled me.
17903	23	12	2	‡Look, God is my deliverer! ‡I will trust in him and not fear.‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gives me strength and protects me; ‡he has become my deliverer.”
17904	23	12	3	‡Joyfully you will draw water‡from the springs of deliverance.
17905	23	12	4	‡At that time you will say:‡“Praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! ‡Ask him for help! ‡Publicize his mighty acts among the nations!‡Make it known that he is unique!
17906	23	12	5	‡Sing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> for he has done magnificent things,‡let this be known throughout the earth!
17907	23	12	6	‡Cry out and shout for joy, O citizens of Zion,‡for the Holy One of Israel acts mightily among you!”
17908	23	13	1	‡This is an oracle about Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:
17909	23	13	2	‡On a bare hill raise a signal flag,‡shout to them,‡wave your hand,‡so they might enter the gates of the princes!
17910	23	13	3	‡I have given orders to my chosen soldiers; ‡I have summoned the warriors through whom I will vent my anger, ‡my boasting, arrogant ones.
17911	23	13	4	‡There is a loud noise on the mountains – ‡it sounds like a large army! ‡There is great commotion among the kingdoms – ‡nations are being assembled!‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies is mustering‡forces for battle.
17912	23	13	5	‡They come from a distant land,‡from the horizon. ‡It is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with his instruments of judgment, ‡coming to destroy the whole earth.
17913	23	13	6	‡Wail, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s day of judgment is near;‡it comes with all the destructive power of the Sovereign One.
17914	23	13	7	‡For this reason all hands hang limp, ‡every human heart loses its courage.
17915	23	13	8	‡They panic – ‡cramps and pain seize hold of them‡like those of a woman who is straining to give birth.‡They look at one another in astonishment;‡their faces are flushed red.
17916	23	13	9	‡Look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s day of judgment is coming;‡it is a day of cruelty and savage, raging anger, ‡destroying the earth ‡and annihilating its sinners.
17917	23	13	10	‡Indeed the stars in the sky and their constellations‡no longer give out their light; ‡the sun is darkened as soon as it rises,‡and the moon does not shine.
17918	23	13	11	‡I will punish the world for its evil, ‡and wicked people for their sin.‡I will put an end to the pride of the insolent,‡I will bring down the arrogance of tyrants.
17919	23	13	12	‡I will make human beings more scarce than pure gold,‡and people more scarce than gold from Ophir.
17920	23	13	13	‡So I will shake the heavens, ‡and the earth will shake loose from its foundation, ‡because of the fury of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,‡in the day he vents his raging anger.
17921	23	13	14	‡Like a frightened gazelle ‡or a sheep with no shepherd,‡each will turn toward home, ‡each will run to his homeland.
17922	23	13	15	‡Everyone who is caught will be stabbed;‡everyone who is seized will die by the sword.
17923	23	13	16	‡Their children will be smashed to pieces before their very eyes;‡their houses will be looted‡and their wives raped.
17924	23	13	17	‡Look, I am stirring up the Medes to attack them; ‡they are not concerned about silver,‡nor are they interested in gold.
17925	23	13	18	‡Their arrows will cut young men to ribbons; ‡they have no compassion on a person’s offspring, ‡they will not look with pity on children.
17926	23	13	19	‡Babylon, the most admired of kingdoms,‡the Chaldeans’ source of honor and pride, ‡will be destroyed by God‡just as Sodom and Gomorrah were.
17927	23	13	20	‡No one will live there again;‡no one will ever reside there again. ‡No bedouin will camp there,‡no shepherds will rest their flocks there.
17928	23	13	21	‡Wild animals will rest there,‡the ruined houses will be full of hyenas. ‡Ostriches will live there,‡wild goats will skip among the ruins.
17929	23	13	22	‡Wild dogs will yip in her ruined fortresses,‡jackals will yelp in the once-splendid palaces. ‡Her time is almost up, ‡her days will not be prolonged.
17930	23	14	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will certainly have compassion on Jacob; he will again choose Israel as his special people and restore them to their land. Resident foreigners will join them and unite with the family of Jacob.
17931	23	14	2	Nations will take them and bring them back to their own place. Then the family of Israel will make foreigners their servants as they settle in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s land. They will make their captors captives and rule over the ones who oppressed them.
17932	23	14	3	When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gives you relief from your suffering and anxiety, and from the hard labor which you were made to perform,
17933	23	14	4	you will taunt the king of Babylon with these words: ‡“Look how the oppressor has met his end!‡Hostility has ceased!
17934	23	14	5	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has broken the club of the wicked,‡the scepter of rulers.
17935	23	14	6	‡It furiously struck down nations‡with unceasing blows. ‡It angrily ruled over nations,‡oppressing them without restraint.
17936	23	14	7	‡The whole earth rests and is quiet;‡they break into song.
17937	23	14	8	‡The evergreens also rejoice over your demise, ‡as do the cedars of Lebanon, singing, ‡‘Since you fell asleep, ‡no woodsman comes up to chop us down!’
17938	23	14	9	‡Sheol below is stirred up about you,‡ready to meet you when you arrive.‡It rouses the spirits of the dead for you,‡all the former leaders of the earth; ‡it makes all the former kings of the nations‡rise from their thrones.
17939	23	14	10	‡All of them respond to you, saying:‡‘You too have become weak like us!‡You have become just like us!
17940	23	14	11	‡Your splendor has been brought down to Sheol,‡as well as the sound of your stringed instruments. ‡You lie on a bed of maggots,‡with a blanket of worms over you.
17941	23	14	12	‡Look how you have fallen from the sky,‡O shining one, son of the dawn! ‡You have been cut down to the ground,‡O conqueror of the nations!
17942	23	14	13	‡You said to yourself, ‡“I will climb up to the sky.‡Above the stars of El ‡I will set up my throne.‡I will rule on the mountain of assembly‡on the remote slopes of Zaphon.
17943	23	14	14	‡I will climb up to the tops of the clouds;‡I will make myself like the Most High!”
17944	23	14	15	‡But you were brought down to Sheol,‡to the remote slopes of the Pit.
17945	23	14	16	‡Those who see you stare at you,‡they look at you carefully, thinking: ‡“Is this the man who shook the earth,‡the one who made kingdoms tremble?
17946	23	14	17	‡Is this the one who made the world like a wilderness,‡who ruined its cities,‡and refused to free his prisoners so they could return home?”’
17947	23	14	18	‡As for all the kings of the nations,‡all of them lie down in splendor, ‡each in his own tomb.
17948	23	14	19	‡But you have been thrown out of your grave‡like a shoot that is thrown away. ‡You lie among the slain,‡among those who have been slashed by the sword,‡among those headed for the stones of the Pit, ‡as if you were a mangled corpse.
17949	23	14	20	‡You will not be buried with them, ‡because you destroyed your land‡and killed your people.‡The offspring of the wicked‡will never be mentioned again.
17950	23	14	21	‡Prepare to execute his sons‡for the sins their ancestors have committed. ‡They must not rise up and take possession of the earth,‡or fill the surface of the world with cities.”
17951	23	14	22	‡“I will rise up against them,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.‡“I will blot out all remembrance of Babylon and destroy all her people, ‡including the offspring she produces,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
17952	23	14	23	‡“I will turn her into a place that is overrun with wild animals ‡and covered with pools of stagnant water.‡I will get rid of her, just as one sweeps away dirt with a broom,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
17953	23	14	24	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies makes this solemn vow:‡“Be sure of this:‡Just as I have intended, so it will be;‡just as I have planned, it will happen.
17954	23	14	25	‡I will break Assyria in my land,‡I will trample them underfoot on my hills.‡Their yoke will be removed from my people,‡the burden will be lifted from their shoulders.
17955	23	14	26	‡This is the plan I have devised for the whole earth;‡my hand is ready to strike all the nations.”
17956	23	14	27	‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has a plan,‡and who can possibly frustrate it?‡His hand is ready to strike,‡and who can possibly stop it?
17957	23	14	28	¶This oracle came in the year that King Ahaz died:
17958	23	14	29	‡Don’t be so happy, all you Philistines,‡just because the club that beat you has been broken! ‡For a viper will grow out of the serpent’s root,‡and its fruit will be a darting adder.
17959	23	14	30	‡The poor will graze in my pastures; ‡the needy will rest securely.‡But I will kill your root by famine;‡it will put to death all your survivors.
17960	23	14	31	‡Wail, O city gate!‡Cry out, O city!‡Melt with fear, all you Philistines!‡For out of the north comes a cloud of smoke,‡and there are no stragglers in its ranks.
17961	23	14	32	‡How will they respond to the messengers of this nation? ‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has made Zion secure;‡the oppressed among his people will find safety in her.
17962	23	15	1	‡This is an oracle about Moab:‡Indeed, in a night it is devastated,‡Ar of Moab is destroyed!‡Indeed, in a night it is devastated,‡Kir of Moab is destroyed!
17963	23	15	2	‡They went up to the temple, ‡the people of Dibon went up to the high places to lament. ‡Because of what happened to Nebo and Medeba, Moab wails.‡Every head is shaved bare,‡every beard is trimmed off.
17964	23	15	3	‡In their streets they wear sackcloth;‡on their roofs and in their town squares‡all of them wail,‡they fall down weeping.
17965	23	15	4	‡The people of Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,‡their voices are heard as far away as Jahaz.‡For this reason Moab’s soldiers shout in distress;‡their courage wavers.
17966	23	15	5	‡My heart cries out because of Moab’s plight, ‡and for the fugitives stretched out as far as Zoar and Eglath Shelishiyah.‡For they weep as they make their way up the ascent of Luhith;‡they loudly lament their demise on the road to Horonaim.
17967	23	15	6	‡For the waters of Nimrim are gone; ‡the grass is dried up,‡the vegetation has disappeared,‡and there are no plants.
17968	23	15	7	‡For this reason what they have made and stored up,‡they carry over the Stream of the Poplars.
17969	23	15	8	‡Indeed, the cries of distress echo throughout Moabite territory;‡their wailing can be heard in Eglaim and Beer Elim.
17970	23	15	9	‡Indeed, the waters of Dimon are full of blood!‡Indeed, I will heap even more trouble on Dimon. ‡A lion will attack the Moabite fugitives‡and the people left in the land.
17971	23	16	1	‡Send rams as tribute to the ruler of the land, ‡from Sela in the wilderness ‡to the hill of Daughter Zion.
17972	23	16	2	‡At the fords of the Arnon ‡the Moabite women are like a bird‡that flies about when forced from its nest.
17973	23	16	3	‡“Bring a plan, make a decision! ‡Provide some shade in the middle of the day! ‡Hide the fugitives! Do not betray the one who tries to escape!
17974	23	16	4	‡Please let the Moabite fugitives live among you.‡Hide them from the destroyer!”‡Certainly the one who applies pressure will cease, ‡the destroyer will come to an end,‡those who trample will disappear from the earth.
17975	23	16	5	‡Then a trustworthy king will be established;‡he will rule in a reliable manner,‡this one from David’s family. ‡He will be sure to make just decisions‡and will be experienced in executing justice.
17976	23	16	6	‡We have heard about Moab’s pride,‡their great arrogance,‡their boasting, pride, and excess. ‡But their boastful claims are empty!
17977	23	16	7	‡So Moab wails over its demise – ‡they all wail!‡Completely devastated, they moan‡about what has happened to the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.
17978	23	16	8	‡For the fields of Heshbon are dried up,‡as well as the vines of Sibmah.‡The rulers of the nations trample all over its vines,‡which reach Jazer and spread to the wilderness;‡their shoots spread out and cross the sea.
17979	23	16	9	‡So I weep along with Jazer ‡over the vines of Sibmah.‡I will saturate you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh,‡for the conquering invaders shout triumphantly‡over your fruit and crops.
17980	23	16	10	‡Joy and happiness disappear from the orchards,‡and in the vineyards no one rejoices or shouts;‡no one treads out juice in the wine vats – ‡I have brought the joyful shouts to an end.
17981	23	16	11	‡So my heart constantly sighs for Moab, like the strumming of a harp, ‡my inner being sighs for Kir Hareseth.
17982	23	16	12	‡When the Moabites plead with all their might at their high places, ‡and enter their temples to pray, their prayers will be ineffective!
17983	23	16	13	¶This is the message the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> previously announced about Moab.
17984	23	16	14	Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> makes this announcement: “Within exactly three years Moab’s splendor will disappear, along with all her many people; there will be just a few, insignificant survivors left.”
17985	23	17	1	‡This is an oracle about Damascus:‡“Look, Damascus is no longer a city,‡it is a heap of ruins!
17986	23	17	2	‡The cities of Aroer are abandoned. ‡They will be used for herds,‡which will lie down there in peace.
17987	23	17	3	‡Fortified cities will disappear from Ephraim,‡and Damascus will lose its kingdom. ‡The survivors in Syria‡will end up like the splendor of the Israelites,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
17988	23	17	4	‡“At that time ‡Jacob’s splendor will be greatly diminished, ‡and he will become skin and bones.
17989	23	17	5	‡It will be as when one gathers the grain harvest, ‡and his hand gleans the ear of grain.‡It will be like one gathering the ears of grain‡in the Valley of Rephaim.
17990	23	17	6	‡There will be some left behind,‡like when an olive tree is beaten – ‡two or three ripe olives remain toward the very top,‡four or five on its fruitful branches,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
17991	23	17	7	‡At that time men will trust in their Creator; ‡they will depend on the Holy One of Israel.
17992	23	17	8	‡They will no longer trust in the altars their hands made,‡or depend on the Asherah poles and incense altars their fingers made.
17993	23	17	9	‡At that time their fortified cities will be ‡like the abandoned summits of the Amorites, ‡which they abandoned because of the Israelites;‡there will be desolation.
17994	23	17	10	‡For you ignore the God who rescues you;‡you pay no attention to your strong protector. ‡So this is what happens:‡You cultivate beautiful plants‡and plant exotic vines.
17995	23	17	11	‡The day you begin cultivating, you do what you can to make it grow; ‡the morning you begin planting, you do what you can to make it sprout.‡Yet the harvest will disappear in the day of disease‡and incurable pain.
17996	23	17	12	‡Beware, you many nations massing together, ‡those who make a commotion as loud as the roaring of the sea’s waves. ‡Beware, you people making such an uproar, ‡those who make an uproar as loud as the roaring of powerful waves.
17997	23	17	13	‡Though these people make an uproar as loud as the roaring of powerful waves, ‡when he shouts at them, they will flee to a distant land,‡driven before the wind like dead weeds on the hills,‡or like dead thistles before a strong gale.
17998	23	17	14	‡In the evening there is sudden terror; ‡by morning they vanish. ‡This is the fate of those who try to plunder us,‡the destiny of those who try to loot us!
17999	23	18	1	‡Beware, land of buzzing wings, ‡the one beyond the rivers of Cush,
18000	23	18	2	‡that sends messengers by sea,‡who glide over the water’s surface in boats made of papyrus.‡Go, you swift messengers,‡to a nation of tall, smooth-skinned people, ‡to a people that are feared far and wide, ‡to a nation strong and victorious, ‡whose land rivers divide.
18001	23	18	3	‡All you who live in the world,‡who reside on the earth,‡you will see a signal flag raised on the mountains;‡you will hear a trumpet being blown.
18002	23	18	4	‡For this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has told me:‡“I will wait and watch from my place,‡like scorching heat produced by the sunlight, ‡like a cloud of mist in the heat of harvest.”
18003	23	18	5	‡For before the harvest, when the bud has sprouted,‡and the ripening fruit appears, ‡he will cut off the unproductive shoots with pruning knives;‡he will prune the tendrils.
18004	23	18	6	‡They will all be left for the birds of the hills‡and the wild animals; ‡the birds will eat them during the summer,‡and all the wild animals will eat them during the winter.
18005	23	18	7	‡At that time‡tribute will be brought to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,‡by a people that are tall and smooth-skinned,‡a people that are feared far and wide,‡a nation strong and victorious,‡whose land rivers divide. ‡The tribute will be brought to the place where the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has chosen to reside, on Mount Zion.
18006	23	19	1	‡This is an oracle about Egypt:‡Look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rides on a swift-moving cloud‡and approaches Egypt.‡The idols of Egypt tremble before him;‡the Egyptians lose their courage.
18007	23	19	2	‡“I will provoke civil strife in Egypt, ‡brothers will fight with each other,‡as will neighbors,‡cities, and kingdoms.
18008	23	19	3	‡The Egyptians will panic, ‡and I will confuse their strategy. ‡They will seek guidance from the idols and from the spirits of the dead,‡from the pits used to conjure up underworld spirits, and from the magicians.
18009	23	19	4	‡I will hand Egypt over to a harsh master;‡a powerful king will rule over them,”‡says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
18010	23	19	5	‡The water of the sea will be dried up,‡and the river will dry up and be empty.
18011	23	19	6	‡The canals will stink; ‡the streams of Egypt will trickle and then dry up;‡the bulrushes and reeds will decay,
18012	23	19	7	‡along with the plants by the mouth of the river. ‡All the cultivated land near the river‡will turn to dust and be blown away.
18013	23	19	8	‡The fishermen will mourn and lament,‡all those who cast a fishhook into the river,‡and those who spread out a net on the water’s surface will grieve.
18014	23	19	9	‡Those who make clothes from combed flax will be embarrassed;‡those who weave will turn pale.
18015	23	19	10	‡Those who make cloth will be demoralized; ‡all the hired workers will be depressed.
18016	23	19	11	‡The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools; ‡Pharaoh’s wise advisers give stupid advice.‡How dare you say to Pharaoh,‡“I am one of the sages,‡one well-versed in the writings of the ancient kings?”
18017	23	19	12	‡But where, oh where, are your wise men? ‡Let them tell you, let them find out‡what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has planned for Egypt.
18018	23	19	13	‡The officials of Zoan are fools,‡the officials of Memphis are misled;‡the rulers of her tribes lead Egypt astray.
18019	23	19	14	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has made them undiscerning; ‡they lead Egypt astray in all she does,‡so that she is like a drunk sliding around in his own vomit.
18020	23	19	15	‡Egypt will not be able to do a thing,‡head or tail, shoots or stalk.
18021	23	19	16	¶At that time the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies brandishes his fist against them.
18022	23	19	17	The land of Judah will humiliate Egypt. Everyone who hears about Judah will be afraid because of what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies is planning to do to them.
18023	23	19	18	¶At that time five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. One will be called the City of the Sun.
18024	23	19	19	At that time there will be an altar for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the middle of the land of Egypt, as well as a sacred pillar dedicated to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at its border.
18025	23	19	20	It will become a visual reminder in the land of Egypt of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. When they cry out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> because of oppressors, he will send them a deliverer and defender who will rescue them.
18026	23	19	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will reveal himself to the Egyptians, and they will acknowledge the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s authority at that time. They will present sacrifices and offerings; they will make vows to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and fulfill them.
18027	23	19	22	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will strike Egypt, striking and then healing them. They will turn to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and he will listen to their prayers and heal them.
18028	23	19	23	¶At that time there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will visit Egypt, and the Egyptians will visit Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.
18029	23	19	24	At that time Israel will be the third member of the group, along with Egypt and Assyria, and will be a recipient of blessing in the earth.
18030	23	19	25	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will pronounce a blessing over the earth, saying, “Blessed be my people, Egypt, and the work of my hands, Assyria, and my special possession, Israel!”
18031	23	20	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> revealed the following message during the year in which King Sargon of Assyria sent his commanding general to Ashdod, and he fought against it and captured it.
18032	23	20	2	At that time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> announced through Isaiah son of Amoz: “Go, remove the sackcloth from your waist and take your sandals off your feet.” He did as instructed and walked around in undergarments and barefoot.
18033	23	20	3	Later the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> explained, “In the same way that my servant Isaiah has walked around in undergarments and barefoot for the past three years, as an object lesson and omen pertaining to Egypt and Cush,
18034	23	20	4	so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, both young and old. They will be in undergarments and barefoot, with the buttocks exposed; the Egyptians will be publicly humiliated.
18035	23	20	5	Those who put their hope in Cush and took pride in Egypt will be afraid and embarrassed.
18036	23	20	6	At that time those who live on this coast will say, ‘Look what has happened to our source of hope to whom we fled for help, expecting to be rescued from the king of Assyria! How can we escape now?’”
18037	23	21	1	‡This is an oracle about the wilderness by the Sea: ‡Like strong winds blowing in the south, ‡one invades from the wilderness,‡from a land that is feared.
18038	23	21	2	‡I have received a distressing message: ‡“The deceiver deceives,‡the destroyer destroys.‡Attack, you Elamites!‡Lay siege, you Medes!‡I will put an end to all the groaning!”
18039	23	21	3	‡For this reason my stomach churns; ‡cramps overwhelm me‡like the contractions of a woman in labor.‡I am disturbed by what I hear,‡horrified by what I see.
18040	23	21	4	‡My heart palpitates, ‡I shake in fear; ‡the twilight I desired‡has brought me terror.
18041	23	21	5	‡Arrange the table,‡lay out the carpet,‡eat and drink! ‡Get up, you officers,‡smear oil on the shields!
18042	23	21	6	‡For this is what the Lord has told me:‡“Go, post a guard!‡He must report what he sees.
18043	23	21	7	‡When he sees chariots, ‡teams of horses, ‡riders on donkeys,‡riders on camels,‡he must be alert,‡very alert.”
18044	23	21	8	‡Then the guard cries out:‡“On the watchtower, O Lord, ‡I stand all day long;‡at my post‡I am stationed every night.
18045	23	21	9	‡Look what’s coming!‡A charioteer,‡a team of horses.” ‡When questioned, he replies, ‡“Babylon has fallen, fallen!‡All the idols of her gods lie shattered on the ground!”
18046	23	21	10	‡O my downtrodden people, crushed like stalks on the threshing floor, ‡what I have heard ‡from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,‡the God of Israel,‡I have reported to you.
18047	23	21	11	‡This is an oracle about Dumah: ‡Someone calls to me from Seir, ‡“Watchman, what is left of the night?‡Watchman, what is left of the night?”
18048	23	21	12	‡The watchman replies,‡“Morning is coming, but then night. ‡If you want to ask, ask;‡come back again.”
18049	23	21	13	‡This is an oracle about Arabia:‡In the thicket of Arabia you spend the night,‡you Dedanite caravans.
18050	23	21	14	‡Bring out some water for the thirsty.‡You who live in the land of Tema,‡bring some food for the fugitives.
18051	23	21	15	‡For they flee from the swords – ‡from the drawn sword‡and from the battle-ready bow‡and from the severity of the battle.
18052	23	21	16	¶For this is what the Lord has told me: “Within exactly one year all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end.
18053	23	21	17	Just a handful of archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be left.” Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has spoken.
18054	23	22	1	‡This is an oracle about the Valley of Vision: ‡What is the reason ‡that all of you go up to the rooftops?
18055	23	22	2	‡The noisy city is full of raucous sounds;‡the town is filled with revelry. ‡Your slain were not cut down by the sword;‡they did not die in battle.
18056	23	22	3	‡All your leaders ran away together – ‡they fled to a distant place;‡all your refugees were captured together – ‡they were captured without a single arrow being shot.
18057	23	22	4	‡So I say:‡“Don’t look at me! ‡I am weeping bitterly.‡Don’t try to console me‡concerning the destruction of my defenseless people.”
18058	23	22	5	‡For the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,‡has planned a day of panic, defeat, and confusion. ‡In the Valley of Vision people shout ‡and cry out to the hill.
18059	23	22	6	‡The Elamites picked up the quiver,‡and came with chariots and horsemen; ‡the men of Kir prepared the shield.
18060	23	22	7	‡Your very best valleys were full of chariots; ‡horsemen confidently took their positions at the gate.
18061	23	22	8	‡They removed the defenses of Judah.‡At that time you looked‡for the weapons in the House of the Forest.
18062	23	22	9	‡You saw the many breaks‡in the walls of the City of David; ‡you stored up water in the lower pool.
18063	23	22	10	‡You counted the houses in Jerusalem, ‡and demolished houses so you could have material to reinforce the wall.
18064	23	22	11	‡You made a reservoir between the two walls‡for the water of the old pool – ‡but you did not trust in the one who made it; ‡you did not depend on the one who formed it long ago!
18065	23	22	12	‡At that time the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, called for weeping and mourning,‡for shaved heads and sackcloth.
18066	23	22	13	‡But look, there is outright celebration! ‡You say, “Kill the ox and slaughter the sheep,‡eat meat and drink wine.‡Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”
18067	23	22	14	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies told me this: “Certainly this sin will not be forgiven as long as you live,” says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
18068	23	22	15	‡This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, says:‡“Go visit this administrator, Shebna, who supervises the palace, and tell him:
18069	23	22	16	‡‘What right do you have to be here? What relatives do you have buried here? ‡Why do you chisel out a tomb for yourself here?‡He chisels out his burial site in an elevated place,‡he carves out his tomb on a cliff.
18070	23	22	17	‡Look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will throw you far away, you mere man! ‡He will wrap you up tightly.
18071	23	22	18	‡He will wind you up tightly into a ball‡and throw you into a wide, open land. ‡There you will die,‡and there with you will be your impressive chariots, ‡which bring disgrace to the house of your master.
18072	23	22	19	‡I will remove you from your office;‡you will be thrown down from your position.
18073	23	22	20	¶“At that time I will summon my servant Eliakim, son of Hilkiah.
18074	23	22	21	I will put your robe on him, tie your belt around him, and transfer your authority to him. He will become a protector of the residents of Jerusalem and of the people of Judah.
18075	23	22	22	I will place the key to the house of David on his shoulder. When he opens the door, no one can close it; when he closes the door, no one can open it.
18076	23	22	23	I will fasten him like a peg into a solid place; he will bring honor and respect to his father’s family.
18077	23	22	24	His father’s family will gain increasing prominence because of him, including the offspring and the offshoots. All the small containers, including the bowls and all the jars will hang from this peg.’
18078	23	22	25	¶“At that time,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “the peg fastened into a solid place will come loose. It will be cut off and fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut off.” Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken.
18079	23	23	1	‡This is an oracle about Tyre:‡Wail, you large ships, ‡for the port is too devastated to enter! ‡From the land of Cyprus this news is announced to them.
18080	23	23	2	‡Lament, you residents of the coast,‡you merchants of Sidon who travel over the sea,‡whose agents sail over
18081	23	23	3	the deep waters! ‡Grain from the Shihor region, ‡crops grown near the Nile she receives; ‡she is the trade center of the nations.
18082	23	23	4	‡Be ashamed, O Sidon, ‡for the sea says this, O fortress of the sea:‡“I have not gone into labor ‡or given birth;‡I have not raised young men‡or brought up young women.”
18083	23	23	5	‡When the news reaches Egypt,‡they will be shaken by what has happened to Tyre.
18084	23	23	6	‡Travel to Tarshish!‡Wail, you residents of the coast!
18085	23	23	7	‡Is this really your boisterous city ‡whose origins are in the distant past, ‡and whose feet led her to a distant land to reside?
18086	23	23	8	‡Who planned this for royal Tyre, ‡whose merchants are princes,‡whose traders are the dignitaries of the earth?
18087	23	23	9	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies planned it – ‡to dishonor the pride that comes from all her beauty, ‡to humiliate all the dignitaries of the earth.
18088	23	23	10	‡Daughter Tarshish, travel back to your land, as one crosses the Nile;‡there is no longer any marketplace in Tyre.
18089	23	23	11	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> stretched out his hand over the sea, ‡he shook kingdoms;‡he gave the order ‡to destroy Canaan’s fortresses.
18090	23	23	12	‡He said,‡“You will no longer celebrate,‡oppressed virgin daughter Sidon!‡Get up, travel to Cyprus,‡but you will find no relief there.”
18091	23	23	13	‡Look at the land of the Chaldeans,‡these people who have lost their identity! ‡The Assyrians have made it a home for wild animals.‡They erected their siege towers, ‡demolished its fortresses,‡and turned it into a heap of ruins.
18092	23	23	14	‡Wail, you large ships, ‡for your fortress is destroyed!
18093	23	23	15	¶At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the typical life span of a king. At the end of seventy years Tyre will try to attract attention again, like the prostitute in the popular song:
18094	23	23	16	‡“Take the harp,‡go through the city,‡forgotten prostitute!‡Play it well,‡play lots of songs,‡so you’ll be noticed!”
18095	23	23	17	¶At the end of seventy years the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will revive Tyre. She will start making money again by selling her services to all the earth’s kingdoms.
18096	23	23	18	Her profits and earnings will be set apart for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They will not be stored up or accumulated, for her profits will be given to those who live in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence and will be used to purchase large quantities of food and beautiful clothes.
18097	23	24	1	‡Look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is ready to devastate the earth‡and leave it in ruins;‡he will mar its surface‡and scatter its inhabitants.
18098	23	24	2	‡Everyone will suffer – the priest as well as the people, ‡the master as well as the servant, ‡the elegant lady as well as the female attendant, ‡the seller as well as the buyer, ‡the borrower as well as the lender, ‡the creditor as well as the debtor.
18099	23	24	3	‡The earth will be completely devastated‡and thoroughly ransacked.‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has decreed this judgment.
18100	23	24	4	‡The earth dries up and withers,‡the world shrivels up and withers;‡the prominent people of the earth fade away.
18101	23	24	5	‡The earth is defiled by its inhabitants, ‡for they have violated laws,‡disregarded the regulation, ‡and broken the permanent treaty.
18102	23	24	6	‡So a treaty curse devours the earth;‡its inhabitants pay for their guilt. ‡This is why the inhabitants of the earth disappear, ‡and are reduced to just a handful of people.
18103	23	24	7	‡The new wine dries up,‡the vines shrivel up,‡all those who like to celebrate groan.
18104	23	24	8	‡The happy sound of the tambourines stops,‡the revelry of those who celebrate comes to a halt,‡the happy sound of the harp ceases.
18105	23	24	9	‡They no longer sing and drink wine; ‡the beer tastes bitter to those who drink it.
18106	23	24	10	‡The ruined town is shattered;‡all of the houses are shut up tight.
18107	23	24	11	‡They howl in the streets because of what happened to the wine; ‡all joy turns to sorrow; ‡celebrations disappear from the earth.
18108	23	24	12	‡The city is left in ruins; ‡the gate is reduced to rubble.
18109	23	24	13	‡This is what will happen throughout the earth,‡among the nations.‡It will be like when they beat an olive tree,‡and just a few olives are left at the end of the harvest.
18110	23	24	14	‡They lift their voices and shout joyfully;‡they praise the majesty of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the west.
18111	23	24	15	‡So in the east extol the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡along the seacoasts extol the fame of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel.
18112	23	24	16	‡From the ends of the earth we hear songs – ‡the Just One is majestic. ‡But I say, “I’m wasting away! I’m wasting away! I’m doomed!‡Deceivers deceive, deceivers thoroughly deceive!”
18113	23	24	17	‡Terror, pit, and snare‡are ready to overtake you inhabitants of the earth!
18114	23	24	18	‡The one who runs away from the sound of the terror‡will fall into the pit; ‡the one who climbs out of the pit,‡will be trapped by the snare.‡For the floodgates of the heavens are opened up ‡and the foundations of the earth shake.
18115	23	24	19	‡The earth is broken in pieces,‡the earth is ripped to shreds,‡the earth shakes violently.
18116	23	24	20	‡The earth will stagger around like a drunk;‡it will sway back and forth like a hut in a windstorm. ‡Its sin will weigh it down,‡and it will fall and never get up again.
18117	23	24	21	‡At that time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will punish ‡the heavenly forces in the heavens ‡and the earthly kings on the earth.
18118	23	24	22	‡They will be imprisoned in a pit, ‡locked up in a prison,‡and after staying there for a long time, they will be punished.
18119	23	24	23	‡The full moon will be covered up, ‡the bright sun will be darkened; ‡for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will rule ‡on Mount Zion in Jerusalem ‡in the presence of his assembly, in majestic splendor.
18120	23	25	1	‡O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you are my God! ‡I will exalt you in praise, I will extol your fame. ‡For you have done extraordinary things,‡and executed plans made long ago exactly as you decreed.
18121	23	25	2	‡Indeed, you have made the city into a heap of rubble,‡the fortified town into a heap of ruins;‡the fortress of foreigners is no longer a city,‡it will never be rebuilt.
18122	23	25	3	‡So a strong nation will extol you;‡the towns of powerful nations will fear you.
18123	23	25	4	‡For you are a protector for the poor,‡a protector for the needy in their distress,‡a shelter from the rainstorm,‡a shade from the heat.‡Though the breath of tyrants is like a winter rainstorm,
18124	23	25	5	‡like heat in a dry land,‡you humble the boasting foreigners. ‡Just as the shadow of a cloud causes the heat to subside, ‡so he causes the song of tyrants to cease.
18125	23	25	6	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will hold a banquet for all the nations on this mountain. ‡At this banquet there will be plenty of meat and aged wine – ‡tender meat and choicest wine.
18126	23	25	7	‡On this mountain he will swallow up ‡the shroud that is over all the peoples, ‡the woven covering that is over all the nations;
18127	23	25	8	‡he will swallow up death permanently. ‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will wipe away the tears from every face,‡and remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth.‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has announced it!
18128	23	25	9	‡At that time they will say, ‡“Look, here is our God!‡We waited for him and he delivered us.‡Here is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! We waited for him.‡Let’s rejoice and celebrate his deliverance!”
18129	23	25	10	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s power will make this mountain secure. ‡Moab will be trampled down where it stands, ‡as a heap of straw is trampled down in a manure pile.
18130	23	25	11	‡Moab will spread out its hands in the middle of it, ‡just as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will bring down Moab’s pride as it spreads its hands.
18131	23	25	12	‡The fortified city (along with the very tops of your walls) he will knock down,‡he will bring it down, he will throw it down to the dusty ground.
18132	23	26	1	‡At that time this song will be sung in the land of Judah:‡“We have a strong city!‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s deliverance, like walls and a rampart, makes it secure.
18133	23	26	2	‡Open the gates so a righteous nation can enter – ‡one that remains trustworthy.
18134	23	26	3	‡You keep completely safe the people who maintain their faith,‡for they trust in you.
18135	23	26	4	‡Trust in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from this time forward, ‡even in Yah, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, an enduring protector!
18136	23	26	5	‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> knocks down those who live in a high place,‡he brings down an elevated town;‡he brings it down to the ground, ‡he throws it down to the dust.
18137	23	26	6	‡It is trampled underfoot‡by the feet of the oppressed,‡by the soles of the poor.”
18138	23	26	7	‡The way of the righteous is level, ‡the path of the righteous that you make is straight.
18139	23	26	8	‡Yes, as your judgments unfold, ‡O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, we wait for you.‡We desire your fame and reputation to grow.
18140	23	26	9	‡I look for you during the night,‡my spirit within me seeks you at dawn,‡for when your judgments come upon the earth,‡those who live in the world learn about justice.
18141	23	26	10	‡If the wicked are shown mercy,‡they do not learn about justice. ‡Even in a land where right is rewarded, they act unjustly; ‡they do not see the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s majesty revealed.
18142	23	26	11	‡O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you are ready to act, ‡but they don’t even notice.‡They will see and be put to shame by your angry judgment against humankind, ‡yes, fire will consume your enemies.
18143	23	26	12	‡O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you make us secure, ‡for even all we have accomplished, you have done for us.
18144	23	26	13	‡O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, our God,‡masters other than you have ruled us,‡but we praise your name alone.
18145	23	26	14	‡The dead do not come back to life,‡the spirits of the dead do not rise. ‡That is because you came in judgment and destroyed them,‡you wiped out all memory of them.
18146	23	26	15	‡You have made the nation larger, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡you have made the nation larger and revealed your splendor, ‡you have extended all the borders of the land.
18147	23	26	16	‡O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, in distress they looked for you;‡they uttered incantations because of your discipline.
18148	23	26	17	‡As when a pregnant woman gets ready to deliver‡and strains and cries out because of her labor pains,‡so were we because of you, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18149	23	26	18	‡We were pregnant, we strained,‡we gave birth, as it were, to wind. ‡We cannot produce deliverance on the earth;‡people to populate the world are not born.
18150	23	26	19	‡Your dead will come back to life;‡your corpses will rise up.‡Wake up and shout joyfully, you who live in the ground! ‡For you will grow like plants drenched with the morning dew, ‡and the earth will bring forth its dead spirits.
18151	23	26	20	‡Go, my people! Enter your inner rooms!‡Close your doors behind you!‡Hide for a little while,‡until his angry judgment is over!
18152	23	26	21	‡For look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is coming out of the place where he lives, ‡to punish the sin of those who live on the earth.‡The earth will display the blood shed on it;‡it will no longer cover up its slain.
18153	23	27	1	‡At that time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will punish‡with his destructive, great, and powerful sword‡Leviathan the fast-moving serpent,‡Leviathan the squirming serpent;‡he will kill the sea monster.
18154	23	27	2	‡When that time comes, ‡sing about a delightful vineyard!
18155	23	27	3	‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, protect it; ‡I water it regularly. ‡I guard it night and day,‡so no one can harm it.
18156	23	27	4	‡I am not angry.‡I wish I could confront some thorns and briers!‡Then I would march against them for battle;‡I would set them all on fire,
18157	23	27	5	‡unless they became my subjects ‡and made peace with me;‡let them make peace with me.
18158	23	27	6	‡The time is coming when Jacob will take root; ‡Israel will blossom and grow branches.‡The produce will fill the surface of the world.
18159	23	27	7	‡Has the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> struck down Israel like he did their oppressors? ‡Has Israel been killed like their enemies?
18160	23	27	8	‡When you summon her for divorce, you prosecute her; ‡he drives her away with his strong wind in the day of the east wind.
18161	23	27	9	‡So in this way Jacob’s sin will be forgiven, ‡and this is how they will show they are finished sinning: ‡They will make all the stones of the altars ‡like crushed limestone,‡and the Asherah poles and the incense altars will no longer stand.
18162	23	27	10	‡For the fortified city is left alone;‡it is a deserted settlement‡and abandoned like the wilderness.‡Calves graze there;‡they lie down there‡and eat its branches bare.
18163	23	27	11	‡When its branches get brittle, they break;‡women come and use them for kindling. ‡For these people lack understanding, ‡therefore the one who made them has no compassion on them;‡the one who formed them has no mercy on them.
18164	23	27	12	¶At that time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will shake the tree, from the Euphrates River to the Stream of Egypt. Then you will be gathered up one by one, O Israelites.
18165	23	27	13	At that time a large trumpet will be blown, and the ones lost in the land of Assyria will come, as well as the refugees in the land of Egypt. They will worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
18166	23	28	1	‡The splendid crown of Ephraim’s drunkards is doomed, ‡the withering flower, its beautiful splendor, ‡situated at the head of a rich valley,‡the crown of those overcome with wine.
18167	23	28	2	‡Look, the Lord sends a strong, powerful one. ‡With the force of a hailstorm or a destructive windstorm, ‡with the might of a driving, torrential rainstorm, ‡he will knock that crown to the ground with his hand.
18168	23	28	3	‡The splendid crown of Ephraim’s drunkards‡will be trampled underfoot.
18169	23	28	4	‡The withering flower, its beautiful splendor,‡situated at the head of a rich valley, ‡will be like an early fig before harvest – ‡as soon as someone notices it,‡he grabs it and swallows it.
18170	23	28	5	‡At that time the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will become a beautiful crown ‡and a splendid diadem for the remnant of his people.
18171	23	28	6	‡He will give discernment to the one who makes judicial decisions,‡and strength to those who defend the city from attackers.
18172	23	28	7	‡Even these men stagger because of wine,‡they stumble around because of beer – ‡priests and prophets stagger because of beer,‡they are confused because of wine,‡they stumble around because of beer;‡they stagger while seeing prophetic visions, ‡they totter while making legal decisions.
18173	23	28	8	‡Indeed, all the tables‡are covered with vomit,‡with filth, leaving no clean place.
18174	23	28	9	‡Who is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> trying to teach?‡To whom is he explaining a message? ‡Those just weaned from milk!‡Those just taken from their mother’s breast!
18175	23	28	10	‡Indeed, they will hear meaningless gibberish,‡senseless babbling,‡a syllable here, a syllable there.
18176	23	28	11	‡For with mocking lips and a foreign tongue‡he will speak to these people.
18177	23	28	12	‡In the past he said to them, ‡“This is where security can be found.‡Provide security for the one who is exhausted!‡This is where rest can be found.” ‡But they refused to listen.
18178	23	28	13	‡So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message to them will sound like‡meaningless gibberish,‡senseless babbling,‡a syllable here, a syllable there. ‡As a result, they will fall on their backsides when they try to walk, ‡and be injured, ensnared, and captured.
18179	23	28	14	‡Therefore, listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message,‡you who mock,‡you rulers of these people‡who reside in Jerusalem!
18180	23	28	15	‡For you say,‡“We have made a treaty with death,‡with Sheol we have made an agreement. ‡When the overwhelming judgment sweeps by ‡it will not reach us.‡For we have made a lie our refuge,‡we have hidden ourselves in a deceitful word.”
18181	23	28	16	‡Therefore, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> says:‡“Look, I am laying a stone in Zion,‡an approved stone,‡set in place as a precious cornerstone for the foundation. ‡The one who maintains his faith will not panic.
18182	23	28	17	‡I will make justice the measuring line,‡fairness the plumb line;‡hail will sweep away the unreliable refuge, ‡the floodwaters will overwhelm the hiding place.
18183	23	28	18	‡Your treaty with death will be dissolved; ‡your agreement with Sheol will not last. ‡When the overwhelming judgment sweeps by, ‡you will be overrun by it.
18184	23	28	19	‡Whenever it sweeps by, it will overtake you;‡indeed, every morning it will sweep by,‡it will come through during the day and the night.” ‡When this announcement is understood,‡it will cause nothing but terror.
18185	23	28	20	‡For the bed is too short to stretch out on,‡and the blanket is too narrow to wrap around oneself.
18186	23	28	21	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will rise up, as he did at Mount Perazim, ‡he will rouse himself, as he did in the Valley of Gibeon, ‡to accomplish his work,‡his peculiar work,‡to perform his task,‡his strange task.
18187	23	28	22	‡So now, do not mock,‡or your chains will become heavier!‡For I have heard a message about decreed destruction,‡from the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, against the entire land.
18188	23	28	23	‡Pay attention and listen to my message! ‡Be attentive and listen to what I have to say!
18189	23	28	24	‡Does a farmer just keep on plowing at planting time? ‡Does he keep breaking up and harrowing his ground?
18190	23	28	25	‡Once he has leveled its surface, ‡does he not scatter the seed of the caraway plant,‡sow the seed of the cumin plant,‡and plant the wheat, barley, and grain in their designated places?
18191	23	28	26	‡His God instructs him;‡he teaches him the principles of agriculture.
18192	23	28	27	‡Certainly caraway seed is not threshed with a sledge,‡nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin seed. ‡Certainly caraway seed is beaten with a stick,‡and cumin seed with a flail.
18193	23	28	28	‡Grain is crushed,‡though one certainly does not thresh it forever.‡The wheel of one’s wagon rolls over it,‡but his horses do not crush it.
18194	23	28	29	‡This also comes from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,‡who gives supernatural guidance and imparts great wisdom.
18195	23	29	1	‡Ariel is as good as dead – ‡Ariel, the town David besieged! ‡Keep observing your annual rituals;‡celebrate your festivals on schedule.
18196	23	29	2	‡I will threaten Ariel,‡and she will mourn intensely‡and become like an altar hearth before me.
18197	23	29	3	‡I will lay siege to you on all sides; ‡I will besiege you with troops; ‡I will raise siege works against you.
18198	23	29	4	‡You will fall; ‡while lying on the ground you will speak;‡from the dust where you lie, your words will be heard. ‡Your voice will sound like a spirit speaking from the underworld; ‡from the dust you will chirp as if muttering an incantation.
18199	23	29	5	‡But the horde of invaders will be like fine dust,‡the horde of tyrants like chaff that is blown away.‡It will happen suddenly, in a flash.
18200	23	29	6	‡Judgment will come from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‡accompanied by thunder, earthquake, and a loud noise,‡by a strong gale, a windstorm, and a consuming flame of fire.
18201	23	29	7	‡It will be like a dream, a night vision.‡There will be a horde from all the nations that fight against Ariel,‡those who attack her and her stronghold and besiege her.
18202	23	29	8	‡It will be like a hungry man dreaming that he is eating,‡only to awaken and find that his stomach is empty. ‡It will be like a thirsty man dreaming that he is drinking,‡only to awaken and find that he is still weak and his thirst unquenched. ‡So it will be for the horde from all the nations‡that fight against Mount Zion.
18203	23	29	9	‡You will be shocked and amazed! ‡You are totally blind! ‡They are drunk, but not because of wine;‡they stagger, but not because of beer.
18204	23	29	10	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has poured out on you‡a strong urge to sleep deeply. ‡He has shut your eyes (the prophets),‡and covered your heads (the seers).
18205	23	29	11	¶To you this entire prophetic revelation is like words in a sealed scroll. When they hand it to one who can read and say, “Read this,” he responds, “I can’t, because it is sealed.”
18206	23	29	12	Or when they hand the scroll to one who can’t read and say, “Read this,” he says, “I can’t read.”
18207	23	29	13	‡The Lord says,‡“These people say they are loyal to me; ‡they say wonderful things about me, ‡but they are not really loyal to me. ‡Their worship consists of ‡nothing but man-made ritual.
18208	23	29	14	‡Therefore I will again do an amazing thing for these people – ‡an absolutely extraordinary deed. ‡Wise men will have nothing to say,‡the sages will have no explanations.”
18209	23	29	15	‡Those who try to hide their plans from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> are as good as dead, ‡who do their work in secret and boast, ‡“Who sees us? Who knows what we’re doing?”
18210	23	29	16	‡Your thinking is perverse! ‡Should the potter be regarded as clay? ‡Should the thing made say about its maker, “He didn’t make me”?‡Or should the pottery say about the potter, “He doesn’t understand”?
18211	23	29	17	‡In just a very short time ‡Lebanon will turn into an orchard,‡and the orchard will be considered a forest.
18212	23	29	18	‡At that time the deaf will be able to hear words read from a scroll,‡and the eyes of the blind will be able to see through deep darkness.
18213	23	29	19	‡The downtrodden will again rejoice in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡the poor among humankind will take delight in the Holy One of Israel.
18214	23	29	20	‡For tyrants will disappear,‡those who taunt will vanish,‡and all those who love to do wrong will be eliminated –
18215	23	29	21	‡those who bear false testimony against a person, ‡who entrap the one who arbitrates at the city gate ‡and deprive the innocent of justice by making false charges.
18216	23	29	22	‡So this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the one who delivered Abraham, has said to the family of Jacob: ‡“Jacob will no longer be ashamed;‡their faces will no longer show their embarrassment.
18217	23	29	23	‡For when they see their children,‡whom I will produce among them, ‡they will honor my name.‡They will honor the Holy One of Jacob; ‡they will respect the God of Israel.
18218	23	29	24	‡Those who stray morally will gain understanding; ‡those who complain will acquire insight.
18219	23	30	1	‡“The rebellious children are as good as dead,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡“those who make plans without consulting me, ‡who form alliances without consulting my Spirit, ‡and thereby compound their sin.
18220	23	30	2	‡They travel down to Egypt‡without seeking my will, ‡seeking Pharaoh’s protection,‡and looking for safety in Egypt’s protective shade.
18221	23	30	3	‡But Pharaoh’s protection will bring you nothing but shame,‡and the safety of Egypt’s protective shade nothing but humiliation.
18222	23	30	4	‡Though his officials are in Zoan‡and his messengers arrive at Hanes,
18223	23	30	5	‡all will be put to shame ‡because of a nation that cannot help them,‡who cannot give them aid or help,‡but only shame and disgrace.”
18224	23	30	6	‡This is an oracle about the animals in the Negev:‡Through a land of distress and danger,‡inhabited by lionesses and roaring lions, ‡by snakes and darting adders, ‡they transport their wealth on the backs of donkeys,‡their riches on the humps of camels,‡to a nation that cannot help them.
18225	23	30	7	‡Egypt is totally incapable of helping. ‡For this reason I call her‡‘Proud one who is silenced.’”
18226	23	30	8	‡Now go, write it down on a tablet in their presence, ‡inscribe it on a scroll,‡so that it might be preserved for a future time‡as an enduring witness.
18227	23	30	9	‡For these are rebellious people – ‡they are lying children,‡children unwilling to obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s law.
18228	23	30	10	‡They say to the visionaries, “See no more visions!”‡and to the seers, “Don’t relate messages to us about what is right! ‡Tell us nice things;‡relate deceptive messages.
18229	23	30	11	‡Turn aside from the way;‡stray off the path. ‡Remove from our presence the Holy One of Israel.”
18230	23	30	12	‡For this reason this is what the Holy One of Israel says:‡“You have rejected this message; ‡you trust instead in your ability to oppress and trick, ‡and rely on that kind of behavior.
18231	23	30	13	‡So this sin will become your downfall.‡You will be like a high wall ‡that bulges and cracks and is ready to collapse;‡it crumbles suddenly, in a flash.
18232	23	30	14	‡It shatters in pieces like a clay jar,‡so shattered to bits that none of it can be salvaged. ‡Among its fragments one cannot find a shard large enough ‡to scoop a hot coal from a fire ‡or to skim off water from a cistern.”
18233	23	30	15	‡For this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the Holy One of Israel says:‡“If you repented and patiently waited for me, you would be delivered; ‡if you calmly trusted in me you would find strength, ‡but you are unwilling.
18234	23	30	16	‡You say, ‘No, we will flee on horses,’‡so you will indeed flee.‡You say, ‘We will ride on fast horses,’‡so your pursuers will be fast.
18235	23	30	17	‡One thousand will scurry at the battle cry of one enemy soldier; ‡at the battle cry of five enemy soldiers you will all run away, ‡until the remaining few are as isolated ‡as a flagpole on a mountaintop‡or a signal flag on a hill.”
18236	23	30	18	‡For this reason the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is ready to show you mercy;‡he sits on his throne, ready to have compassion on you. ‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is a just God;‡all who wait for him in faith will be blessed.
18237	23	30	19	‡For people will live in Zion;‡in Jerusalem you will weep no more. ‡When he hears your cry of despair, he will indeed show you mercy;‡when he hears it, he will respond to you.
18238	23	30	20	‡The Lord will give you distress to eat‡and suffering to drink; ‡but your teachers will no longer be hidden;‡your eyes will see them.
18239	23	30	21	‡You will hear a word spoken behind you, saying,‡“This is the correct way, walk in it,”‡whether you are heading to the right or the left.
18240	23	30	22	‡You will desecrate your silver-plated idols ‡and your gold-plated images. ‡You will throw them away as if they were a menstrual rag,‡saying to them, “Get out!”
18241	23	30	23	‡He will water the seed you plant in the ground,‡and the ground will produce crops in abundance. ‡At that time your cattle will graze in wide pastures.
18242	23	30	24	‡The oxen and donkeys used in plowing ‡will eat seasoned feed winnowed with a shovel and pitchfork.
18243	23	30	25	‡On every high mountain‡and every high hill‡there will be streams flowing with water,‡at the time of great slaughter when the fortified towers collapse.
18244	23	30	26	‡The light of the full moon will be like the sun’s glare‡and the sun’s glare will be seven times brighter,‡like the light of seven days, ‡when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> binds up his people’s fractured bones ‡and heals their severe wound.
18245	23	30	27	‡Look, the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> comes from a distant place‡in raging anger and awesome splendor. ‡He speaks angrily‡and his word is like destructive fire.
18246	23	30	28	‡His battle cry overwhelms like a flooding river ‡that reaches one’s neck.‡He shakes the nations in a sieve that isolates the chaff; ‡he puts a bit into the mouth of the nations and leads them to destruction.
18247	23	30	29	‡You will sing‡as you do in the evening when you are celebrating a festival.‡You will be happy like one who plays a flute‡as he goes to the mountain of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the Rock who shelters Israel.
18248	23	30	30	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will give a mighty shout ‡and intervene in power, ‡with furious anger and flaming, destructive fire, ‡with a driving rainstorm and hailstones.
18249	23	30	31	‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s shout will shatter Assyria; ‡he will beat them with a club.
18250	23	30	32	‡Every blow from his punishing cudgel, ‡with which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will beat them, ‡will be accompanied by music from the tambourine and harp,‡and he will attack them with his weapons.
18251	23	30	33	‡For the burial place is already prepared; ‡it has been made deep and wide for the king. ‡The firewood is piled high on it. ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s breath, like a stream flowing with brimstone,‡will ignite it.
18252	23	31	1	‡Those who go down to Egypt for help are as good as dead, ‡those who rely on war horses,‡and trust in Egypt’s many chariots ‡and in their many, many horsemen. ‡But they do not rely on the Holy One of Israel ‡and do not seek help from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18253	23	31	2	‡Yet he too is wise and he will bring disaster;‡he does not retract his decree. ‡He will attack the wicked nation, ‡and the nation that helps those who commit sin.
18254	23	31	3	‡The Egyptians are mere humans, not God;‡their horses are made of flesh, not spirit.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will strike with his hand;‡the one who helps will stumble‡and the one being helped will fall.‡Together they will perish.
18255	23	31	4	‡Indeed, this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said to me:‡“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be like a growling lion,‡like a young lion growling over its prey. ‡Though a whole group of shepherds gathers against it,‡it is not afraid of their shouts‡or intimidated by their yelling. ‡In this same way the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will descend‡to do battle on Mount Zion and on its hill.
18256	23	31	5	‡Just as birds hover over a nest, ‡so the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will protect Jerusalem. ‡He will protect and deliver it;‡as he passes over he will rescue it.
18257	23	31	6	¶You Israelites! Return to the one against whom you have so blatantly rebelled!
18258	23	31	7	For at that time everyone will get rid of the silver and gold idols your hands sinfully made.
18259	23	31	8	‡Assyria will fall by a sword, but not one human-made; ‡a sword not made by humankind will destroy them. ‡They will run away from this sword ‡and their young men will be forced to do hard labor.
18260	23	31	9	‡They will surrender their stronghold because of fear; ‡their officers will be afraid of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s battle flag.” ‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says – ‡the one whose fire is in Zion,‡whose firepot is in Jerusalem.
18261	23	32	1	‡Look, a king will promote fairness; ‡officials will promote justice.
18262	23	32	2	‡Each of them will be like a shelter from the wind‡and a refuge from a rainstorm;‡like streams of water in a dry region‡and like the shade of a large cliff in a parched land.
18263	23	32	3	‡Eyes will no longer be blind ‡and ears will be attentive.
18264	23	32	4	‡The mind that acts rashly will possess discernment ‡and the tongue that stutters will speak with ease and clarity.
18265	23	32	5	‡A fool will no longer be called honorable;‡a deceiver will no longer be called principled.
18266	23	32	6	‡For a fool speaks disgraceful things; ‡his mind plans out sinful deeds. ‡He commits godless deeds ‡and says misleading things about the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡he gives the hungry nothing to satisfy their appetite ‡and gives the thirsty nothing to drink.
18267	23	32	7	‡A deceiver’s methods are evil; ‡he dreams up evil plans ‡to ruin the poor with lies,‡even when the needy are in the right.
18268	23	32	8	‡An honorable man makes honorable plans;‡his honorable character gives him security.
18269	23	32	9	‡You complacent women,‡get up and listen to me!‡You carefree daughters,‡pay attention to what I say!
18270	23	32	10	‡In a year’s time ‡you carefree ones will shake with fear,‡for the grape harvest will fail,‡and the fruit harvest will not arrive.
18271	23	32	11	‡Tremble, you complacent ones!‡Shake with fear, you carefree ones!‡Strip off your clothes and expose yourselves – ‡put sackcloth on your waist!
18272	23	32	12	‡Mourn over the field, ‡over the delightful fields‡and the fruitful vine!
18273	23	32	13	‡Mourn over the land of my people,‡which is overgrown with thorns and briers,‡and over all the once-happy houses ‡in the city filled with revelry.
18274	23	32	14	‡For the fortress is neglected;‡the once-crowded city is abandoned.‡Hill and watchtower‡are permanently uninhabited. ‡Wild donkeys love to go there,‡and flocks graze there.
18275	23	32	15	‡This desolation will continue until new life is poured out on us from heaven. ‡Then the wilderness will become an orchard ‡and the orchard will be considered a forest.
18276	23	32	16	‡Justice will settle down in the wilderness‡and fairness will live in the orchard.
18277	23	32	17	‡Fairness will produce peace ‡and result in lasting security.
18278	23	32	18	‡My people will live in peaceful settlements,‡in secure homes,‡and in safe, quiet places.
18279	23	32	19	‡Even if the forest is destroyed ‡and the city is annihilated,
18280	23	32	20	‡you will be blessed,‡you who plant seed by all the banks of the streams, ‡you who let your ox and donkey graze.
18281	23	33	1	‡The destroyer is as good as dead, ‡you who have not been destroyed!‡The deceitful one is as good as dead, ‡the one whom others have not deceived!‡When you are through destroying, you will be destroyed;‡when you finish deceiving, others will deceive you!
18282	23	33	2	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, be merciful to us! We wait for you.‡Give us strength each morning! ‡Deliver us when distress comes.
18283	23	33	3	‡The nations run away when they hear a loud noise; ‡the nations scatter when you spring into action!
18284	23	33	4	‡Your plunder disappears as if locusts were eating it; ‡they swarm over it like locusts!
18285	23	33	5	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is exalted, ‡indeed, he lives in heaven; ‡he fills Zion with justice and fairness.
18286	23	33	6	‡He is your constant source of stability; ‡he abundantly provides safety and great wisdom; ‡he gives all this to those who fear him.
18287	23	33	7	‡Look, ambassadors cry out in the streets;‡messengers sent to make peace weep bitterly.
18288	23	33	8	‡Highways are empty, ‡there are no travelers. ‡Treaties are broken, ‡witnesses are despised, ‡human life is treated with disrespect.
18289	23	33	9	‡The land dries up and withers away;‡the forest of Lebanon shrivels up and decays.‡Sharon is like the arid rift valley; ‡Bashan and Carmel are parched.
18290	23	33	10	‡“Now I will rise up,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“Now I will exalt myself;‡now I will magnify myself.
18291	23	33	11	‡You conceive straw, ‡you give birth to chaff;‡your breath is a fire that destroys you.
18292	23	33	12	‡The nations will be burned to ashes; ‡like thorn bushes that have been cut down, they will be set on fire.
18293	23	33	13	‡You who are far away, listen to what I have done!‡You who are close by, recognize my strength!”
18294	23	33	14	‡Sinners are afraid in Zion;‡panic grips the godless. ‡They say, ‘Who among us can coexist with destructive fire?‡Who among us can coexist with unquenchable fire?’
18295	23	33	15	‡The one who lives uprightly ‡and speaks honestly;‡the one who refuses to profit from oppressive measures‡and rejects a bribe; ‡the one who does not plot violent crimes ‡and does not seek to harm others –
18296	23	33	16	‡This is the person who will live in a secure place; ‡he will find safety in the rocky, mountain strongholds; ‡he will have food‡and a constant supply of water.
18297	23	33	17	‡You will see a king in his splendor; ‡you will see a wide land.
18298	23	33	18	‡Your mind will recall the terror you experienced, ‡and you will ask yourselves, “Where is the scribe?‡Where is the one who weighs the money?‡Where is the one who counts the towers?”
18299	23	33	19	‡You will no longer see a defiant people‡whose language you do not comprehend, ‡whose derisive speech you do not understand.
18300	23	33	20	‡Look at Zion, the city where we hold religious festivals!‡You will see Jerusalem, ‡a peaceful settlement,‡a tent that stays put; ‡its stakes will never be pulled up;‡none of its ropes will snap in two.
18301	23	33	21	‡Instead the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will rule there as our mighty king. ‡Rivers and wide streams will flow through it; ‡no war galley will enter; ‡no large ships will sail through.

18303	23	33	23	‡Though at this time your ropes are slack, ‡the mast is not secured, ‡and the sail is not unfurled,‡at that time you will divide up a great quantity of loot; ‡even the lame will drag off plunder.
18304	23	33	24	‡No resident of Zion will say, “I am ill”;‡the people who live there will have their sin forgiven.
18305	23	34	1	‡Come near, you nations, and listen!‡Pay attention, you people!‡The earth and everything it contains must listen,‡the world and everything that lives in it.
18306	23	34	2	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is angry at all the nations‡and furious with all their armies.‡He will annihilate them and slaughter them.
18307	23	34	3	‡Their slain will be left unburied, ‡their corpses will stink; ‡the hills will soak up their blood.
18308	23	34	4	‡All the stars in the sky will fade away, ‡the sky will roll up like a scroll;‡all its stars will wither,‡like a leaf withers and falls from a vine‡or a fig withers and falls from a tree.
18309	23	34	5	‡He says, “Indeed, my sword has slaughtered heavenly powers. ‡Look, it now descends on Edom, ‡on the people I will annihilate in judgment.”
18310	23	34	6	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sword is dripping with blood,‡it is covered with fat;‡it drips with the blood of young rams and goats‡and is covered with the fat of rams’ kidneys.‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is holding a sacrifice in Bozrah, ‡a bloody slaughter in the land of Edom.
18311	23	34	7	‡Wild oxen will be slaughtered along with them,‡as well as strong bulls. ‡Their land is drenched with blood,‡their soil is covered with fat.
18312	23	34	8	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has planned a day of revenge, ‡a time when he will repay Edom for her hostility toward Zion.
18313	23	34	9	‡Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch‡and her soil into brimstone;‡her land will become burning pitch.
18314	23	34	10	‡Night and day it will burn; ‡its smoke will ascend continually.‡Generation after generation it will be a wasteland‡and no one will ever pass through it again.
18315	23	34	11	‡Owls and wild animals will live there, ‡all kinds of wild birds will settle in it.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will stretch out over her‡the measuring line of ruin‡and the plumb line of destruction.
18316	23	34	12	‡Her nobles will have nothing left to call a kingdom‡and all her officials will disappear.
18317	23	34	13	‡Her fortresses will be overgrown with thorns;‡thickets and weeds will grow in her fortified cities.‡Jackals will settle there;‡ostriches will live there.
18318	23	34	14	‡Wild animals and wild dogs will congregate there; ‡wild goats will bleat to one another. ‡Yes, nocturnal animals will rest there‡and make for themselves a nest.
18319	23	34	15	‡Owls will make nests and lay eggs there;‡they will hatch them and protect them. ‡Yes, hawks will gather there,‡each with its mate.
18320	23	34	16	‡Carefully read the scroll of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! ‡Not one of these creatures will be missing, ‡none will lack a mate. ‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has issued the decree, ‡and his own spirit gathers them.
18321	23	34	17	‡He assigns them their allotment; ‡he measures out their assigned place. ‡They will live there permanently;‡they will settle in it through successive generations.
18322	23	35	1	‡Let the wilderness and desert be happy; ‡let the arid rift valley rejoice and bloom like a lily!
18323	23	35	2	‡Let it richly bloom; ‡let it rejoice and shout with delight! ‡It is given the grandeur of Lebanon,‡the splendor of Carmel and Sharon.‡They will see the grandeur of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡the splendor of our God.
18324	23	35	3	‡Strengthen the hands that have gone limp,‡steady the knees that shake!
18325	23	35	4	‡Tell those who panic, ‡“Be strong! Do not fear!‡Look, your God comes to avenge!‡With divine retribution he comes to deliver you.”
18326	23	35	5	‡Then blind eyes will open,‡deaf ears will hear.
18327	23	35	6	‡Then the lame will leap like a deer,‡the mute tongue will shout for joy;‡for water will burst forth in the wilderness,‡streams in the arid rift valley.
18328	23	35	7	‡The dry soil will become a pool of water,‡the parched ground springs of water.‡Where jackals once lived and sprawled out,‡grass, reeds, and papyrus will grow.
18329	23	35	8	‡A thoroughfare will be there – ‡it will be called the Way of Holiness. ‡The unclean will not travel on it;‡it is reserved for those authorized to use it – ‡fools will not stray into it.
18330	23	35	9	‡No lions will be there,‡no ferocious wild animals will be on it – ‡they will not be found there.‡Those delivered from bondage will travel on it,
18331	23	35	10	‡those whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has ransomed will return that way. ‡They will enter Zion with a happy shout.‡Unending joy will crown them, ‡happiness and joy will overwhelm them;‡grief and suffering will disappear.
18332	23	36	1	¶In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, King Sennacherib of Assyria marched up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
18333	23	36	2	The king of Assyria sent his chief adviser from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem, along with a large army. The chief adviser stood at the conduit of the upper pool which is located on the road to the field where they wash and dry cloth.
18334	23	36	3	Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went out to meet him.
18335	23	36	4	¶The chief adviser said to them, “Tell Hezekiah: ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: “What is your source of confidence?
18336	23	36	5	Your claim to have a strategy and military strength is just empty talk. In whom are you trusting, that you would dare to rebel against me?
18337	23	36	6	Look, you must be trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed staff. If someone leans on it for support, it punctures his hand and wounds him. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt does to all who trust in him!
18338	23	36	7	Perhaps you will tell me, ‘We are trusting in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.’ But Hezekiah is the one who eliminated his high places and altars and then told the people of Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship at this altar.’
18339	23	36	8	Now make a deal with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, provided you can find enough riders for them.
18340	23	36	9	Certainly you will not refuse one of my master’s minor officials and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen.
18341	23	36	10	Furthermore it was by the command of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that I marched up against this land to destroy it. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me, ‘March up against this land and destroy it!’”’”
18342	23	36	11	¶Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the chief adviser, “Speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak with us in the Judahite dialect in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”
18343	23	36	12	But the chief adviser said, “My master did not send me to speak these words only to your master and to you. His message is also for the men who sit on the wall, for they will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you!”
18344	23	36	13	¶The chief adviser then stood there and called out loudly in the Judahite dialect, “Listen to the message of the great king, the king of Assyria.
18345	23	36	14	This is what the king says: ‘Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you, for he is not able to rescue you!
18346	23	36	15	Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by saying, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will certainly rescue us; this city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”
18347	23	36	16	Don’t listen to Hezekiah!’ For this is what the king of Assyria says, ‘Send me a token of your submission and surrender to me. Then each of you may eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,
18348	23	36	17	until I come and take you to a land just like your own – a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
18349	23	36	18	Hezekiah is misleading you when he says, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will rescue us.” Has any of the gods of the nations rescued his land from the power of the king of Assyria?
18350	23	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, did any gods rescue Samaria from my power?
18351	23	36	20	Who among all the gods of these lands have rescued their lands from my power? So how can the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rescue Jerusalem from my power?’”
18352	23	36	21	They were silent and did not respond, for the king had ordered, “Don’t respond to him.”
18353	23	36	22	¶Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him what the chief adviser had said.
18354	23	37	1	When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
18355	23	37	2	Eliakim the palace supervisor, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, clothed in sackcloth, sent this message to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz:
18356	23	37	3	“This is what Hezekiah says: ‘This is a day of distress, insults, and humiliation, as when a baby is ready to leave the birth canal, but the mother lacks the strength to push it through.
18357	23	37	4	Perhaps the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will hear all these things the chief adviser has spoken on behalf of his master, the king of Assyria, who sent him to taunt the living God. When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God hears, perhaps he will punish him for the things he has said. So pray for this remnant that remains.’”
18358	23	37	5	¶When King Hezekiah’s servants came to Isaiah,
18359	23	37	6	Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master this: ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: “Don’t be afraid because of the things you have heard – these insults the king of Assyria’s servants have hurled against me.
18360	23	37	7	Look, I will take control of his mind; he will receive a report and return to his own land. I will cut him down with a sword in his own land.”’”
18361	23	37	8	¶When the chief adviser heard the king of Assyria had departed from Lachish, he left and went to Libnah, where the king was campaigning.
18362	23	37	9	The king heard that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was marching out to fight him. He again sent messengers to Hezekiah, ordering them:
18363	23	37	10	“Tell King Hezekiah of Judah this: ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust mislead you when he says, “Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”
18364	23	37	11	Certainly you have heard how the kings of Assyria have annihilated all lands. Do you really think you will be rescued?
18365	23	37	12	Were the nations whom my predecessors destroyed – the nations of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden in Telassar – rescued by their gods?
18366	23	37	13	Where are the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”
18367	23	37	14	¶Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and spread it out before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18368	23	37	15	Hezekiah prayed before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord:</span>
18369	23	37	16	“O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, O God of Israel, who is enthroned on the cherubim! You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the sky and the earth.
18370	23	37	17	Pay attention, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and hear! Open your eyes, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and observe! Listen to this entire message Sennacherib sent and how he taunts the living God!
18371	23	37	18	It is true, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the nations and their lands.
18372	23	37	19	They have burned the gods of the nations, for they are not really gods, but only the product of human hands manufactured from wood and stone. That is why the Assyrians could destroy them.
18373	23	37	20	Now, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God, rescue us from his power, so all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
18374	23	37	21	¶Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said: ‘As to what you have prayed to me concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria,
18375	23	37	22	this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says about him: ‡“The virgin daughter Zion ‡despises you – she makes fun of you;‡daughter Jerusalem ‡shakes her head after you.
18376	23	37	23	‡Whom have you taunted and hurled insults at?‡At whom have you shouted‡and looked so arrogantly? ‡At the Holy One of Israel!
18377	23	37	24	‡Through your messengers you taunted the Lord, ‡‘With my many chariots I climbed up‡the high mountains,‡the slopes of Lebanon.‡I cut down its tall cedars‡and its best evergreens.‡I invaded its most remote regions, ‡its thickest woods.
18378	23	37	25	‡I dug wells‡and drank water. ‡With the soles of my feet I dried up‡all the rivers of Egypt.’
18379	23	37	26	‡Certainly you must have heard! ‡Long ago I worked it out,‡in ancient times I planned it,‡and now I am bringing it to pass.‡The plan is this:‡Fortified cities will crash‡into heaps of ruins.
18380	23	37	27	‡Their residents are powerless; ‡they are terrified and ashamed.‡They are as short-lived as plants in the field‡or green vegetation. ‡They are as short-lived as grass on the rooftops ‡when it is scorched by the east wind.
18381	23	37	28	‡I know where you live‡and everything you do‡and how you rage against me.
18382	23	37	29	‡Because you rage against me‡and the uproar you create has reached my ears, ‡I will put my hook in your nose, ‡and my bridle between your lips,‡and I will lead you back ‡the way you came.”
18383	23	37	30	¶“This will be your reminder that I have spoken the truth: This year you will eat what grows wild, and next year what grows on its own. But the year after that you will plant seed and harvest crops; you will plant vines and consume their produce.
18384	23	37	31	Those who remain in Judah will take root in the ground and bear fruit.
18385	23	37	32	‡“For a remnant will leave Jerusalem; ‡survivors will come out of Mount Zion.‡The zeal of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will accomplish this.
18386	23	37	33	‡So this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says about the king of Assyria: ‡‘He will not enter this city,‡nor will he shoot an arrow here. ‡He will not attack it with his shielded warriors, ‡nor will he build siege works against it.
18387	23	37	34	‡He will go back the way he came – ‡he will not enter this city,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
18388	23	37	35	‡I will shield this city and rescue it for the sake of my reputation and because of my promise to David my servant.”’”
18389	23	37	36	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angel went out and killed 185,000 troops in the Assyrian camp. When they got up early the next morning, there were all the corpses!
18390	23	37	37	So King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and went on his way. He went home and stayed in Nineveh.
18391	23	37	38	One day, as he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword. They ran away to the land of Ararat; his son Esarhaddon replaced him as king.
18392	23	38	1	¶In those days Hezekiah was stricken with a terminal illness. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz visited him and told him, “This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘Give instructions to your household, for you are about to die; you will not get well.’”
18393	23	38	2	Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
18394	23	38	3	“Please, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Remember how I have served you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion, and how I have carried out your will.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly.
18395	23	38	4	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Isaiah,
18396	23	38	5	“Go and tell Hezekiah: ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of your ancestor David says: “I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I will add fifteen years to your life,
18397	23	38	6	and rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will shield this city.”’”
18398	23	38	7	Isaiah replied, “This is your sign from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> confirming that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will do what he has said:
18399	23	38	8	Look, I will make the shadow go back ten steps on the stairs of Ahaz.” And then the shadow went back ten steps.
18400	23	38	9	¶This is the prayer of King Hezekiah of Judah when he was sick and then recovered from his illness:
18401	23	38	10	‡“I thought, ‡‘In the middle of my life I must walk through the gates of Sheol,‡I am deprived of the rest of my years.’
18402	23	38	11	‡“I thought,‡‘I will no longer see the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in the land of the living,‡I will no longer look on humankind with the inhabitants of the world.
18403	23	38	12	‡My dwelling place is removed and taken away from me‡like a shepherd’s tent.‡I rolled up my life like a weaver rolls cloth; ‡from the loom he cuts me off. ‡You turn day into night and end my life.
18404	23	38	13	‡I cry out until morning;‡like a lion he shatters all my bones;‡you turn day into night and end my life.
18405	23	38	14	‡Like a swallow or a thrush I chirp,‡I coo like a dove;‡my eyes grow tired from looking up to the sky. ‡O Lord, I am oppressed; ‡help me!
18406	23	38	15	‡What can I say?‡He has decreed and acted. ‡I will walk slowly all my years because I am overcome with grief.
18407	23	38	16	‡O Lord, your decrees can give men life;‡may years of life be restored to me. ‡Restore my health and preserve my life.’
18408	23	38	17	‡“Look, the grief I experienced was for my benefit. ‡You delivered me from the Pit of oblivion. ‡For you removed all my sins from your sight.
18409	23	38	18	‡Indeed Sheol does not give you thanks;‡death does not praise you.‡Those who descend into the Pit do not anticipate your faithfulness.
18410	23	38	19	‡The living person, the living person, he gives you thanks,‡as I do today.‡A father tells his sons about your faithfulness.
18411	23	38	20	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is about to deliver me, ‡and we will celebrate with music ‡for the rest of our lives in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.”
18412	23	38	21	Isaiah ordered, “Let them take a fig cake and apply it to the ulcerated sore and he will get well.”
18413	23	38	22	Hezekiah said, “What is the confirming sign that I will go up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple?”
18414	23	39	1	¶At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered.
18415	23	39	2	Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them his storehouse with its silver, gold, spices, and high-quality olive oil, as well as his whole armory and everything in his treasuries. Hezekiah showed them everything in his palace and in his whole kingdom.
18416	23	39	3	Isaiah the prophet visited King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say? Where do they come from?” Hezekiah replied, “They come from the distant land of Babylon.”
18417	23	39	4	Isaiah asked, “What have they seen in your palace?” Hezekiah replied, “They have seen everything in my palace. I showed them everything in my treasuries.”
18418	23	39	5	Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the message of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies:
18419	23	39	6	‘Look, a time is coming when everything in your palace and the things your ancestors have accumulated to this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18420	23	39	7	‘Some of your very own descendants whom you father will be taken away and will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”
18421	23	39	8	Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message which you have announced is appropriate.” Then he thought, “For there will be peace and stability during my lifetime.”
18422	23	40	1	‡“Comfort, comfort my people,” ‡says your God.
18423	23	40	2	‡“Speak kindly to Jerusalem, and tell her‡that her time of warfare is over, ‡that her punishment is completed. ‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has made her pay double for all her sins.”
18424	23	40	3	‡A voice cries out,‡“In the wilderness clear a way for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡build a level road through the rift valley for our God.
18425	23	40	4	‡Every valley must be elevated,‡and every mountain and hill leveled.‡The rough terrain will become a level plain,‡the rugged landscape a wide valley.
18426	23	40	5	‡The splendor of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be revealed,‡and all people will see it at the same time.‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has decreed it.”
18427	23	40	6	‡A voice says, “Cry out!”‡Another asks, “What should I cry out?”‡The first voice responds: “All people are like grass, ‡and all their promises are like the flowers in the field.
18428	23	40	7	‡The grass dries up,‡the flowers wither,‡when the wind sent by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> blows on them.‡Surely humanity is like grass.
18429	23	40	8	‡The grass dries up,‡the flowers wither,‡but the decree of our God is forever reliable.”
18430	23	40	9	‡Go up on a high mountain, O herald Zion!‡Shout out loudly, O herald Jerusalem! ‡Shout, don’t be afraid!‡Say to the towns of Judah,‡“Here is your God!”
18431	23	40	10	‡Look, the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> comes as a victorious warrior; ‡his military power establishes his rule. ‡Look, his reward is with him;‡his prize goes before him.
18432	23	40	11	‡Like a shepherd he tends his flock;‡he gathers up the lambs with his arm;‡he carries them close to his heart; ‡he leads the ewes along.
18433	23	40	12	‡Who has measured out the waters in the hollow of his hand,‡or carefully measured the sky, ‡or carefully weighed the soil of the earth,‡or weighed the mountains in a balance,‡or the hills on scales?
18434	23	40	13	‡Who comprehends the mind of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡or gives him instruction as his counselor?
18435	23	40	14	‡From whom does he receive directions? ‡Who teaches him the correct way to do things, ‡or imparts knowledge to him,‡or instructs him in skillful design?
18436	23	40	15	‡Look, the nations are like a drop in a bucket;‡they are regarded as dust on the scales.‡He lifts the coastlands as if they were dust.
18437	23	40	16	‡Not even Lebanon could supply enough firewood for a sacrifice; ‡its wild animals would not provide enough burnt offerings.
18438	23	40	17	‡All the nations are insignificant before him;‡they are regarded as absolutely nothing.
18439	23	40	18	‡To whom can you compare God?‡To what image can you liken him?
18440	23	40	19	‡A craftsman casts an idol;‡a metalsmith overlays it with gold‡and forges silver chains for it.
18441	23	40	20	‡To make a contribution one selects wood that will not rot; ‡he then seeks a skilled craftsman‡to make an idol that will not fall over.
18442	23	40	21	‡Do you not know?‡Do you not hear?‡Has it not been told to you since the very beginning?‡Have you not understood from the time the earth’s foundations were made?
18443	23	40	22	‡He is the one who sits on the earth’s horizon; ‡its inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him. ‡He is the one who stretches out the sky like a thin curtain, ‡and spreads it out like a pitched tent.
18444	23	40	23	‡He is the one who reduces rulers to nothing;‡he makes the earth’s leaders insignificant.
18445	23	40	24	‡Indeed, they are barely planted;‡yes, they are barely sown;‡yes, they barely take root in the earth,‡and then he blows on them, causing them to dry up,‡and the wind carries them away like straw.
18446	23	40	25	‡“To whom can you compare me? Whom do I resemble?”‡says the Holy One.
18447	23	40	26	‡Look up at the sky! ‡Who created all these heavenly lights? ‡He is the one who leads out their ranks; ‡he calls them all by name.‡Because of his absolute power and awesome strength,‡not one of them is missing.
18448	23	40	27	‡Why do you say, Jacob,‡Why do you say, Israel,‡“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is not aware of what is happening to me, ‡My God is not concerned with my vindication”?
18449	23	40	28	‡Do you not know?‡Have you not heard?‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is an eternal God,‡the Creator of the whole earth. ‡He does not get tired or weary;‡there is no limit to his wisdom.
18450	23	40	29	‡He gives strength to those who are tired;‡to the ones who lack power, he gives renewed energy.
18451	23	40	30	‡Even youths get tired and weary;‡even strong young men clumsily stumble.
18452	23	40	31	‡But those who wait for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s help find renewed strength;‡they rise up as if they had eagles’ wings, ‡they run without growing weary,‡they walk without getting tired.
18453	23	41	1	‡“Listen to me in silence, you coastlands! ‡Let the nations find renewed strength!‡Let them approach and then speak;‡let us come together for debate!
18454	23	41	2	‡Who stirs up this one from the east? ‡Who officially commissions him for service? ‡He hands nations over to him, ‡and enables him to subdue kings.‡He makes them like dust with his sword,‡like windblown straw with his bow.
18455	23	41	3	‡He pursues them and passes by unharmed; ‡he advances with great speed.
18456	23	41	4	‡Who acts and carries out decrees? ‡Who summons the successive generations from the beginning?‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, am present at the very beginning,‡and at the very end – I am the one.
18457	23	41	5	‡The coastlands see and are afraid;‡the whole earth trembles;‡they approach and come.
18458	23	41	6	‡They help one another; ‡one says to the other, ‘Be strong!’
18459	23	41	7	‡The craftsman encourages the metalsmith,‡the one who wields the hammer encourages the one who pounds on the anvil.‡He approves the quality of the welding, ‡and nails it down so it won’t fall over.”
18460	23	41	8	‡“You, my servant Israel,‡Jacob whom I have chosen,‡offspring of Abraham my friend,
18461	23	41	9	‡you whom I am bringing back from the earth’s extremities,‡and have summoned from the remote regions – ‡I told you, “You are my servant.”‡I have chosen you and not rejected you.

18463	23	41	11	‡Look, all who were angry at you will be ashamed and humiliated;‡your adversaries will be reduced to nothing and perish.
18464	23	41	12	‡When you will look for your opponents, you will not find them;‡your enemies will be reduced to absolutely nothing.
18465	23	41	13	‡For I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,‡the one who takes hold of your right hand,‡who says to you, ‘Don’t be afraid, I am helping you.’
18466	23	41	14	‡Don’t be afraid, despised insignificant Jacob, ‡men of Israel.‡I am helping you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡your protector, the Holy One of Israel.
18467	23	41	15	‡“Look, I am making you like a sharp threshing sledge,‡new and double-edged. ‡You will thresh the mountains and crush them;‡you will make the hills like straw.
18468	23	41	16	‡You will winnow them and the wind will blow them away;‡the wind will scatter them.‡You will rejoice in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡you will boast in the Holy One of Israel.
18469	23	41	17	‡The oppressed and the poor look for water, but there is none;‡their tongues are parched from thirst.‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, will respond to their prayers; ‡I, the God of Israel, will not abandon them.
18470	23	41	18	‡I will make streams flow down the slopes‡and produce springs in the middle of the valleys.‡I will turn the wilderness into a pool of water‡and the arid land into springs.
18471	23	41	19	‡I will make cedars, acacias, myrtles, and olive trees grow in the wilderness;‡I will make evergreens, firs, and cypresses grow together in the arid rift valley.
18472	23	41	20	‡I will do this so people will observe and recognize,‡so they will pay attention and understand‡that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s power has accomplished this,‡and that the Holy One of Israel has brought it into being.”
18473	23	41	21	‡“Present your argument,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“Produce your evidence,” says Jacob’s king.
18474	23	41	22	‡“Let them produce evidence! Let them tell us what will happen!‡Tell us about your earlier predictive oracles, ‡so we may examine them and see how they were fulfilled. ‡Or decree for us some future events!
18475	23	41	23	‡Predict how future events will turn out, ‡so we might know you are gods.‡Yes, do something good or bad, ‡so we might be frightened and in awe.
18476	23	41	24	‡Look, you are nothing, and your accomplishments are nonexistent;‡the one who chooses to worship you is disgusting.
18477	23	41	25	‡I have stirred up one out of the north and he advances,‡one from the eastern horizon who prays in my name. ‡He steps on rulers as if they were clay,‡like a potter treading the clay.
18478	23	41	26	‡Who decreed this from the beginning, so we could know?‡Who announced it ahead of time, so we could say, ‘He’s correct’?‡Indeed, none of them decreed it!‡Indeed, none of them announced it!‡Indeed, no one heard you say anything!
18479	23	41	27	‡I first decreed to Zion, ‘Look, here’s what will happen!’ ‡I sent a herald to Jerusalem.
18480	23	41	28	‡I look, but there is no one,‡among them there is no one who serves as an adviser,‡that I might ask questions and receive answers.
18481	23	41	29	‡Look, all of them are nothing, ‡their accomplishments are nonexistent;‡their metal images lack any real substance.
18482	23	42	1	‡“Here is my servant whom I support,‡my chosen one in whom I take pleasure.‡I have placed my Spirit on him;‡he will make just decrees for the nations.

18486	23	42	5	‡This is what the true God, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, says – ‡the one who created the sky and stretched it out,‡the one who fashioned the earth and everything that lives on it, ‡the one who gives breath to the people on it,‡and life to those who live on it:

18491	23	42	10	‡Sing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> a brand new song!‡Praise him from the horizon of the earth,‡you who go down to the sea, and everything that lives in it, ‡you coastlands and those who live there!
18492	23	42	11	‡Let the wilderness and its cities shout out,‡the towns where the nomads of Kedar live!‡Let the residents of Sela shout joyfully;‡let them shout loudly from the mountaintops.
18493	23	42	12	‡Let them give the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> the honor he deserves; ‡let them praise his deeds in the coastlands.
18494	23	42	13	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> emerges like a hero,‡like a warrior he inspires himself for battle; ‡he shouts, yes, he yells,‡he shows his enemies his power.
18495	23	42	14	‡“I have been inactive for a long time;‡I kept quiet and held back.‡Like a woman in labor I groan;‡I pant and gasp.
18496	23	42	15	‡I will make the trees on the mountains and hills wither up; ‡I will dry up all their vegetation.‡I will turn streams into islands, ‡and dry up pools of water.
18497	23	42	16	‡I will lead the blind along an unfamiliar way; ‡I will guide them down paths they have never traveled. ‡I will turn the darkness in front of them into light,‡and level out the rough ground. ‡This is what I will do for them.‡I will not abandon them.
18498	23	42	17	‡Those who trust in idols‡will turn back and be utterly humiliated, ‡those who say to metal images, ‘You are our gods.’”
18499	23	42	18	‡“Listen, you deaf ones!‡Take notice, you blind ones!
18500	23	42	19	‡My servant is truly blind,‡my messenger is truly deaf.‡My covenant partner, the servant of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, is truly blind.
18501	23	42	20	‡You see many things, but don’t comprehend; ‡their ears are open, but do not hear.”
18502	23	42	21	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> wanted to exhibit his justice‡by magnifying his law and displaying it.
18503	23	42	22	‡But these people are looted and plundered;‡all of them are trapped in pits ‡and held captive in prisons.‡They were carried away as loot with no one to rescue them;‡they were carried away as plunder, and no one says, “Bring that back!”
18504	23	42	23	‡Who among you will pay attention to this?‡Who will listen attentively in the future?
18505	23	42	24	‡Who handed Jacob over to the robber?‡Who handed Israel over to the looters? ‡Was it not the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, against whom we sinned?‡They refused to follow his commands;‡they disobeyed his law.
18506	23	42	25	‡So he poured out his fierce anger on them, ‡along with the devastation of war.‡Its flames encircled them, but they did not realize it; ‡it burned against them, but they did not take it to heart.
18507	23	43	1	‡Now, this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡the one who created you, O Jacob,‡and formed you, O Israel:‡“Don’t be afraid, for I will protect you.‡I call you by name, you are mine.
18508	23	43	2	‡When you pass through the waters, I am with you;‡when you pass through the streams, they will not overwhelm you.‡When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned;‡the flames will not harm you.
18509	23	43	3	‡For I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,‡the Holy One of Israel, your deliverer.‡I have handed over Egypt as a ransom price,‡Ethiopia and Seba in place of you.
18510	23	43	4	‡Since you are precious and special in my sight, ‡and I love you,‡I will hand over people in place of you,‡nations in place of your life.
18511	23	43	5	‡Don’t be afraid, for I am with you.‡From the east I will bring your descendants;‡from the west I will gather you.
18512	23	43	6	‡I will say to the north, ‘Hand them over!’‡and to the south, ‘Don’t hold any back!’‡Bring my sons from distant lands,‡and my daughters from the remote regions of the earth,
18513	23	43	7	‡everyone who belongs to me, ‡whom I created for my glory,‡whom I formed – yes, whom I made!
18514	23	43	8	‡Bring out the people who are blind, even though they have eyes,‡those who are deaf, even though they have ears!
18515	23	43	9	‡All nations gather together,‡the peoples assemble.‡Who among them announced this?‡Who predicted earlier events for us? ‡Let them produce their witnesses to testify they were right;‡let them listen and affirm, ‘It is true.’
18516	23	43	10	‡You are my witnesses,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡“my servant whom I have chosen,‡so that you may consider and believe in me,‡and understand that I am he.‡No god was formed before me,‡and none will outlive me.
18517	23	43	11	‡I, I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡and there is no deliverer besides me.
18518	23	43	12	‡I decreed and delivered and proclaimed,‡and there was no other god among you.‡You are my witnesses,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “that I am God.
18519	23	43	13	‡From this day forward I am he;‡no one can deliver from my power; ‡I will act, and who can prevent it?”
18520	23	43	14	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡your protector, the Holy One of Israel: ‡“For your sake I send to Babylon‡and make them all fugitives, ‡turning the Babylonians’ joyful shouts into mourning songs.
18521	23	43	15	‡I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, your Holy One, ‡the one who created Israel, your king.”
18522	23	43	16	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡the one who made a road through the sea,‡a pathway through the surging waters,
18523	23	43	17	‡the one who led chariots and horses to destruction, ‡together with a mighty army.‡They fell down, never to rise again;‡they were extinguished, put out like a burning wick:
18524	23	43	18	‡“Don’t remember these earlier events; ‡don’t recall these former events.‡
18525	23	43	19	‡“Look, I am about to do something new.‡Now it begins to happen! Do you not recognize it?‡Yes, I will make a road in the wilderness‡and paths in the wastelands.
18526	23	43	20	‡The wild animals honor me,‡the jackals and ostriches,‡because I put water in the wilderness‡and streams in the wastelands,‡to quench the thirst of my chosen people,
18527	23	43	21	‡the people whom I formed for myself,‡so they might praise me.”
18528	23	43	22	‡“But you did not call for me, O Jacob;‡you did not long for me, O Israel.
18529	23	43	23	‡You did not bring me lambs for your burnt offerings;‡you did not honor me with your sacrifices.‡I did not burden you with offerings;‡I did not make you weary by demanding incense.
18530	23	43	24	‡You did not buy me aromatic reeds; ‡you did not present to me the fat of your sacrifices.‡Yet you burdened me with your sins;‡you made me weary with your evil deeds.
18531	23	43	25	‡I, I am the one who blots out your rebellious deeds for my sake;‡your sins I do not remember.
18532	23	43	26	‡Remind me of what happened! Let’s debate!‡You, prove to me that you are right!
18533	23	43	27	‡The father of your nation sinned;‡your spokesmen rebelled against me.
18534	23	43	28	‡So I defiled your holy princes,‡and handed Jacob over to destruction,‡and subjected Israel to humiliating abuse.”
18535	23	44	1	‡“Now, listen, Jacob my servant,‡Israel whom I have chosen!”
18536	23	44	2	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the one who made you, says – ‡the one who formed you in the womb and helps you:‡“Don’t be afraid, my servant Jacob,‡Jeshurun, whom I have chosen!
18537	23	44	3	‡For I will pour water on the parched ground ‡and cause streams to flow on the dry land.‡I will pour my Spirit on your offspring‡and my blessing on your children.
18538	23	44	4	‡They will sprout up like a tree in the grass, ‡like poplars beside channels of water.
18539	23	44	5	‡One will say, ‘I belong to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,’‡and another will use the name ‘Jacob.’‡One will write on his hand, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s,’‡and use the name ‘Israel.’”
18540	23	44	6	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, Israel’s king, says,‡their protector, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies:‡“I am the first and I am the last,‡there is no God but me.
18541	23	44	7	‡Who is like me? Let him make his claim! ‡Let him announce it and explain it to me – ‡since I established an ancient people – ‡let them announce future events!
18542	23	44	8	‡Don’t panic! Don’t be afraid! ‡Did I not tell you beforehand and decree it?‡You are my witnesses! Is there any God but me?‡There is no other sheltering rock; I know of none.
18543	23	44	9	‡All who form idols are nothing;‡the things in which they delight are worthless.‡Their witnesses cannot see;‡they recognize nothing, so they are put to shame.
18544	23	44	10	‡Who forms a god and casts an idol‡that will prove worthless?
18545	23	44	11	‡Look, all his associates will be put to shame;‡the craftsmen are mere humans. ‡Let them all assemble and take their stand!‡They will panic and be put to shame.
18546	23	44	12	‡A blacksmith works with his tool ‡and forges metal over the coals.‡He forms it with hammers;‡he makes it with his strong arm.‡He gets hungry and loses his energy; ‡he drinks no water and gets tired.
18547	23	44	13	‡A carpenter takes measurements; ‡he marks out an outline of its form; ‡he scrapes it with chisels,‡and marks it with a compass.‡He patterns it after the human form, ‡like a well-built human being,‡and puts it in a shrine.
18548	23	44	14	‡He cuts down cedars‡and acquires a cypress or an oak.‡He gets trees from the forest;‡he plants a cedar and the rain makes it grow.
18549	23	44	15	‡A man uses it to make a fire; ‡he takes some of it and warms himself.‡Yes, he kindles a fire and bakes bread.‡Then he makes a god and worships it;‡he makes an idol and bows down to it.
18550	23	44	16	‡Half of it he burns in the fire – ‡over that half he cooks meat;‡he roasts a meal and fills himself.‡Yes, he warms himself and says,‡‘Ah! I am warm as I look at the fire.’
18551	23	44	17	‡With the rest of it he makes a god, his idol;‡he bows down to it and worships it.‡He prays to it, saying,‡‘Rescue me, for you are my god!’
18552	23	44	18	‡They do not comprehend or understand,‡for their eyes are blind and cannot see;‡their minds do not discern.
18553	23	44	19	‡No one thinks to himself,‡nor do they comprehend or understand and say to themselves:‡‘I burned half of it in the fire – ‡yes, I baked bread over the coals;‡I roasted meat and ate it.‡With the rest of it should I make a disgusting idol?‡Should I bow down to dry wood?’
18554	23	44	20	‡He feeds on ashes; ‡his deceived mind misleads him.‡He cannot rescue himself,‡nor does he say, ‘Is this not a false god I hold in my right hand?’
18555	23	44	21	‡Remember these things, O Jacob,‡O Israel, for you are my servant.‡I formed you to be my servant;‡O Israel, I will not forget you!
18556	23	44	22	‡I remove the guilt of your rebellious deeds as if they were a cloud,‡the guilt of your sins as if they were a cloud. ‡Come back to me, for I protect you.”
18557	23	44	23	‡Shout for joy, O sky, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> intervenes; ‡shout out, you subterranean regions of the earth.‡O mountains, give a joyful shout;‡you too, O forest and all your trees! ‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> protects Jacob;‡he reveals his splendor through Israel.
18558	23	44	24	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, your protector, says,‡the one who formed you in the womb:‡“I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who made everything,‡who alone stretched out the sky,‡who fashioned the earth all by myself,
18559	23	44	25	‡who frustrates the omens of the empty talkers ‡and humiliates the omen readers,‡who overturns the counsel of the wise men ‡and makes their advice seem foolish,
18560	23	44	26	‡who fulfills the oracles of his prophetic servants ‡and brings to pass the announcements of his messengers,‡who says about Jerusalem, ‘She will be inhabited,’‡and about the towns of Judah, ‘They will be rebuilt,‡her ruins I will raise up,’
18561	23	44	27	‡who says to the deep sea, ‘Be dry!‡I will dry up your sea currents,’
18562	23	44	28	‡who commissions Cyrus, the one I appointed as shepherd ‡to carry out all my wishes ‡and to decree concerning Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’‡and concerning the temple, ‘It will be reconstructed.’”
18563	23	45	1	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to his chosen one, ‡to Cyrus, whose right hand I hold ‡in order to subdue nations before him,‡and disarm kings, ‡to open doors before him,‡so gates remain unclosed:‡
18564	23	45	2	‡“I will go before you‡and level mountains. ‡Bronze doors I will shatter‡and iron bars I will hack through.
18565	23	45	3	‡I will give you hidden treasures, ‡riches stashed away in secret places,‡so you may recognize that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡the one who calls you by name, the God of Israel.
18566	23	45	4	‡For the sake of my servant Jacob,‡Israel, my chosen one,‡I call you by name‡and give you a title of respect, even though you do not submit to me.
18567	23	45	5	‡I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I have no peer, ‡there is no God but me.‡I arm you for battle, even though you do not recognize me.
18568	23	45	6	‡I do this so people will recognize from east to west‡that there is no God but me;‡I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I have no peer.
18569	23	45	7	‡I am the one who forms light‡and creates darkness; ‡the one who brings about peace‡and creates calamity. ‡I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who accomplishes all these things.
18570	23	45	8	‡O sky, rain down from above!‡Let the clouds send down showers of deliverance!‡Let the earth absorb it so salvation may grow, ‡and deliverance may sprout up along with it.‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, create it.
18571	23	45	9	‡One who argues with his Creator is in grave danger, ‡one who is like a mere shard among the other shards on the ground!‡The clay should not say to the potter, ‡“What in the world are you doing?‡Your work lacks skill!”
18572	23	45	10	‡Danger awaits one who says to his father,‡“What in the world are you fathering?”‡and to his mother,‡“What in the world are you bringing forth?”
18573	23	45	11	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡the Holy One of Israel, the one who formed him,‡concerning things to come: ‡“How dare you question me about my children!‡How dare you tell me what to do with the work of my own hands!
18574	23	45	12	‡I made the earth;‡I created the people who live on it.‡It was me – my hands stretched out the sky. ‡I give orders to all the heavenly lights.
18575	23	45	13	‡It is me – I stir him up and commission him; ‡I will make all his ways level.‡He will rebuild my city;‡he will send my exiled people home,‡but not for a price or a bribe,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
18576	23	45	14	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“The profit of Egypt and the revenue of Ethiopia, ‡along with the Sabeans, those tall men,‡will be brought to you and become yours.‡They will walk behind you, coming along in chains. ‡They will bow down to you‡and pray to you: ‡‘Truly God is with you; he has no peer; ‡there is no other God!’”
18577	23	45	15	‡Yes, you are a God who keeps hidden,‡O God of Israel, deliverer!
18578	23	45	16	‡They will all be ashamed and embarrassed;‡those who fashion idols will all be humiliated.
18579	23	45	17	‡Israel will be delivered once and for all by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; ‡you will never again be ashamed or humiliated.
18580	23	45	18	‡For this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡the one who created the sky – ‡he is the true God, ‡the one who formed the earth and made it;‡he established it,‡he did not create it without order, ‡he formed it to be inhabited – ‡“I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I have no peer.
18581	23	45	19	‡I have not spoken in secret,‡in some hidden place. ‡I did not tell Jacob’s descendants,‡‘Seek me in vain!’ ‡I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡the one who speaks honestly,‡who makes reliable announcements.
18582	23	45	20	‡Gather together and come!‡Approach together, you refugees from the nations!‡Those who carry wooden idols know nothing,‡those who pray to a god that cannot deliver.
18583	23	45	21	‡Tell me! Present the evidence! ‡Let them consult with one another!‡Who predicted this in the past?‡Who announced it beforehand?‡Was it not I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?‡I have no peer, there is no God but me,‡a God who vindicates and delivers; ‡there is none but me.
18584	23	45	22	‡Turn to me so you can be delivered, ‡all you who live in the earth’s remote regions!‡For I am God, and I have no peer.
18585	23	45	23	‡I solemnly make this oath – ‡what I say is true and reliable: ‡‘Surely every knee will bow to me,‡every tongue will solemnly affirm;
18586	23	45	24	‡they will say about me,‡“Yes, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is a powerful deliverer.”’” ‡All who are angry at him will cower before him.
18587	23	45	25	‡All the descendants of Israel will be vindicated by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡and will boast in him.
18588	23	46	1	‡Bel kneels down,‡Nebo bends low. ‡Their images weigh down animals and beasts. ‡Your heavy images are burdensome to tired animals.
18589	23	46	2	‡Together they bend low and kneel down;‡they are unable to rescue the images; ‡they themselves head off into captivity.
18590	23	46	3	‡“Listen to me, O family of Jacob, ‡all you who are left from the family of Israel, ‡you who have been carried from birth, ‡you who have been supported from the time you left the womb.
18591	23	46	4	‡Even when you are old, I will take care of you, ‡even when you have gray hair, I will carry you.‡I made you and I will support you;‡I will carry you and rescue you.
18592	23	46	5	‡To whom can you compare and liken me?‡Tell me whom you think I resemble, so we can be compared!
18593	23	46	6	‡Those who empty out gold from a purse‡and weigh out silver on the scale ‡hire a metalsmith, who makes it into a god.‡They then bow down and worship it.
18594	23	46	7	‡They put it on their shoulder and carry it;‡they put it in its place and it just stands there;‡it does not move from its place.‡Even when someone cries out to it, it does not reply;‡it does not deliver him from his distress.
18595	23	46	8	‡Remember this, so you can be brave! ‡Think about it, you rebels!
18596	23	46	9	‡Remember what I accomplished in antiquity! ‡Truly I am God, I have no peer; ‡I am God, and there is none like me,

18598	23	46	11	‡who summons an eagle from the east,‡from a distant land, one who carries out my plan.‡Yes, I have decreed, ‡yes, I will bring it to pass;‡I have formulated a plan,‡yes, I will carry it out.
18599	23	46	12	‡Listen to me, you stubborn people, ‡you who distance yourself from doing what is right.
18600	23	46	13	‡I am bringing my deliverance near, it is not far away;‡I am bringing my salvation near, it does not wait.‡I will save Zion; ‡I will adorn Israel with my splendor.”
18601	23	47	1	‡“Fall down! Sit in the dirt,‡O virgin daughter Babylon!‡Sit on the ground, not on a throne,‡O daughter of the Babylonians!‡Indeed, you will no longer be called delicate and pampered.
18602	23	47	2	‡Pick up millstones and grind flour!‡Remove your veil,‡strip off your skirt,‡expose your legs,‡cross the streams!

18606	23	47	6	‡I was angry at my people;‡I defiled my special possession‡and handed them over to you.‡You showed them no mercy; ‡you even placed a very heavy burden on old people.
18607	23	47	7	‡You said,‡‘I will rule forever as permanent queen!’ ‡You did not think about these things; ‡you did not consider how it would turn out.
18608	23	47	8	‡So now, listen to this,‡O one who lives so lavishly, ‡who lives securely,‡who says to herself, ‡‘I am unique! No one can compare to me! ‡I will never have to live as a widow;‡I will never lose my children.’
18609	23	47	9	‡Both of these will come upon you‡suddenly, in one day!‡You will lose your children and be widowed. ‡You will be overwhelmed by these tragedies, ‡despite your many incantations‡and your numerous amulets.
18610	23	47	10	‡You were complacent in your evil deeds; ‡you thought, ‘No one sees me.’‡Your self-professed wisdom and knowledge lead you astray,‡when you say, ‘I am unique! No one can compare to me!’
18611	23	47	11	‡Disaster will overtake you;‡you will not know how to charm it away. ‡Destruction will fall on you;‡you will not be able to appease it.‡Calamity will strike you suddenly,‡before you recognize it.
18612	23	47	12	‡Persist in trusting your amulets‡and your many incantations,‡which you have faithfully recited since your youth!‡Maybe you will be successful – ‡maybe you will scare away disaster.
18613	23	47	13	‡You are tired out from listening to so much advice. ‡Let them take their stand – ‡the ones who see omens in the sky,‡who gaze at the stars,‡who make monthly predictions – ‡let them rescue you from the disaster that is about to overtake you!
18614	23	47	14	‡Look, they are like straw,‡which the fire burns up;‡they cannot rescue themselves‡from the heat of the flames.‡There are no coals to warm them,‡no firelight to enjoy.
18615	23	47	15	‡They will disappoint you, ‡those you have so faithfully dealt with since your youth. ‡Each strays off in his own direction, ‡leaving no one to rescue you.”
18616	23	48	1	‡Listen to this, O family of Jacob, ‡you who are called by the name ‘Israel,’‡and are descended from Judah, ‡who take oaths in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡and invoke the God of Israel – ‡but not in an honest and just manner.
18617	23	48	2	‡Indeed, they live in the holy city; ‡they trust in the God of Israel,‡whose name is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
18618	23	48	3	‡“I announced events beforehand, ‡I issued the decrees and made the predictions; ‡suddenly I acted and they came to pass.
18619	23	48	4	‡I did this because I know how stubborn you are.‡Your neck muscles are like iron‡and your forehead like bronze.
18620	23	48	5	‡I announced them to you beforehand;‡before they happened, I predicted them for you,‡so you could never say,‡‘My image did these things,‡my idol, my cast image, decreed them.’

18622	23	48	7	‡Now they come into being, not in the past;‡before today you did not hear about them,‡so you could not say,‡‘Yes, I know about them.’
18623	23	48	8	‡You did not hear,‡you do not know,‡you were not told beforehand. ‡For I know that you are very deceitful; ‡you were labeled a rebel from birth.

18625	23	48	10	‡Look, I have refined you, but not as silver;‡I have purified you in the furnace of misery.
18626	23	48	11	‡For my sake alone I will act,‡for how can I allow my name to be defiled? ‡I will not share my glory with anyone else!
18627	23	48	12	‡Listen to me, O Jacob,‡Israel, whom I summoned!‡I am the one;‡I am present at the very beginning‡and at the very end.
18628	23	48	13	‡Yes, my hand founded the earth;‡my right hand spread out the sky.‡I summon them;‡they stand together.
18629	23	48	14	‡All of you, gather together and listen!‡Who among them announced these things?‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s ally will carry out his desire against Babylon;‡he will exert his power against the Babylonians.
18630	23	48	15	‡I, I have spoken – ‡yes, I have summoned him;‡I lead him and he will succeed.
18631	23	48	16	‡Approach me! Listen to this!‡From the very first I have not spoken in secret;‡when it happens, I am there.”‡So now, the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent me, accompanied by his Spirit.
18632	23	48	17	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, your protector, says,‡the Holy One of Israel: ‡“I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,‡who teaches you how to succeed,‡who leads you in the way you should go.
18633	23	48	18	‡If only you had obeyed my commandments,‡prosperity would have flowed to you like a river, ‡deliverance would have come to you like the waves of the sea.
18634	23	48	19	‡Your descendants would have been as numerous as sand, ‡and your children like its granules.‡Their name would not have been cut off‡and eliminated from my presence.
18635	23	48	20	‡Leave Babylon!‡Flee from the Babylonians!‡Announce it with a shout of joy!‡Make this known!‡Proclaim it throughout the earth! ‡Say, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> protects his servant Jacob.
18636	23	48	21	‡They do not thirst as he leads them through dry regions;‡he makes water flow out of a rock for them;‡he splits open a rock and water flows out.’
18637	23	48	22	‡There will be no prosperity for the wicked,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18638	23	49	1	‡Listen to me, you coastlands! ‡Pay attention, you people who live far away!‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> summoned me from birth; ‡he commissioned me when my mother brought me into the world.
18639	23	49	2	‡He made my mouth like a sharp sword,‡he hid me in the hollow of his hand;‡he made me like a sharpened arrow,‡he hid me in his quiver.
18640	23	49	3	‡He said to me, “You are my servant,‡Israel, through whom I will reveal my splendor.”
18641	23	49	4	‡But I thought, “I have worked in vain;‡I have expended my energy for absolutely nothing.” ‡But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will vindicate me;‡my God will reward me.
18642	23	49	5	‡So now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡the one who formed me from birth to be his servant – ‡he did this to restore Jacob to himself,‡so that Israel might be gathered to him;‡and I will be honored in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight,‡for my God is my source of strength –
18643	23	49	6	‡he says, “Is it too insignificant a task for you to be my servant,‡to reestablish the tribes of Jacob,‡and restore the remnant of Israel? ‡I will make you a light to the nations, ‡so you can bring my deliverance to the remote regions of the earth.”
18644	23	49	7	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡the protector of Israel, their Holy One, says‡to the one who is despised and rejected by nations, ‡a servant of rulers:‡“Kings will see and rise in respect, ‡princes will bow down,‡because of the faithful <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡the Holy One of Israel who has chosen you.”
18645	23	49	8	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“At the time I decide to show my favor, I will respond to you;‡in the day of deliverance I will help you;‡I will protect you and make you a covenant mediator for people, ‡to rebuild the land ‡and to reassign the desolate property.
18646	23	49	9	‡You will say to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’‡and to those who are in dark dungeons, ‘Emerge.’ ‡They will graze beside the roads;‡on all the slopes they will find pasture.
18647	23	49	10	‡They will not be hungry or thirsty;‡the sun’s oppressive heat will not beat down on them, ‡for one who has compassion on them will guide them;‡he will lead them to springs of water.
18648	23	49	11	‡I will make all my mountains into a road;‡I will construct my roadways.”
18649	23	49	12	‡Look, they come from far away!‡Look, some come from the north and west,‡and others from the land of Sinim!
18650	23	49	13	‡Shout for joy, O sky! ‡Rejoice, O earth!‡Let the mountains give a joyful shout!‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> consoles his people‡and shows compassion to the oppressed.
18651	23	49	14	‡“Zion said, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has abandoned me,‡the Lord has forgotten me.’
18652	23	49	15	‡Can a woman forget her baby who nurses at her breast? ‡Can she withhold compassion from the child she has borne? ‡Even if mothers were to forget,‡I could never forget you!
18653	23	49	16	‡Look, I have inscribed your name on my palms;‡your walls are constantly before me.
18654	23	49	17	‡Your children hurry back,‡while those who destroyed and devastated you depart.
18655	23	49	18	‡Look all around you! ‡All of them gather to you.‡As surely as I live,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡“you will certainly wear all of them like jewelry;‡you will put them on as if you were a bride.
18656	23	49	19	‡Yes, your land lies in ruins;‡it is desolate and devastated. ‡But now you will be too small to hold your residents,‡and those who devoured you will be far away.
18657	23	49	20	‡Yet the children born during your time of bereavement‡will say within your hearing,‡‘This place is too cramped for us, ‡make room for us so we can live here.’
18658	23	49	21	‡Then you will think to yourself, ‡‘Who bore these children for me?‡I was bereaved and barren,‡dismissed and divorced. ‡Who raised these children?‡Look, I was left all alone;‡where did these children come from?’”
18659	23	49	22	‡This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Look I will raise my hand to the nations;‡I will raise my signal flag to the peoples.‡They will bring your sons in their arms‡and carry your daughters on their shoulders.
18660	23	49	23	‡Kings will be your children’s guardians;‡their princesses will nurse your children. ‡With their faces to the ground they will bow down to you‡and they will lick the dirt on your feet.‡Then you will recognize that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡those who wait patiently for me are not put to shame.
18661	23	49	24	‡Can spoils be taken from a warrior,‡or captives be rescued from a conqueror?
18662	23	49	25	‡Indeed, ” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡“captives will be taken from a warrior;‡spoils will be rescued from a conqueror.‡I will oppose your adversary‡and I will rescue your children.
18663	23	49	26	‡I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh;‡they will get drunk on their own blood, as if it were wine. ‡Then all humankind will recognize that‡I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, your deliverer, ‡your protector, the Powerful One of Jacob.”
18664	23	50	1	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Where is your mother’s divorce certificate‡by which I divorced her?‡Or to which of my creditors did I sell you? ‡Look, you were sold because of your sins; ‡because of your rebellious acts I divorced your mother.
18665	23	50	2	‡Why does no one challenge me when I come?‡Why does no one respond when I call? ‡Is my hand too weak to deliver you?‡Do I lack the power to rescue you?‡Look, with a mere shout I can dry up the sea;‡I can turn streams into a desert,‡so the fish rot away and die ‡from lack of water.
18666	23	50	3	‡I can clothe the sky in darkness;‡I can cover it with sackcloth.”
18667	23	50	4	‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given me the capacity to be his spokesman, ‡so that I know how to help the weary. ‡He wakes me up every morning;‡he makes me alert so I can listen attentively as disciples do.
18668	23	50	5	‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken to me clearly; ‡I have not rebelled,‡I have not turned back.
18669	23	50	6	‡I offered my back to those who attacked, ‡my jaws to those who tore out my beard;‡I did not hide my face‡from insults and spitting.
18670	23	50	7	‡But the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> helps me,‡so I am not humiliated.‡For that reason I am steadfastly resolved; ‡I know I will not be put to shame.
18671	23	50	8	‡The one who vindicates me is close by.‡Who dares to argue with me? Let us confront each other! ‡Who is my accuser? Let him challenge me!
18672	23	50	9	‡Look, the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> helps me.‡Who dares to condemn me?‡Look, all of them will wear out like clothes;‡a moth will eat away at them.
18673	23	50	10	‡Who among you fears the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?‡Who obeys his servant?‡Whoever walks in deep darkness, ‡without light,‡should trust in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡and rely on his God.
18674	23	50	11	‡Look, all of you who start a fire‡and who equip yourselves with flaming arrows, ‡walk in the light of the fire you started‡and among the flaming arrows you ignited! ‡This is what you will receive from me: ‡you will lie down in a place of pain.
18675	23	51	1	‡“Listen to me, you who pursue godliness, ‡who seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!‡Look at the rock from which you were chiseled,‡at the quarry from which you were dug!
18676	23	51	2	‡Look at Abraham, your father,‡and Sarah, who gave you birth. ‡When I summoned him, he was a lone individual, ‡but I blessed him and gave him numerous descendants.
18677	23	51	3	‡Certainly the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will console Zion;‡he will console all her ruins.‡He will make her wilderness like Eden,‡her arid rift valley like the Garden of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‡Happiness and joy will be restored to her,‡thanksgiving and the sound of music.
18678	23	51	4	‡Pay attention to me, my people!‡Listen to me, my people!‡For I will issue a decree, ‡I will make my justice a light to the nations.
18679	23	51	5	‡I am ready to vindicate, ‡I am ready to deliver, ‡I will establish justice among the nations. ‡The coastlands wait patiently for me;‡they wait in anticipation for the revelation of my power.
18680	23	51	6	‡Look up at the sky!‡Look at the earth below!‡For the sky will dissipate like smoke,‡and the earth will wear out like clothes;‡its residents will die like gnats.‡But the deliverance I give is permanent;‡the vindication I provide will not disappear.
18681	23	51	7	‡Listen to me, you who know what is right,‡you people who are aware of my law! ‡Don’t be afraid of the insults of men;‡don’t be discouraged because of their abuse!
18682	23	51	8	‡For a moth will eat away at them like clothes;‡a clothes moth will devour them like wool.‡But the vindication I provide will be permanent;‡the deliverance I give will last.”
18683	23	51	9	‡Wake up! Wake up!‡Clothe yourself with strength, O arm of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! ‡Wake up as in former times, as in antiquity!‡Did you not smash the Proud One? ‡Did you not wound the sea monster?
18684	23	51	10	‡Did you not dry up the sea,‡the waters of the great deep?‡Did you not make a path through the depths of the sea,‡so those delivered from bondage could cross over?
18685	23	51	11	‡Those whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has ransomed will return;‡they will enter Zion with a happy shout.‡Unending joy will crown them, ‡happiness and joy will overwhelm them;‡grief and suffering will disappear.
18686	23	51	12	‡“I, I am the one who consoles you. ‡Why are you afraid of mortal men,‡of mere human beings who are as short-lived as grass?
18687	23	51	13	‡Why do you forget the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who made you,‡who stretched out the sky ‡and founded the earth?‡Why do you constantly tremble all day long ‡at the anger of the oppressor,‡when he makes plans to destroy?‡Where is the anger of the oppressor?
18688	23	51	14	‡The one who suffers will soon be released;‡he will not die in prison, ‡he will not go hungry.
18689	23	51	15	‡I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,‡who churns up the sea so that its waves surge.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies is his name!
18690	23	51	16	‡I commission you as my spokesman; ‡I cover you with the palm of my hand, ‡to establish the sky and to found the earth,‡to say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’”
18691	23	51	17	‡Wake up! Wake up!‡Get up, O Jerusalem!‡You drank from the cup the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> passed to you,‡which was full of his anger! ‡You drained dry‡the goblet full of intoxicating wine.
18692	23	51	18	‡There was no one to lead her‡among all the children she bore;‡there was no one to take her by the hand‡among all the children she raised.
18693	23	51	19	‡These double disasters confronted you.‡But who feels sorry for you?‡Destruction and devastation,‡famine and sword.‡But who consoles you?
18694	23	51	20	‡Your children faint;‡they lie at the head of every street‡like an antelope in a snare.‡They are left in a stupor by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anger,‡by the battle cry of your God.
18695	23	51	21	‡So listen to this, oppressed one,‡who is drunk, but not from wine!
18696	23	51	22	‡This is what your Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span>, even your God who judges his people says:‡“Look, I have removed from your hand‡the cup of intoxicating wine, ‡the goblet full of my anger. ‡You will no longer have to drink it.
18697	23	51	23	‡I will put it into the hand of your tormentors ‡who said to you, ‘Lie down, so we can walk over you.’‡You made your back like the ground,‡and like the street for those who walked over you.”‡
18698	23	52	1	‡Wake up! Wake up!‡Clothe yourself with strength, O Zion!‡Put on your beautiful clothes,‡O Jerusalem, holy city!‡For uncircumcised and unclean pagans‡will no longer invade you.
18699	23	52	2	‡Shake off the dirt! ‡Get up, captive Jerusalem! ‡Take off the iron chains around your neck,‡O captive daughter Zion!
18700	23	52	3	‡For this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“You were sold for nothing,‡and you will not be redeemed for money.”
18701	23	52	4	‡For this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“In the beginning my people went to live temporarily in Egypt;‡Assyria oppressed them for no good reason.
18702	23	52	5	‡And now, what do we have here?” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“Indeed my people have been carried away for nothing,‡those who rule over them taunt,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡“and my name is constantly slandered all day long.
18703	23	52	6	‡For this reason my people will know my name,‡for this reason they will know at that time that I am the one who says,‡‘Here I am.’”
18704	23	52	7	‡How delightful it is to see approaching over the mountains ‡the feet of a messenger who announces peace,‡a messenger who brings good news, who announces deliverance,‡who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”
18705	23	52	8	‡Listen, your watchmen shout;‡in unison they shout for joy,‡for they see with their very own eyes ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s return to Zion.
18706	23	52	9	‡In unison give a joyful shout,‡O ruins of Jerusalem!‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> consoles his people;‡he protects Jerusalem.
18707	23	52	10	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> reveals his royal power ‡in the sight of all the nations;‡the entire earth sees‡our God deliver.
18708	23	52	11	‡Leave! Leave! Get out of there!‡Don’t touch anything unclean!‡Get out of it! ‡Stay pure, you who carry the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s holy items!
18709	23	52	12	‡Yet do not depart quickly‡or leave in a panic. ‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> goes before you;‡the God of Israel is your rear guard.‡
18710	23	52	13	‡“Look, my servant will succeed! ‡He will be elevated, lifted high, and greatly exalted –
18711	23	52	14	‡(just as many were horrified by the sight of you) ‡he was so disfigured he no longer looked like a man; ‡his form was so marred he no longer looked human –
18712	23	52	15	‡so now he will startle many nations.‡Kings will be shocked by his exaltation, ‡for they will witness something unannounced to them,‡and they will understand something they had not heard about.
18713	23	53	1	‡Who would have believed what we just heard? ‡When was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s power revealed through him?
18714	23	53	2	‡He sprouted up like a twig before God, ‡like a root out of parched soil; ‡he had no stately form or majesty that might catch our attention, ‡no special appearance that we should want to follow him.
18715	23	53	3	‡He was despised and rejected by people, ‡one who experienced pain and was acquainted with illness;‡people hid their faces from him; ‡he was despised, and we considered him insignificant.
18716	23	53	4	‡But he lifted up our illnesses,‡he carried our pain; ‡even though we thought he was being punished,‡attacked by God, and afflicted for something he had done.
18717	23	53	5	‡He was wounded because of our rebellious deeds,‡crushed because of our sins;‡he endured punishment that made us well; ‡because of his wounds we have been healed.
18718	23	53	6	‡All of us had wandered off like sheep;‡each of us had strayed off on his own path,‡but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> caused the sin of all of us to attack him.
18719	23	53	7	‡He was treated harshly and afflicted, ‡but he did not even open his mouth.‡Like a lamb led to the slaughtering block,‡like a sheep silent before her shearers,‡he did not even open his mouth.
18720	23	53	8	‡He was led away after an unjust trial – ‡but who even cared? ‡Indeed, he was cut off from the land of the living; ‡because of the rebellion of his own people he was wounded.
18721	23	53	9	‡They intended to bury him with criminals, ‡but he ended up in a rich man’s tomb, ‡because he had committed no violent deeds,‡nor had he spoken deceitfully.
18722	23	53	10	‡Though the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> desired to crush him and make him ill,‡once restitution is made, ‡he will see descendants and enjoy long life, ‡and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s purpose will be accomplished through him.
18723	23	53	11	‡Having suffered, he will reflect on his work,‡he will be satisfied when he understands what he has done. ‡“My servant will acquit many, ‡for he carried their sins.
18724	23	53	12	‡So I will assign him a portion with the multitudes, ‡he will divide the spoils of victory with the powerful, ‡because he willingly submitted to death‡and was numbered with the rebels,‡when he lifted up the sin of many‡and intervened on behalf of the rebels.”
18725	23	54	1	‡“Shout for joy, O barren one who has not given birth!‡Give a joyful shout and cry out, you who have not been in labor!‡For the children of the desolate one are more numerous‡than the children of the married woman,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18726	23	54	2	‡Make your tent larger,‡stretch your tent curtains farther out! ‡Spare no effort,‡lengthen your ropes,‡and pound your stakes deep.
18727	23	54	3	‡For you will spread out to the right and to the left;‡your children will conquer nations‡and will resettle desolate cities.
18728	23	54	4	‡Don’t be afraid, for you will not be put to shame!‡Don’t be intimidated, for you will not be humiliated!‡You will forget about the shame you experienced in your youth;‡you will no longer remember the disgrace of your abandonment.
18729	23	54	5	‡For your husband is the one who made you – ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies is his name.‡He is your protector, the Holy One of Israel. ‡He is called “God of the entire earth.”
18730	23	54	6	‡“Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will call you back‡like a wife who has been abandoned and suffers from depression, ‡like a young wife when she has been rejected,” says your God.
18731	23	54	7	‡“For a short time I abandoned you,‡but with great compassion I will gather you.
18732	23	54	8	‡In a burst of anger I rejected you momentarily,‡but with lasting devotion I will have compassion on you,”‡says your protector, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18733	23	54	9	‡“As far as I am concerned, this is like in Noah’s time, ‡when I vowed that the waters of Noah’s flood would never again cover the earth.‡In the same way I have vowed that I will not be angry at you or shout at you.
18734	23	54	10	‡Even if the mountains are removed‡and the hills displaced,‡my devotion will not be removed from you,‡nor will my covenant of friendship be displaced,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the one who has compassion on you.
18735	23	54	11	‡“O afflicted one, driven away, and unconsoled!‡Look, I am about to set your stones in antimony‡and I lay your foundation with lapis lazuli.
18736	23	54	12	‡I will make your pinnacles out of gems, ‡your gates out of beryl, ‡and your outer wall out of beautiful stones.
18737	23	54	13	‡All your children will be followers of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡and your children will enjoy great prosperity.
18738	23	54	14	‡You will be reestablished when I vindicate you. ‡You will not experience oppression; ‡indeed, you will not be afraid.‡You will not be terrified, ‡for nothing frightening will come near you.
18739	23	54	15	‡If anyone dares to challenge you, it will not be my doing!‡Whoever tries to challenge you will be defeated.
18740	23	54	16	‡Look, I create the craftsman,‡who fans the coals into a fire‡and forges a weapon. ‡I create the destroyer so he might devastate.
18741	23	54	17	‡No weapon forged to be used against you will succeed;‡you will refute everyone who tries to accuse you. ‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will do for his servants – ‡I will vindicate them,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18742	23	55	1	‡“Hey, all who are thirsty, come to the water!‡You who have no money, come! ‡Buy and eat!‡Come! Buy wine and milk‡without money and without cost!
18743	23	55	2	‡Why pay money for something that will not nourish you? ‡Why spend your hard-earned money on something that will not satisfy?‡Listen carefully to me and eat what is nourishing! ‡Enjoy fine food!
18744	23	55	3	‡Pay attention and come to me!‡Listen, so you can live! ‡Then I will make an unconditional covenantal promise to you,‡just like the reliable covenantal promises I made to David.
18745	23	55	4	‡Look, I made him a witness to nations, ‡a ruler and commander of nations.”
18746	23	55	5	‡Look, you will summon nations you did not previously know;‡nations that did not previously know you will run to you,‡because of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,‡the Holy One of Israel, ‡for he bestows honor on you.
18747	23	55	6	‡Seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> while he makes himself available; ‡call to him while he is nearby!
18748	23	55	7	‡The wicked need to abandon their lifestyle ‡and sinful people their plans. ‡They should return to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and he will show mercy to them, ‡and to their God, for he will freely forgive them.
18749	23	55	8	‡“Indeed, my plans are not like your plans,‡and my deeds are not like your deeds,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
18750	23	55	9	‡“for just as the sky is higher than the earth,‡so my deeds are superior to your deeds‡and my plans superior to your plans.
18751	23	55	10	‡The rain and snow fall from the sky‡and do not return,‡but instead water the earth‡and make it produce and yield crops,‡and provide seed for the planter and food for those who must eat.
18752	23	55	11	‡In the same way, the promise that I make‡does not return to me, having accomplished nothing. ‡No, it is realized as I desire‡and is fulfilled as I intend.”
18753	23	55	12	‡Indeed you will go out with joy;‡you will be led along in peace;‡the mountains and hills will give a joyful shout before you,‡and all the trees in the field will clap their hands.
18754	23	55	13	‡Evergreens will grow in place of thorn bushes,‡firs will grow in place of nettles;‡they will be a monument to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡a permanent reminder that will remain.
18755	23	56	1	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“Promote justice! Do what is right!‡For I am ready to deliver you;‡I am ready to vindicate you openly.
18756	23	56	2	‡The people who do this will be blessed, ‡the people who commit themselves to obedience, ‡who observe the Sabbath and do not defile it,‡who refrain from doing anything that is wrong.
18757	23	56	3	‡No foreigner who becomes a follower of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> should say,‡‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will certainly exclude me from his people.’‡The eunuch should not say,‡‘Look, I am like a dried-up tree.’”
18758	23	56	4	‡For this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“For the eunuchs who observe my Sabbaths‡and choose what pleases me‡and are faithful to my covenant,
18759	23	56	5	‡I will set up within my temple and my walls a monument ‡that will be better than sons and daughters.‡I will set up a permanent monument for them that will remain.
18760	23	56	6	‡As for foreigners who become followers of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and serve him,‡who love the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and want to be his servants – ‡all who observe the Sabbath and do not defile it,‡and who are faithful to my covenant –
18761	23	56	7	‡I will bring them to my holy mountain;‡I will make them happy in the temple where people pray to me. ‡Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar,‡for my temple will be known as a temple where all nations may pray.”
18762	23	56	8	‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says this,‡the one who gathers the dispersed of Israel:‡“I will still gather them up.”
18763	23	56	9	‡All you wild animals in the fields, come and devour,‡all you wild animals in the forest!
18764	23	56	10	‡All their watchmen are blind,‡they are unaware. ‡All of them are like mute dogs,‡unable to bark.‡They pant, lie down,‡and love to snooze.
18765	23	56	11	‡The dogs have big appetites;‡they are never full. ‡They are shepherds who have no understanding;‡they all go their own way,‡each one looking for monetary gain.
18766	23	56	12	‡Each one says, ‡‘Come on, I’ll get some wine!‡Let’s guzzle some beer!‡Tomorrow will be just like today!‡We’ll have everything we want!’
18767	23	57	1	‡The godly perish,‡but no one cares. ‡Honest people disappear, ‡when no one minds ‡that the godly disappear because of evil.
18768	23	57	2	‡Those who live uprightly enter a place of peace;‡they rest on their beds.
18769	23	57	3	‡But approach, you sons of omen readers,‡you offspring of adulteresses and prostitutes!
18770	23	57	4	‡At whom are you laughing?‡At whom are you opening your mouth‡and sticking out your tongue?‡You are the children of rebels,‡the offspring of liars,
18771	23	57	5	‡you who inflame your lusts among the oaks and under every green tree,‡who slaughter children near the streams under the rocky overhangs.
18772	23	57	6	‡Among the smooth stones of the stream are the idols you love;‡they, they are the object of your devotion. ‡You pour out liquid offerings to them,‡you make an offering.‡Because of these things how can I relent from judgment?
18773	23	57	7	‡On every high, elevated hill you prepare your bed;‡you go up there to offer sacrifices.
18774	23	57	8	‡Behind the door and doorpost you put your symbols. ‡Indeed, you depart from me and go up‡and invite them into bed with you. ‡You purchase favors from them, ‡you love their bed,‡and gaze longingly on their naked bodies.
18775	23	57	9	‡You take olive oil as tribute to your king, ‡along with many perfumes. ‡You send your messengers to a distant place;‡you go all the way to Sheol.
18776	23	57	10	‡Because of the long distance you must travel, you get tired, ‡but you do not say, ‘I give up.’ ‡You get renewed energy, ‡so you don’t collapse.
18777	23	57	11	‡Whom are you worried about?‡Whom do you fear, that you would act so deceitfully‡and not remember me‡or think about me? ‡Because I have been silent for so long, ‡you are not afraid of me.
18778	23	57	12	‡I will denounce your so-called righteousness and your deeds, ‡but they will not help you.
18779	23	57	13	‡When you cry out for help, let your idols help you!‡The wind blows them all away, ‡a breeze carries them away. ‡But the one who looks to me for help will inherit the land‡and will have access to my holy mountain.”
18780	23	57	14	‡He says, ‡“Build it! Build it! Clear a way!‡Remove all the obstacles out of the way of my people!”
18781	23	57	15	‡For this is what the high and exalted one says,‡the one who rules forever, whose name is holy:‡“I dwell in an exalted and holy place,‡but also with the discouraged and humiliated, ‡in order to cheer up the humiliated‡and to encourage the discouraged.
18782	23	57	16	‡For I will not be hostile forever‡or perpetually angry,‡for then man’s spirit would grow faint before me, ‡the life-giving breath I created.
18783	23	57	17	‡I was angry because of their sinful greed;‡I attacked them and angrily rejected them, ‡yet they remained disobedient and stubborn.
18784	23	57	18	‡I have seen their behavior, ‡but I will heal them. I will lead them,‡and I will provide comfort to them and those who mourn with them.
18785	23	57	19	‡I am the one who gives them reason to celebrate. ‡Complete prosperity is available both to those who are far away and those who are nearby,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “and I will heal them.
18786	23	57	20	‡But the wicked are like a surging sea‡that is unable to be quiet;‡its waves toss up mud and sand.
18787	23	57	21	‡There will be no prosperity,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
18788	23	58	1	‡“Shout loudly! Don’t be quiet!‡Yell as loud as a trumpet!‡Confront my people with their rebellious deeds; ‡confront Jacob’s family with their sin!
18789	23	58	2	‡They seek me day after day;‡they want to know my requirements, ‡like a nation that does what is right‡and does not reject the law of their God.‡They ask me for just decrees;‡they want to be near God.
18790	23	58	3	‡They lament, ‘Why don’t you notice when we fast?‡Why don’t you pay attention when we humble ourselves?’‡Look, at the same time you fast, you satisfy your selfish desires, ‡you oppress your workers.
18791	23	58	4	‡Look, your fasting is accompanied by arguments, brawls,‡and fistfights. ‡Do not fast as you do today,‡trying to make your voice heard in heaven.
18792	23	58	5	‡Is this really the kind of fasting I want? ‡Do I want a day when people merely humble themselves, ‡bowing their heads like a reed‡and stretching out on sackcloth and ashes?‡Is this really what you call a fast,‡a day that is pleasing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?
18793	23	58	6	‡No, this is the kind of fast I want. ‡I want you to remove the sinful chains,‡to tear away the ropes of the burdensome yoke,‡to set free the oppressed, ‡and to break every burdensome yoke.
18794	23	58	7	‡I want you to share your food with the hungry‡and to provide shelter for homeless, oppressed people. ‡When you see someone naked, clothe him!‡Don’t turn your back on your own flesh and blood!
18795	23	58	8	‡Then your light will shine like the sunrise; ‡your restoration will quickly arrive; ‡your godly behavior will go before you,‡and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s splendor will be your rear guard.
18796	23	58	9	‡Then you will call out, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will respond;‡you will cry out, and he will reply, ‘Here I am.’‡You must remove the burdensome yoke from among you‡and stop pointing fingers and speaking sinfully.
18797	23	58	10	‡You must actively help the hungry‡and feed the oppressed. ‡Then your light will dispel the darkness, ‡and your darkness will be transformed into noonday.
18798	23	58	11	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will continually lead you;‡he will feed you even in parched regions. ‡He will give you renewed strength, ‡and you will be like a well-watered garden,‡like a spring that continually produces water.
18799	23	58	12	‡Your perpetual ruins will be rebuilt; ‡you will reestablish the ancient foundations.‡You will be called, ‘The one who repairs broken walls,‡the one who makes the streets inhabitable again.’
18800	23	58	13	‡You must observe the Sabbath ‡rather than doing anything you please on my holy day. ‡You must look forward to the Sabbath ‡and treat the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s holy day with respect. ‡You must treat it with respect by refraining from your normal activities,‡and by refraining from your selfish pursuits and from making business deals.
18801	23	58	14	‡Then you will find joy in your relationship to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡and I will give you great prosperity, ‡and cause crops to grow on the land I gave to your ancestor Jacob.” ‡Know for certain that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken.
18802	23	59	1	‡Look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s hand is not too weak to deliver you;‡his ear is not too deaf to hear you.
18803	23	59	2	‡But your sinful acts have alienated you from your God;‡your sins have caused him to reject you and not listen to your prayers.
18804	23	59	3	‡For your hands are stained with blood‡and your fingers with sin;‡your lips speak lies,‡your tongue utters malicious words.
18805	23	59	4	‡No one is concerned about justice; ‡no one sets forth his case truthfully.‡They depend on false words and tell lies;‡they conceive of oppression ‡and give birth to sin.
18806	23	59	5	‡They hatch the eggs of a poisonous snake‡and spin a spider’s web.‡Whoever eats their eggs will die,‡a poisonous snake is hatched.
18807	23	59	6	‡Their webs cannot be used for clothing;‡they cannot cover themselves with what they make.‡Their deeds are sinful;‡they commit violent crimes.
18808	23	59	7	‡They are eager to do evil, ‡quick to shed innocent blood. ‡Their thoughts are sinful;‡they crush and destroy.
18809	23	59	8	‡They are unfamiliar with peace;‡their deeds are unjust. ‡They use deceitful methods,‡and whoever deals with them is unfamiliar with peace.
18810	23	59	9	‡For this reason deliverance is far from us ‡and salvation does not reach us.‡We wait for light, but see only darkness; ‡we wait for a bright light, but live in deep darkness.
18811	23	59	10	‡We grope along the wall like the blind,‡we grope like those who cannot see; ‡we stumble at noontime as if it were evening.‡Though others are strong, we are like dead men.
18812	23	59	11	‡We all growl like bears,‡we coo mournfully like doves;‡we wait for deliverance, but there is none,‡for salvation, but it is far from us.
18813	23	59	12	‡For you are aware of our many rebellious deeds, ‡and our sins testify against us;‡indeed, we are aware of our rebellious deeds;‡we know our sins all too well.
18814	23	59	13	‡We have rebelled and tried to deceive the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡we turned back from following our God.‡We stir up oppression and rebellion;‡we tell lies we concocted in our minds.
18815	23	59	14	‡Justice is driven back;‡godliness stands far off.‡Indeed, honesty stumbles in the city square‡and morality is not even able to enter.
18816	23	59	15	‡Honesty has disappeared;‡the one who tries to avoid evil is robbed.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> watches and is displeased, ‡for there is no justice.
18817	23	59	16	‡He sees there is no advocate; ‡he is shocked that no one intervenes.‡So he takes matters into his own hands; ‡his desire for justice drives him on.
18818	23	59	17	‡He wears his desire for justice like body armor, ‡and his desire to deliver is like a helmet on his head. ‡He puts on the garments of vengeance ‡and wears zeal like a robe.
18819	23	59	18	‡He repays them for what they have done,‡dispensing angry judgment to his adversaries‡and punishing his enemies. ‡He repays the coastlands.
18820	23	59	19	‡In the west, people respect the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s reputation; ‡in the east they recognize his splendor. ‡For he comes like a rushing stream‡driven on by wind sent from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18821	23	59	20	‡“A protector comes to Zion,‡to those in Jacob who repent of their rebellious deeds,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18822	23	59	21	¶“As for me, this is my promise to them,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. “My Spirit, who is upon you, and my words, which I have placed in your mouth, will not depart from your mouth or from the mouths of your children and descendants from this time forward,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18823	23	60	1	‡“Arise! Shine! For your light arrives!‡The splendor of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> shines on you!
18824	23	60	2	‡For, look, darkness covers the earth‡and deep darkness covers the nations,‡but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> shines on you;‡his splendor appears over you.
18825	23	60	3	‡Nations come to your light,‡kings to your bright light.
18826	23	60	4	‡Look all around you! ‡They all gather and come to you – ‡your sons come from far away‡and your daughters are escorted by guardians.
18827	23	60	5	‡Then you will look and smile, ‡you will be excited and your heart will swell with pride. ‡For the riches of distant lands will belong to you‡and the wealth of nations will come to you.
18828	23	60	6	‡Camel caravans will cover your roads, ‡young camels from Midian and Ephah.‡All the merchants of Sheba will come,‡bringing gold and incense‡and singing praises to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18829	23	60	7	‡All the sheep of Kedar will be gathered to you;‡the rams of Nebaioth will be available to you as sacrifices. ‡They will go up on my altar acceptably, ‡and I will bestow honor on my majestic temple.
18830	23	60	8	‡Who are these who float along like a cloud,‡who fly like doves to their shelters?
18831	23	60	9	‡Indeed, the coastlands look eagerly for me,‡the large ships are in the lead,‡bringing your sons from far away,‡along with their silver and gold,‡to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, ‡the Holy One of Israel, for he has bestowed honor on you.
18832	23	60	10	‡Foreigners will rebuild your walls;‡their kings will serve you.‡Even though I struck you down in my anger,‡I will restore my favor and have compassion on you.
18833	23	60	11	‡Your gates will remain open at all times;‡they will not be shut during the day or at night,‡so that the wealth of nations may be delivered,‡with their kings leading the way.
18834	23	60	12	‡Indeed, nations or kingdoms that do not serve you will perish;‡such nations will definitely be destroyed.
18835	23	60	13	‡The splendor of Lebanon will come to you, ‡its evergreens, firs, and cypresses together,‡to beautify my palace; ‡I will bestow honor on my throne room.
18836	23	60	14	‡The children of your oppressors will come bowing to you;‡all who treated you with disrespect will bow down at your feet.‡They will call you, ‘The City of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡Zion of the Holy One of Israel.’
18837	23	60	15	‡You were once abandoned ‡and despised, with no one passing through,‡but I will make you a permanent source of pride‡and joy to coming generations.
18838	23	60	16	‡You will drink the milk of nations;‡you will nurse at the breasts of kings. ‡Then you will recognize that I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, am your deliverer,‡your protector, the Powerful One of Jacob.
18839	23	60	17	‡Instead of bronze, I will bring you gold,‡instead of iron, I will bring you silver,‡instead of wood, I will bring you bronze,‡instead of stones, I will bring you iron.‡I will make prosperity your overseer,‡and vindication your sovereign ruler.
18840	23	60	18	‡Sounds of violence will no longer be heard in your land,‡or the sounds of destruction and devastation within your borders.‡You will name your walls, ‘Deliverance,’‡and your gates, ‘Praise.’
18841	23	60	19	‡The sun will no longer supply light for you by day,‡nor will the moon’s brightness shine on you;‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be your permanent source of light – ‡the splendor of your God will shine upon you.
18842	23	60	20	‡Your sun will no longer set;‡your moon will not disappear; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be your permanent source of light;‡your time of sorrow will be over.
18843	23	60	21	‡All of your people will be godly; ‡they will possess the land permanently.‡I will plant them like a shoot;‡they will be the product of my labor,‡through whom I reveal my splendor.
18844	23	60	22	‡The least of you will multiply into a thousand;‡the smallest of you will become a large nation.‡When the right time comes, I the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will quickly do this!”
18845	23	61	1	‡The Spirit of the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is upon me,‡because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has chosen me. ‡He has commissioned me to encourage the poor,‡to help the brokenhearted,‡to decree the release of captives,‡and the freeing of prisoners,
18846	23	61	2	‡to announce the year when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will show his favor,‡the day when our God will seek vengeance, ‡to console all who mourn,
18847	23	61	3	‡to strengthen those who mourn in Zion,‡by giving them a turban, instead of ashes,‡oil symbolizing joy, instead of mourning,‡a garment symbolizing praise, instead of discouragement. ‡They will be called oaks of righteousness, ‡trees planted by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to reveal his splendor.
18848	23	61	4	‡They will rebuild the perpetual ruins‡and restore the places that were desolate; ‡they will reestablish the ruined cities,‡the places that have been desolate since ancient times.
18849	23	61	5	‡“Foreigners will take care of your sheep;‡foreigners will work in your fields and vineyards.
18850	23	61	6	‡You will be called, ‘the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s priests,‡servants of our God.’ ‡You will enjoy the wealth of nations‡and boast about the riches you receive from them.
18851	23	61	7	‡Instead of shame, you will get a double portion; ‡instead of humiliation, they will rejoice over the land they receive. ‡Yes, they will possess a double portion in their land‡and experience lasting joy.
18852	23	61	8	‡For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, love justice‡and hate robbery and sin.‡I will repay them because of my faithfulness; ‡I will make a permanent covenant with them.
18853	23	61	9	‡Their descendants will be known among the nations,‡their offspring among the peoples.‡All who see them will recognize that‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has blessed them.”
18854	23	61	10	‡I will greatly rejoice in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡I will be overjoyed because of my God. ‡For he clothes me in garments of deliverance;‡he puts on me a robe symbolizing vindication. ‡I look like a bridegroom when he wears a turban as a priest would;‡I look like a bride when she puts on her jewelry.
18855	23	61	11	‡For just as the ground produces its crops‡and a garden yields its produce,‡so the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will cause deliverance to grow,‡and give his people reason to praise him in the sight of all the nations.
18856	23	62	1	‡“For the sake of Zion I will not be silent;‡for the sake of Jerusalem I will not be quiet,‡until her vindication shines brightly ‡and her deliverance burns like a torch.”
18857	23	62	2	‡Nations will see your vindication,‡and all kings your splendor.‡You will be called by a new name‡that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> himself will give you.
18858	23	62	3	‡You will be a majestic crown in the hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡a royal turban in the hand of your God.
18859	23	62	4	‡You will no longer be called, “Abandoned,”‡and your land will no longer be called “Desolate.”‡Indeed, you will be called “My Delight is in Her,” ‡and your land “Married.” ‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will take delight in you,‡and your land will be married to him.
18860	23	62	5	‡As a young man marries a young woman,‡so your sons will marry you.‡As a bridegroom rejoices over a bride,‡so your God will rejoice over you.
18861	23	62	6	‡I post watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem;‡they should keep praying all day and all night. ‡You who pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, don’t be silent!
18862	23	62	7	‡Don’t allow him to rest until he reestablishes Jerusalem, ‡until he makes Jerusalem the pride of the earth.
18863	23	62	8	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> swears an oath by his right hand,‡by his strong arm: ‡“I will never again give your grain ‡to your enemies as food,‡and foreigners will not drink your wine,‡which you worked hard to produce.‡
18864	23	62	9	‡But those who harvest the grain will eat it,‡and will praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡Those who pick the grapes will drink the wine ‡in the courts of my holy sanctuary.”
18865	23	62	10	‡Come through! Come through the gates!‡Prepare the way for the people!‡Build it! Build the roadway!‡Remove the stones!‡Lift a signal flag for the nations!
18866	23	62	11	‡Look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> announces to the entire earth: ‡“Say to Daughter Zion,‡‘Look, your deliverer comes!‡Look, his reward is with him‡and his reward goes before him!’”
18867	23	62	12	‡They will be called, “The Holy People,‡the Ones Protected by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”‡You will be called, “Sought After,‡City Not Abandoned.”
18868	23	63	1	‡Who is this who comes from Edom, ‡dressed in bright red, coming from Bozrah? ‡Who is this one wearing royal attire, ‡who marches confidently because of his great strength?‡“It is I, the one who announces vindication,‡and who is able to deliver!”
18869	23	63	2	‡Why are your clothes red?‡Why do you look like someone who has stomped on grapes in a vat?
18870	23	63	3	‡“I have stomped grapes in the winepress all by myself;‡no one from the nations joined me.‡I stomped on them in my anger;‡I trampled them down in my rage.‡Their juice splashed on my garments,‡and stained all my clothes.
18871	23	63	4	‡For I looked forward to the day of vengeance,‡and then payback time arrived.
18872	23	63	5	‡I looked, but there was no one to help;‡I was shocked because there was no one offering support. ‡So my right arm accomplished deliverance;‡my raging anger drove me on.
18873	23	63	6	‡I trampled nations in my anger,‡I made them drunk in my rage,‡I splashed their blood on the ground.”
18874	23	63	7	‡I will tell of the faithful acts of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s praiseworthy deeds.‡I will tell about all the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did for us,‡the many good things he did for the family of Israel, ‡because of his compassion and great faithfulness.
18875	23	63	8	‡He said, “Certainly they will be my people,‡children who are not disloyal.” ‡He became their deliverer.
18876	23	63	9	‡Through all that they suffered, he suffered too. ‡The messenger sent from his very presence delivered them.‡In his love and mercy he protected them;‡he lifted them up and carried them throughout ancient times.
18877	23	63	10	‡But they rebelled and offended his holy Spirit, ‡so he turned into an enemy‡and fought against them.
18878	23	63	11	‡His people remembered the ancient times. ‡Where is the one who brought them up out of the sea,‡along with the shepherd of his flock?‡Where is the one who placed his holy Spirit among them,
18879	23	63	12	‡the one who made his majestic power available to Moses, ‡who divided the water before them,‡gaining for himself a lasting reputation,
18880	23	63	13	‡who led them through the deep water?‡Like a horse running through the wilderness they did not stumble.
18881	23	63	14	‡Like an animal that goes down into a valley to graze, ‡so the Spirit of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> granted them rest.‡In this way you guided your people,‡gaining for yourself an honored reputation.
18882	23	63	15	‡Look down from heaven and take notice,‡from your holy, majestic palace!‡Where are your zeal and power?‡Do not hold back your tender compassion!
18883	23	63	16	‡For you are our father,‡though Abraham does not know us‡and Israel does not recognize us.‡You, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, are our father;‡you have been called our protector from ancient times.
18884	23	63	17	‡Why, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, do you make us stray from your ways, ‡and make our minds stubborn so that we do not obey you? ‡Return for the sake of your servants,‡the tribes of your inheritance!
18885	23	63	18	‡For a short time your special nation possessed a land, ‡but then our adversaries knocked down your holy sanctuary.
18886	23	63	19	We existed from ancient times, ‡but you did not rule over them;‡they were not your subjects.
18887	23	64	1	‡(63:19b ) If only you would tear apart the sky and come down!‡The mountains would tremble before you!
18888	23	64	2	‡(64:1) As when fire ignites dry wood,‡or fire makes water boil,‡let your adversaries know who you are, ‡and may the nations shake at your presence!
18889	23	64	3	‡When you performed awesome deeds that took us by surprise, ‡you came down, and the mountains trembled before you.
18890	23	64	4	‡Since ancient times no one has heard or perceived, ‡no eye has seen any God besides you,‡who intervenes for those who wait for him.
18891	23	64	5	‡You assist those who delight in doing what is right, ‡who observe your commandments. ‡Look, you were angry because we violated them continually. ‡How then can we be saved?
18892	23	64	6	‡We are all like one who is unclean,‡all our so-called righteous acts are like a menstrual rag in your sight. ‡We all wither like a leaf;‡our sins carry us away like the wind.
18893	23	64	7	‡No one invokes your name,‡or makes an effort to take hold of you. ‡For you have rejected us ‡and handed us over to our own sins.
18894	23	64	8	‡Yet, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you are our father.‡We are the clay, and you are our potter;‡we are all the product of your labor.
18895	23	64	9	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, do not be too angry!‡Do not hold our sins against us continually! ‡Take a good look at your people, at all of us!
18896	23	64	10	‡Your chosen cities have become a wilderness;‡Zion has become a wilderness,‡Jerusalem, a desolate ruin.
18897	23	64	11	‡Our holy temple, our pride and joy, ‡the place where our ancestors praised you,‡has been burned with fire;‡all our prized possessions have been destroyed.
18898	23	64	12	‡In light of all this, how can you still hold back, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?‡How can you be silent and continue to humiliate us?
18899	23	65	1	‡“I made myself available to those who did not ask for me; ‡I appeared to those who did not look for me. ‡I said, ‘Here I am! Here I am!’‡to a nation that did not invoke my name.
18900	23	65	2	‡I spread out my hands all day long‡to my rebellious people,‡who lived in a way that is morally unacceptable,‡and who did what they desired.
18901	23	65	3	‡These people continually and blatantly offend me ‡as they sacrifice in their sacred orchards ‡and burn incense on brick altars.
18902	23	65	4	‡They sit among the tombs ‡and keep watch all night long. ‡They eat pork, ‡and broth from unclean sacrificial meat is in their pans.
18903	23	65	5	‡They say, ‘Keep to yourself!‡Don’t get near me, for I am holier than you!’‡These people are like smoke in my nostrils,‡like a fire that keeps burning all day long.
18904	23	65	6	‡Look, I have decreed: ‡I will not keep silent, but will pay them back;‡I will pay them back exactly what they deserve,
18905	23	65	7	‡for your sins and your ancestors’ sins,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“Because they burned incense on the mountains‡and offended me on the hills,‡I will punish them in full measure.”
18906	23	65	8	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“When juice is discovered in a cluster of grapes,‡someone says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for it contains juice.’ ‡So I will do for the sake of my servants – ‡I will not destroy everyone.
18907	23	65	9	‡I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,‡and from Judah people to take possession of my mountains.‡My chosen ones will take possession of the land; ‡my servants will live there.
18908	23	65	10	‡Sharon will become a pasture for sheep,‡and the Valley of Achor a place where cattle graze; ‡they will belong to my people, who seek me.
18909	23	65	11	‡But as for you who abandon the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡and forget about worshiping at my holy mountain,‡who prepare a feast for the god called ‘Fortune,’ ‡and fill up wine jugs for the god called ‘Destiny’ –
18910	23	65	12	‡I predestine you to die by the sword, ‡all of you will kneel down at the slaughtering block, ‡because I called to you, and you did not respond,‡I spoke and you did not listen.‡You did evil before me; ‡you chose to do what displeases me.”
18911	23	65	13	‡So this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Look, my servants will eat, but you will be hungry!‡Look, my servants will drink, but you will be thirsty!‡Look, my servants will rejoice, but you will be humiliated!
18912	23	65	14	‡Look, my servants will shout for joy as happiness fills their hearts! ‡But you will cry out as sorrow fills your hearts; ‡you will wail because your spirits will be crushed.
18913	23	65	15	‡Your names will live on in the curse formulas of my chosen ones. ‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will kill you,‡but he will give his servants another name.
18914	23	65	16	‡Whoever pronounces a blessing in the earth ‡will do so in the name of the faithful God; ‡whoever makes an oath in the earth‡will do so in the name of the faithful God. ‡For past problems will be forgotten;‡I will no longer think about them.
18915	23	65	17	‡For look, I am ready to create ‡new heavens and a new earth! ‡The former ones will not be remembered;‡no one will think about them anymore.
18916	23	65	18	‡But be happy and rejoice forevermore‡over what I am about to create!‡For look, I am ready to create Jerusalem to be a source of joy, ‡and her people to be a source of happiness.
18917	23	65	19	‡Jerusalem will bring me joy,‡and my people will bring me happiness. ‡The sound of weeping or cries of sorrow‡will never be heard in her again.
18918	23	65	20	‡Never again will one of her infants live just a few days ‡or an old man die before his time. ‡Indeed, no one will die before the age of a hundred, ‡anyone who fails to reach the age of a hundred will be considered cursed.
18919	23	65	21	‡They will build houses and live in them;‡they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
18920	23	65	22	‡No longer will they build a house only to have another live in it, ‡or plant a vineyard only to have another eat its fruit, ‡for my people will live as long as trees, ‡and my chosen ones will enjoy to the fullest what they have produced.
18921	23	65	23	‡They will not work in vain,‡or give birth to children that will experience disaster. ‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will bless their children‡and their descendants.
18922	23	65	24	‡Before they even call out, I will respond;‡while they are still speaking, I will hear.
18923	23	65	25	‡A wolf and a lamb will graze together; ‡a lion, like an ox, will eat straw, ‡and a snake’s food will be dirt. ‡They will no longer injure or destroy‡on my entire royal mountain,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18924	23	66	1	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“The heavens are my throne‡and the earth is my footstool.‡Where then is the house you will build for me?‡Where is the place where I will rest?
18925	23	66	2	‡My hand made them; ‡that is how they came to be,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡I show special favor to the humble and contrite,‡who respect what I have to say.
18926	23	66	3	‡The one who slaughters a bull also strikes down a man; ‡the one who sacrifices a lamb also breaks a dog’s neck; ‡the one who presents an offering includes pig’s blood with it; ‡the one who offers incense also praises an idol. ‡They have decided to behave this way; ‡they enjoy these disgusting practices.
18927	23	66	4	‡So I will choose severe punishment for them;‡I will bring on them what they dread,‡because I called, and no one responded,‡I spoke and they did not listen.‡They did evil before me; ‡they chose to do what displeases me.”
18928	23	66	5	‡Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message,‡you who respect his word! ‡Your countrymen, who hate you ‡and exclude you, supposedly for the sake of my name,‡say, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> be glorified,‡then we will witness your joy.” ‡But they will be put to shame.
18929	23	66	6	‡The sound of battle comes from the city;‡the sound comes from the temple!‡It is the sound of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> paying back his enemies.
18930	23	66	7	‡Before she goes into labor, she gives birth!‡Before her contractions begin, she delivers a boy!
18931	23	66	8	‡Who has ever heard of such a thing?‡Who has ever seen this?‡Can a country be brought forth in one day?‡Can a nation be born in a single moment?‡Yet as soon as Zion goes into labor she gives birth to sons!
18932	23	66	9	‡“Do I bring a baby to the birth opening and then not deliver it?”‡asks the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“Or do I bring a baby to the point of delivery and then hold it back?”‡asks your God.
18933	23	66	10	‡Be happy for Jerusalem‡and rejoice with her, all you who love her!‡Share in her great joy,‡all you who have mourned over her!
18934	23	66	11	‡For you will nurse from her satisfying breasts and be nourished; ‡you will feed with joy from her milk-filled breasts.
18935	23	66	12	‡For this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Look, I am ready to extend to her prosperity that will flow like a river,‡the riches of nations will flow into her like a stream that floods its banks. ‡You will nurse from her breast and be carried at her side;‡you will play on her knees.
18936	23	66	13	‡As a mother consoles a child, ‡so I will console you,‡and you will be consoled over Jerusalem.”
18937	23	66	14	‡When you see this, you will be happy, ‡and you will be revived. ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will reveal his power to his servants‡and his anger to his enemies.
18938	23	66	15	‡For look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> comes with fire,‡his chariots come like a windstorm, ‡to reveal his raging anger,‡his battle cry, and his flaming arrows.
18939	23	66	16	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> judges all humanity ‡with fire and his sword;‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will kill many.
18940	23	66	17	¶“As for those who consecrate and ritually purify themselves so they can follow their leader and worship in the sacred orchards, those who eat the flesh of pigs and other disgusting creatures, like mice – they will all be destroyed together,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18941	23	66	18	“I hate their deeds and thoughts! So I am coming to gather all the nations and ethnic groups; they will come and witness my splendor.
18942	23	66	19	I will perform a mighty act among them and then send some of those who remain to the nations – to Tarshish, Pul, Lud (known for its archers), Tubal, Javan, and to the distant coastlands that have not heard about me or seen my splendor. They will tell the nations of my splendor.
18943	23	66	20	They will bring back all your countrymen from all the nations as an offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. They will bring them on horses, in chariots, in wagons, on mules, and on camels to my holy hill Jerusalem,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “just as the Israelites bring offerings to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple in ritually pure containers.
18944	23	66	21	And I will choose some of them as priests and Levites,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18945	23	66	22	“For just as the new heavens and the new earth I am about to make will remain standing before me,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “so your descendants and your name will remain.
18946	23	66	23	From one month to the next and from one Sabbath to the next, all people will come to worship me,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18947	23	66	24	“They will go out and observe the corpses of those who rebelled against me, for the maggots that eat them will not die, and the fire that consumes them will not die out. All people will find the sight abhorrent.”
18948	24	1	1	¶The following is a record of what Jeremiah son of Hilkiah prophesied. He was one of the priests who lived at Anathoth in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin.
18949	24	1	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to him in the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon ruled over Judah.
18950	24	1	3	It also came in the days of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, and continued until the eleventh year of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile in the fifth month of that year.
18951	24	1	4	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me,
18952	24	1	5	‡“Before I formed you in your mother’s womb I chose you. ‡Before you were born I set you apart.‡I appointed you to be a prophet to the nations.”
18953	24	1	6	¶I answered, “Oh, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, Really I do not know how to speak well enough for that, for I am too young.”
18954	24	1	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am too young.’ But go to whomever I send you and say whatever I tell you.
18955	24	1	8	Do not be afraid of those to whom I send you, for I will be with you to protect you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18956	24	1	9	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, “I will most assuredly give you the words you are to speak for me.
18957	24	1	10	Know for certain that I hereby give you the authority to announce to nations and kingdoms that they will be uprooted and torn down, destroyed and demolished, rebuilt and firmly planted.”
18958	24	1	11	¶Later the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I answered, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”
18959	24	1	12	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “You have observed correctly. This means I am watching to make sure my threats are carried out.”
18960	24	1	13	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me a second time, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a pot of boiling water; it is tipped away from the north.”
18961	24	1	14	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “From the north destruction will break out on all who live in the land.
18962	24	1	15	For I will soon summon all the peoples of the kingdoms of the north,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. “They will come and their kings will set up their thrones near the entrances of the gates of Jerusalem. They will attack all the walls surrounding it, and all the towns in Judah.
18963	24	1	16	In this way I will pass sentence on the people of Jerusalem and Judah because of all their wickedness. For they rejected me and offered sacrifices to other gods, worshiping what they made with their own hands.”
18964	24	1	17	¶“But you, Jeremiah, get yourself ready! Go and tell these people everything I instruct you to say. Do not be terrified of them, or I will give you good reason to be terrified of them.
18965	24	1	18	I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, hereby promise to make you as strong as a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall. You will be able to stand up against all who live in the land, including the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and all the people of the land.
18966	24	1	19	They will attack you but they will not be able to overcome you, for I will be with you to rescue you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18967	24	2	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me,
18968	24	2	2	“Go and declare in the hearing of the people of Jerusalem: ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: “I have fond memories of you, how devoted you were to me in your early years. I remember how you loved me like a new bride; you followed me through the wilderness, through a land that had never been planted.
18969	24	2	3	Israel was set apart to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord; </span>they were like the first fruits of a harvest to him. All who tried to devour them were punished; disaster came upon them,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
18970	24	2	4	‡Now listen to what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message, you descendants of Jacob,‡all you family groups from the nation of Israel.
18971	24	2	5	‡This is what the Lord says:‡“What fault could your ancestors have possibly found in me‡that they strayed so far from me? ‡They paid allegiance to worthless idols, and so became worthless to me.
18972	24	2	6	‡They did not ask:‡‘Where is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who delivered us out of Egypt,‡who brought us through the wilderness,‡through a land of valleys and gorges, ‡through a land of desert and deep darkness, ‡through a land in which no one travels,‡and where no one lives?’
18973	24	2	7	‡I brought you into a fertile land‡so you could enjoy its fruits and its rich bounty.‡But when you entered my land, you defiled it; ‡you made the land I call my own loathsome to me.
18974	24	2	8	‡Your priests did not ask, ‘Where is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?’ ‡Those responsible for teaching my law did not really know me. ‡Your rulers rebelled against me.‡Your prophets prophesied in the name of the god Baal. ‡They all worshiped idols that could not help them.
18975	24	2	9	‡“So, once more I will state my case against you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“I will also state it against your children and grandchildren.
18976	24	2	10	‡Go west across the sea to the coasts of Cyprus and see.‡Send someone east to Kedar and have them look carefully.‡See if such a thing as this has ever happened:
18977	24	2	11	‡Has a nation ever changed its gods‡(even though they are not really gods at all)?‡But my people have exchanged me, their glorious God, ‡for a god that cannot help them at all!
18978	24	2	12	‡Be amazed at this, O heavens! ‡Be shocked and utterly dumbfounded,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18979	24	2	13	‡“Do so because my people have committed a double wrong:‡they have rejected me,‡the fountain of life-giving water, ‡and they have dug cisterns for themselves,‡cracked cisterns which cannot even hold water.”
18980	24	2	14	‡“Israel is not a slave, is he?‡He was not born into slavery, was he? ‡If not, why then is he being carried off?
18981	24	2	15	‡Like lions his enemies roar victoriously over him;‡they raise their voices in triumph. ‡They have laid his land waste;‡his cities have been burned down and deserted.
18982	24	2	16	‡Even the soldiers from Memphis and Tahpanhes‡have cracked your skulls, people of Israel.
18983	24	2	17	‡You have brought all this on yourself, Israel, ‡by deserting the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God when he was leading you along the right path.
18984	24	2	18	‡What good will it do you then to go down to Egypt‡to seek help from the Egyptians? ‡What good will it do you to go over to Assyria‡to seek help from the Assyrians?
18985	24	2	19	‡Your own wickedness will bring about your punishment.‡Your unfaithful acts will bring down discipline on you. ‡Know, then, and realize how utterly harmful ‡it was for you to reject me, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God, ‡to show no respect for me,” ‡says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
18986	24	2	20	‡“Indeed, long ago you threw off my authority‡and refused to be subject to me. ‡You said, ‘I will not serve you.’ ‡Instead, you gave yourself to other gods on every high hill‡and under every green tree,‡like a prostitute sprawls out before her lovers.
18987	24	2	21	‡I planted you in the land ‡like a special vine of the very best stock.‡Why in the world have you turned into something like a wild vine‡that produces rotten, foul-smelling grapes?
18988	24	2	22	‡You can try to wash away your guilt with a strong detergent.‡You can use as much soap as you want.‡But the stain of your guilt is still there for me to see,” ‡says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18989	24	2	23	‡“How can you say, ‘I have not made myself unclean.‡I have not paid allegiance to the gods called Baal.’‡Just look at the way you have behaved in the Valley of Hinnom! ‡Think about the things you have done there!‡You are like a flighty, young female camel‡that rushes here and there, crisscrossing its path.
18990	24	2	24	‡You are like a wild female donkey brought up in the wilderness.‡In her lust she sniffs the wind to get the scent of a male. ‡No one can hold her back when she is in heat.‡None of the males need wear themselves out chasing after her.‡At mating time she is easy to find.
18991	24	2	25	‡Do not chase after other gods until your shoes wear out‡and your throats become dry. ‡But you say, ‘It is useless for you to try and stop me‡because I love those foreign gods and want to pursue them!’
18992	24	2	26	‡Just as a thief has to suffer dishonor when he is caught,‡so the people of Israel will suffer dishonor for what they have done. ‡So will their kings and officials,‡their priests and their prophets.
18993	24	2	27	‡They say to a wooden idol, ‘You are my father.’‡They say to a stone image, ‘You gave birth to me.’ ‡Yes, they have turned away from me instead of turning to me. ‡Yet when they are in trouble, they say, ‘Come and save us!’
18994	24	2	28	‡But where are the gods you made for yourselves?‡Let them save you when you are in trouble.‡The sad fact is that you have as many gods‡as you have towns, Judah.
18995	24	2	29	‡“Why do you try to refute me? ‡All of you have rebelled against me,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
18996	24	2	30	‡“It did no good for me to punish your people.‡They did not respond to such correction.‡You slaughtered your prophets‡like a voracious lion.”
18997	24	2	31	‡You people of this generation, ‡listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message.‡“Have I been like a wilderness to you, Israel?‡Have I been like a dark and dangerous land to you? ‡Why then do you say, ‘We are free to wander. ‡We will not come to you any more?’
18998	24	2	32	‡Does a young woman forget to put on her jewels?‡Does a bride forget to put on her bridal attire?‡But my people have forgotten me ‡for more days than can even be counted.
18999	24	2	33	‡“My, how good you have become‡at chasing after your lovers! ‡Why, you could even teach prostitutes a thing or two!
19000	24	2	34	‡Even your clothes are stained with‡the lifeblood of the poor who had not done anything wrong; ‡you did not catch them breaking into your homes. ‡Yet, in spite of all these things you have done,
19001	24	2	35	‡you say, ‘I have not done anything wrong,‡so the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> cannot really be angry with me any more.’‡But, watch out! I will bring down judgment on you‡because you say, ‘I have not committed any sin.’
19002	24	2	36	‡Why do you constantly go about ‡changing your political allegiances? ‡You will get no help from Egypt‡just as you got no help from Assyria.
19003	24	2	37	‡Moreover, you will come away from Egypt‡with your hands covering your faces in sorrow and shame ‡because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will not allow your reliance on them to be successful‡and you will not gain any help from them.
19004	24	3	1	‡“If a man divorces his wife‡and she leaves him and becomes another man’s wife,‡he may not take her back again. ‡Doing that would utterly defile the land. ‡But you, Israel, have given yourself as a prostitute to many gods. ‡So what makes you think you can return to me?” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19005	24	3	2	‡“Look up at the hilltops and consider this. ‡Where have you not been ravished? ‡You waited for those gods like a thief lying in wait in the wilderness. ‡You defiled the land by your wicked prostitution to other gods.
19006	24	3	3	‡That is why the rains have been withheld,‡and the spring rains have not come.‡Yet in spite of this you are obstinate as a prostitute. ‡You refuse to be ashamed of what you have done.
19007	24	3	4	‡Even now you say to me, ‘You are my father! ‡You have been my faithful companion ever since I was young.
19008	24	3	5	‡You will not always be angry with me, will you?‡You will not be mad at me forever, will you?’ ‡That is what you say,‡but you continually do all the evil that you can.”
19009	24	3	6	¶When Josiah was king of Judah, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Jeremiah, you have no doubt seen what wayward Israel has done. You have seen how she went up to every high hill and under every green tree to give herself like a prostitute to other gods.
19010	24	3	7	Yet even after she had done all that, I thought that she might come back to me. But she did not. Her sister, unfaithful Judah, saw what she did.
19011	24	3	8	She also saw that, because of wayward Israel’s adulterous worship of other gods, I sent her away and gave her divorce papers. But still her unfaithful sister Judah was not afraid, and she too went and gave herself like a prostitute to other gods.
19012	24	3	9	Because she took her prostitution so lightly, she defiled the land through her adulterous worship of gods made of wood and stone.
19013	24	3	10	In spite of all this, Israel’s sister, unfaithful Judah, has not turned back to me with any sincerity; she has only pretended to do so,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19014	24	3	11	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Under the circumstances, wayward Israel could even be considered less guilty than unfaithful Judah.
19015	24	3	12	¶“Go and shout this message to my people in the countries in the north. Tell them, ‡‘Come back to me, wayward Israel,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡‘I will not continue to look on you with displeasure. ‡For I am merciful,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡‘I will not be angry with you forever.
19016	24	3	13	‡However, you must confess that you have done wrong, ‡and that you have rebelled against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.‡You must confess that you have given yourself to foreign gods under every green tree,‡and have not obeyed my commands,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19017	24	3	14	¶“Come back to me, my wayward sons,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “for I am your true master. If you do, I will take one of you from each town and two of you from each family group, and I will bring you back to Zion.
19018	24	3	15	I will give you leaders who will be faithful to me. They will lead you with knowledge and insight.
19019	24	3	16	In those days, your population will greatly increase in the land. At that time,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “people will no longer talk about having the ark that contains the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s covenant with us. They will not call it to mind, remember it, or miss it. No, that will not be done any more!
19020	24	3	17	At that time the city of Jerusalem will be called the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s throne. All nations will gather there in Jerusalem to honor the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s name. They will no longer follow the stubborn inclinations of their own evil hearts.
19021	24	3	18	At that time the nation of Judah and the nation of Israel will be reunited. Together they will come back from a land in the north to the land that I gave to your ancestors as a permanent possession.
19022	24	3	19	‡“I thought to myself, ‡‘Oh what a joy it would be for me to treat you like a son! ‡What a joy it would be for me to give you a pleasant land,‡the most beautiful piece of property there is in all the world!’ ‡I thought you would call me, ‘Father’ ‡and would never cease being loyal to me.
19023	24	3	20	‡But, you have been unfaithful to me, nation of Israel, ‡like an unfaithful wife who has left her husband,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19024	24	3	21	‡“A noise is heard on the hilltops.‡It is the sound of the people of Israel crying and pleading to their gods.‡Indeed they have followed sinful ways; ‡they have forgotten to be true to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God.
19025	24	3	22	‡Come back to me, you wayward people.‡I want to cure your waywardness. ‡Say, ‘Here we are. We come to you‡because you are the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.
19026	24	3	23	‡We know our noisy worship of false gods ‡on the hills and mountains did not help us. ‡We know that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God ‡is the only one who can deliver Israel.
19027	24	3	24	‡From earliest times our worship of that shameful god, Baal, ‡has taken away all that our ancestors worked for.‡It has taken away our flocks and our herds,‡and even our sons and daughters.
19028	24	3	25	‡Let us acknowledge our shame.‡Let us bear the disgrace that we deserve. ‡For we have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God,‡both we and our ancestors.‡From earliest times to this very day‡we have not obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.’
19029	24	4	1	‡“If you, Israel, want to come back,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span>‡“if you want to come back to me, ‡you must get those disgusting idols out of my sight‡and must no longer go astray.
19030	24	4	2	‡You must be truthful, honest and upright‡when you take an oath saying, ‘As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives!’ ‡If you do, the nations will pray to be as blessed by him as you are‡and will make him the object of their boasting.”
19031	24	4	3	‡Yes, this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said ‡to the people of Judah and Jerusalem: ‡“Break up your unplowed ground, do not cast seeds among thorns.
19032	24	4	4	‡Commit yourselves to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡Dedicate your hearts to me, ‡people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem.‡Otherwise, my anger will blaze up like a flaming fire against you‡that no one will be able to extinguish.‡That will happen because of the evil you have done.”
19033	24	4	5	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‡“Announce this in Judah and proclaim it in Jerusalem: ‡‘Sound the trumpet throughout the land!’‡Shout out loudly,‡‘Gather together! Let us flee into the fortified cities!’
19034	24	4	6	‡Raise a signal flag that tells people to go to Zion. ‡Run for safety! Do not delay!‡For I am about to bring disaster out of the north.‡It will bring great destruction.
19035	24	4	7	‡Like a lion that has come up from its lair ‡the one who destroys nations has set out from his home base. ‡He is coming out to lay your land waste.‡Your cities will become ruins and lie uninhabited.
19036	24	4	8	‡So put on sackcloth!‡Mourn and wail, saying,‡‘The fierce anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡has not turned away from us!’”
19037	24	4	9	‡“When this happens,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡“the king and his officials will lose their courage.‡The priests will be struck with horror,‡and the prophets will be speechless in astonishment.”
19038	24	4	10	¶In response to all this I said, “Ah, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you have surely allowed the people of Judah and Jerusalem to be deceived by those who say, ‘You will be safe!’ But in fact a sword is already at our throats.”
19039	24	4	11	‡“At that time the people of Judah and Jerusalem will be told,‡‘A scorching wind will sweep down‡from the hilltops in the wilderness on my dear people. ‡It will not be a gentle breeze‡for winnowing the grain and blowing away the chaff.
19040	24	4	12	‡No, a wind too strong for that will come at my bidding.‡Yes, even now I, myself, am calling down judgment on them.’
19041	24	4	13	‡Look! The enemy is approaching like gathering clouds. ‡The roar of his chariots is like that of a whirlwind. ‡His horses move more swiftly than eagles.”‡I cry out, “We are doomed, for we will be destroyed!”
19042	24	4	14	‡“Oh people of Jerusalem, purify your hearts from evil ‡so that you may yet be delivered.‡How long will you continue to harbor up‡wicked schemes within you?
19043	24	4	15	‡For messengers are coming, heralding disaster,‡from the city of Dan and from the hills of Ephraim.
19044	24	4	16	‡They are saying, ‡‘Announce to the surrounding nations, ‡“The enemy is coming!” ‡Proclaim this message to Jerusalem:‡“Those who besiege cities are coming from a distant land.‡They are ready to raise the battle cry against the towns in Judah.”’
19045	24	4	17	‡They will surround Jerusalem ‡like men guarding a field ‡because they have rebelled against me,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19046	24	4	18	‡“The way you have lived and the things you have done ‡will bring this on you.‡This is the punishment you deserve, and it will be painful indeed. ‡The pain will be so bad it will pierce your heart.”
19047	24	4	19	¶I said, ‡“Oh, the feeling in the pit of my stomach! ‡I writhe in anguish.‡Oh, the pain in my heart! ‡My heart pounds within me.‡I cannot keep silent.‡For I hear the sound of the trumpet; ‡the sound of the battle cry pierces my soul!
19048	24	4	20	‡I see one destruction after another taking place,‡so that the whole land lies in ruins.‡I see our tents suddenly destroyed,‡their curtains torn down in a mere instant.
19049	24	4	21	‡“How long must I see the enemy’s battle flags‡and hear the military signals of their bugles?”
19050	24	4	22	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answered, ‡“This will happen because my people are foolish.‡They do not know me.‡They are like children who have no sense. ‡They have no understanding.‡They are skilled at doing evil.‡They do not know how to do good.”
19051	24	4	23	‡“I looked at the land and saw that it was an empty wasteland. ‡I looked up at the sky, and its light had vanished.
19052	24	4	24	‡I looked at the mountains and saw that they were shaking.‡All the hills were swaying back and forth!
19053	24	4	25	‡I looked and saw that there were no more people, ‡and that all the birds in the sky had flown away.
19054	24	4	26	‡I looked and saw that the fruitful land had become a desert‡and that all of the cities had been laid in ruins.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had brought this all about‡because of his blazing anger.
19055	24	4	27	‡All this will happen because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‡“The whole land will be desolate;‡however, I will not completely destroy it.
19056	24	4	28	‡Because of this the land will mourn‡and the sky above will grow black. ‡For I have made my purpose known ‡and I will not relent or turn back from carrying it out.”
19057	24	4	29	‡At the sound of the approaching horsemen and archers‡the people of every town will flee.‡Some of them will hide in the thickets.‡Others will climb up among the rocks.‡All the cities will be deserted.‡No one will remain in them.
19058	24	4	30	‡And you, Zion, city doomed to destruction, ‡you accomplish nothing by wearing a beautiful dress, ‡decking yourself out in jewels of gold,‡and putting on eye shadow! ‡You are making yourself beautiful for nothing.‡Your lovers spurn you.‡They want to kill you.
19059	24	4	31	‡In fact, I hear a cry like that of a woman in labor,‡a cry of anguish like that of a woman giving birth to her first baby.‡It is the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath,‡reaching out for help, saying, “I am done in! ‡My life is ebbing away before these murderers!”
19060	24	5	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‡“Go up and down through the streets of Jerusalem. ‡Look around and see for yourselves.‡Search through its public squares.‡See if any of you can find a single person‡who deals honestly and tries to be truthful. ‡If you can, then I will not punish this city.
19061	24	5	2	‡These people make promises in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‡But the fact is, what they swear to is really a lie.”
19062	24	5	3	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I know you look for faithfulness. ‡But even when you punish these people, they feel no remorse. ‡Even when you nearly destroy them, they refuse to be corrected.‡They have become as hardheaded as a rock. ‡They refuse to change their ways.
19063	24	5	4	‡I thought, “Surely it is only the ignorant poor who act this way. ‡They act like fools because they do not know what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> demands. ‡They do not know what their God requires of them.
19064	24	5	5	‡I will go to the leaders ‡and speak with them.‡Surely they know what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> demands. ‡Surely they know what their God requires of them.” ‡Yet all of them, too, have rejected his authority‡and refuse to submit to him.
19065	24	5	6	‡So like a lion from the thicket their enemies will kill them.‡Like a wolf from the rift valley they will destroy them.‡Like a leopard they will lie in wait outside their cities‡and totally destroy anyone who ventures out. ‡For they have rebelled so much‡and done so many unfaithful things.
19066	24	5	7	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> asked, ‡“How can I leave you unpunished, Jerusalem? ‡Your people have rejected me‡and have worshiped gods that are not gods at all. ‡Even though I supplied all their needs, they were like an unfaithful wife to me. ‡They went flocking to the houses of prostitutes.
19067	24	5	8	‡They are like lusty, well-fed stallions.‡Each of them lusts after his neighbor’s wife.
19068	24	5	9	‡I will surely punish them for doing such things!” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“I will surely bring retribution on such a nation as this!”
19069	24	5	10	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded the enemy, ‡“March through the vineyards of Israel and Judah and ruin them. ‡But do not destroy them completely.‡Strip off their branches‡for these people do not belong to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19070	24	5	11	‡For the nations of Israel and Judah ‡have been very unfaithful to me,”¶says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19071	24	5	12	‡“These people have denied what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says. ‡They have said, ‘That is not so! ‡No harm will come to us.‡We will not experience war and famine.
19072	24	5	13	‡The prophets will prove to be full of wind. ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not spoken through them. ‡So, let what they say happen to them.’”
19073	24	5	14	¶Because of that, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, said to me, ‡“Because these people have spoken like this, ‡I will make the words that I put in your mouth like fire.‡And I will make this people like wood ‡which the fiery judgments you speak will burn up.”
19074	24	5	15	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “Listen, nation of Israel! ‡I am about to bring a nation from far away to attack you.‡It will be a nation that was founded long ago‡and has lasted for a long time.‡It will be a nation whose language you will not know.‡Its people will speak words that you will not be able to understand.
19075	24	5	16	‡All of its soldiers are strong and mighty. ‡Their arrows will send you to your grave.
19076	24	5	17	‡They will eat up your crops and your food.‡They will kill off your sons and your daughters.‡They will eat up your sheep and your cattle.‡They will destroy your vines and your fig trees. ‡Their weapons will batter down ‡the fortified cities you trust in.
19077	24	5	18	¶Yet even then I will not completely destroy you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19078	24	5	19	“So then, Jeremiah, when your people ask, ‘Why has the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God done all this to us?’ tell them, ‘It is because you rejected me and served foreign gods in your own land. So you must serve foreigners in a land that does not belong to you.’
19079	24	5	20	‡“Proclaim this message among the descendants of Jacob. ‡Make it known throughout Judah.
19080	24	5	21	‡Tell them: ‘Hear this,‡you foolish people who have no understanding,‡who have eyes but do not discern,‡who have ears but do not perceive:
19081	24	5	22	‡“You should fear me!” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“You should tremble in awe before me! ‡I made the sand to be a boundary for the sea,‡a permanent barrier that it can never cross.‡Its waves may roll, but they can never prevail.‡They may roar, but they can never cross beyond that boundary.”
19082	24	5	23	‡But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts.‡They have turned aside and gone their own way.
19083	24	5	24	‡They do not say to themselves, ‡“Let us revere the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.‡It is he who gives us the autumn rains and the spring rains at the proper time.‡It is he who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.”
19084	24	5	25	‡Your misdeeds have stopped these things from coming. ‡Your sins have deprived you of my bounty.’
19085	24	5	26	‡“Indeed, there are wicked scoundrels among my people.‡They lie in wait like bird catchers hiding in ambush. ‡They set deadly traps to catch people.
19086	24	5	27	‡Like a cage filled with the birds that have been caught, ‡their houses are filled with the gains of their fraud and deceit. ‡That is how they have gotten so rich and powerful.
19087	24	5	28	‡That is how they have grown fat and sleek. ‡There is no limit to the evil things they do. ‡They do not plead the cause of the fatherless in such a way as to win it.‡They do not defend the rights of the poor.
19088	24	5	29	‡I will certainly punish them for doing such things!” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“I will certainly bring retribution on such a nation as this!
19089	24	5	30	‡“Something horrible and shocking‡is going on in the land of Judah:
19090	24	5	31	‡The prophets prophesy lies.‡The priests exercise power by their own authority. ‡And my people love to have it this way.‡But they will not be able to help you when the time of judgment comes!
19091	24	6	1	‡“Run for safety, people of Benjamin!‡Get out of Jerusalem! ‡Sound the trumpet in Tekoa!‡Light the signal fires at Beth Hakkerem!‡For disaster lurks out of the north;‡it will bring great destruction.
19092	24	6	2	‡I will destroy Daughter Zion, ‡who is as delicate and defenseless as a young maiden.
19093	24	6	3	‡Kings will attack it with their armies. ‡They will encamp in siege all around it. ‡Each of them will devastate the portion assigned to him.
19094	24	6	4	‡They will say, ‘Prepare to do battle against it!‡Come on! Let’s attack it at noon!’‡But later they will say, ‘Woe to us! ‡For the day is almost over‡and the shadows of evening are getting long.
19095	24	6	5	‡So come on, let’s go ahead and attack it by night‡and destroy all its fortified buildings.’
19096	24	6	6	‡All of this is because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has said:‡‘Cut down the trees around Jerusalem‡and build up a siege ramp against its walls. ‡This is the city which is to be punished. ‡Nothing but oppression happens in it.
19097	24	6	7	‡As a well continually pours out fresh water‡so it continually pours out wicked deeds. ‡Sounds of violence and destruction echo throughout it. ‡All I see are sick and wounded people.’
19098	24	6	8	‡So take warning, Jerusalem,‡or I will abandon you in disgust ‡and make you desolate,‡a place where no one can live.”
19099	24	6	9	¶This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies said to me: ‡“Those who remain in Israel will be ‡like the grapes thoroughly gleaned from a vine.‡So go over them again, as though you were a grape harvester‡passing your hand over the branches one last time.”
19100	24	6	10	¶I answered, ‡“Who would listen‡if I spoke to them and warned them? ‡Their ears are so closed ‡that they cannot hear!‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message is offensive to them.‡They do not like it at all.
19101	24	6	11	‡I am as full of anger as you are, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡I am tired of trying to hold it in.”¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answered, ‡“Vent it, then, on the children who play in the street‡and on the young men who are gathered together.‡Husbands and wives are to be included, ‡as well as the old and those who are advanced in years.
19102	24	6	12	‡Their houses will be turned over to others‡as will their fields and their wives.‡For I will unleash my power ‡against those who live in this land,”¶says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19103	24	6	13	‡“That is because, from the least important to the most important of them,‡all of them are greedy for dishonest gain.‡Prophets and priests alike,‡all of them practice deceit.
19104	24	6	14	‡They offer only superficial help ‡for the harm my people have suffered. ‡They say, ‘Everything will be all right!’‡But everything is not all right!
19105	24	6	15	‡Are they ashamed because they have done such shameful things?‡No, they are not at all ashamed.‡They do not even know how to blush!‡So they will die, just like others have died. ‡They will be brought to ruin when I punish them,”¶says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19106	24	6	16	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to his people: ‡“You are standing at the crossroads. So consider your path. ‡Ask where the old, reliable paths are.‡Ask where the path is that leads to blessing and follow it.‡If you do, you will find rest for your souls.”‡But they said, “We will not follow it!”
19107	24	6	17	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‡“I appointed prophets as watchmen to warn you, saying:‡‘Pay attention to the warning sound of the trumpet!’” ‡But they said, “We will not pay attention!”
19108	24	6	18	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‡“Hear, you nations!‡Be witnesses and take note of what will happen to these people.
19109	24	6	19	‡Hear this, you peoples of the earth: ‡‘Take note! I am about to bring disaster on these people.‡It will come as punishment for their scheming. ‡For they have paid no attention to what I have said, ‡and they have rejected my law.
19110	24	6	20	‡I take no delight when they offer up to me ‡frankincense that comes from Sheba ‡or sweet-smelling cane imported from a faraway land.‡I cannot accept the burnt offerings they bring me.‡I get no pleasure from the sacrifices they offer to me.’
19111	24	6	21	‡So, this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡‘I will assuredly make these people stumble to their doom. ‡Parents and children will stumble and fall to their destruction. ‡Friends and neighbors will die.’
19112	24	6	22	‡“This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡‘Beware! An army is coming from a land in the north.‡A mighty nation is stirring into action in faraway parts of the earth.
19113	24	6	23	‡Its soldiers are armed with bows and spears.‡They are cruel and show no mercy.‡They sound like the roaring sea‡as they ride forth on their horses.‡Lined up in formation like men going into battle‡to attack you, Daughter Zion.’”
19114	24	6	24	‡The people cry out, “We have heard reports about them!‡We have become helpless with fear! ‡Anguish grips us,‡agony like that of a woman giving birth to a baby!
19115	24	6	25	‡Do not go out into the countryside.‡Do not travel on the roads.‡For the enemy is there with sword in hand. ‡They are spreading terror everywhere.”
19116	24	6	26	‡So I said, “Oh, my dear people, put on sackcloth‡and roll in ashes.‡Mourn with painful sobs‡as though you had lost your only child.‡For any moment now that destructive army ‡will come against us.”
19117	24	6	27	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, ‡“I have made you like a metal assayer‡to test my people like ore. ‡You are to observe them‡and evaluate how they behave.”
19118	24	6	28	¶I reported, ‡“All of them are the most stubborn of rebels! ‡They are as hard as bronze or iron.‡They go about telling lies.‡They all deal corruptly.
19119	24	6	29	‡The fiery bellows of judgment burn fiercely.‡But there is too much dross to be removed. ‡The process of refining them has proved useless. ‡The wicked have not been purged.
19120	24	6	30	‡They are regarded as ‘rejected silver’ ‡because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rejects them.”
19121	24	7	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Jeremiah:
19122	24	7	2	“Stand in the gate of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and proclaim this message: ‘Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message, all you people of Judah who have passed through these gates to worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19123	24	7	3	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says: Change the way you have been living and do what is right. If you do, I will allow you to continue to live in this land.
19124	24	7	4	Stop putting your confidence in the false belief that says, “We are safe! The temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is here! The temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is here! The temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is here!”
19125	24	7	5	You must change the way you have been living and do what is right. You must treat one another fairly.
19126	24	7	6	Stop oppressing resident foreigners who live in your land, children who have lost their fathers, and women who have lost their husbands. Stop killing innocent people in this land. Stop paying allegiance to other gods. That will only bring about your ruin.
19127	24	7	7	If you stop doing these things, I will allow you to continue to live in this land which I gave to your ancestors as a lasting possession.
19128	24	7	8	¶“‘But just look at you! You are putting your confidence in a false belief that will not deliver you.
19129	24	7	9	You steal. You murder. You commit adultery. You lie when you swear on oath. You sacrifice to the god Baal. You pay allegiance to other gods whom you have not previously known.
19130	24	7	10	Then you come and stand in my presence in this temple I have claimed as my own and say, “We are safe!” You think you are so safe that you go on doing all those hateful sins!
19131	24	7	11	Do you think this temple I have claimed as my own is to be a hideout for robbers? You had better take note! I have seen for myself what you have done! says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19132	24	7	12	So, go to the place in Shiloh where I allowed myself to be worshiped in the early days. See what I did to it because of the wicked things my people Israel did.
19133	24	7	13	You also have done all these things, says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and I have spoken to you over and over again. But you have not listened! You have refused to respond when I called you to repent!
19134	24	7	14	So I will destroy this temple which I have claimed as my own, this temple that you are trusting to protect you. I will destroy this place that I gave to you and your ancestors, just like I destroyed Shiloh.
19135	24	7	15	And I will drive you out of my sight just like I drove out your relatives, the people of Israel.’”
19136	24	7	16	¶“But as for you, Jeremiah, do not pray for these people! Do not raise a cry of prayer for them! Do not plead with me to save them, because I will not listen to you.
19137	24	7	17	Do you see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
19138	24	7	18	Children are gathering firewood, fathers are building fires with it, and women are mixing dough to bake cakes to offer to the goddess they call the Queen of Heaven. They are also pouring out drink offerings to other gods. They seem to do all this just to trouble me.
19139	24	7	19	But I am not really the one being troubled!” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. “Rather they are bringing trouble on themselves to their own shame!
19140	24	7	20	So,” the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “my raging fury will be poured out on this land. It will be poured out on human beings and animals, on trees and crops. And it will burn like a fire which cannot be extinguished.”
19141	24	7	21	¶“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says to the people of Judah : ‘You might as well go ahead and add the meat of your burnt offerings to that of the other sacrifices and eat it, too!
19142	24	7	22	Consider this: When I spoke to your ancestors after I brought them out of Egypt, I did not merely give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.
19143	24	7	23	I also explicitly commanded them: “Obey me. If you do, I will be your God and you will be my people. Live exactly the way I tell you and things will go well with you.”
19144	24	7	24	But they did not listen to me or pay any attention to me. They followed the stubborn inclinations of their own wicked hearts. They acted worse and worse instead of better.
19145	24	7	25	From the time your ancestors departed the land of Egypt until now, I sent my servants the prophets to you again and again, day after day.
19146	24	7	26	But your ancestors did not listen to me nor pay attention to me. They became obstinate and were more wicked than even their own forefathers.’”
19147	24	7	27	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “When you tell them all this, they will not listen to you. When you call out to them, they will not respond to you.
19148	24	7	28	So tell them: ‘This is a nation that has not obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God and has not accepted correction. Faithfulness is nowhere to be found in it. These people do not even profess it anymore.
19149	24	7	29	So, mourn, you people of this nation. Cut off your hair and throw it away. Sing a song of mourning on the hilltops. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has decided to reject and forsake this generation that has provoked his wrath!’”
19150	24	7	30	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “I have rejected them because the people of Judah have done what I consider evil. They have set up their disgusting idols in the temple which I have claimed for my own and have defiled it.
19151	24	7	31	They have also built places of worship in a place called Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom so that they can sacrifice their sons and daughters by fire. That is something I never commanded them to do! Indeed, it never even entered my mind to command such a thing!
19152	24	7	32	So, watch out!” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. “The time will soon come when people will no longer call those places Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom. But they will call that valley the Valley of Slaughter and they will bury so many people in Topheth they will run out of room.
19153	24	7	33	Then the dead bodies of these people will be left on the ground for the birds and wild animals to eat. There will not be any survivors to scare them away.
19154	24	7	34	I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness, or the glad celebration of brides and grooms throughout the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. For the whole land will become a desolate wasteland.”
19155	24	8	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “When that time comes, the bones of the kings of Judah and its leaders, the bones of the priests and prophets and of all the other people who lived in Jerusalem will be dug up from their graves.
19156	24	8	2	They will be spread out and exposed to the sun, the moon and the stars. These are things they adored and served, things to which they paid allegiance, from which they sought guidance, and worshiped. The bones of these people will never be regathered and reburied. They will be like manure used to fertilize the ground.
19157	24	8	3	However, I will leave some of these wicked people alive and banish them to other places. But wherever these people who survive may go, they will wish they had died rather than lived,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
19158	24	8	4	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, ‡“Tell them, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡Do people not get back up when they fall down?‡Do they not turn around when they go the wrong way?
19159	24	8	5	‡Why, then, do these people of Jerusalem ‡continually turn away from me in apostasy?‡They hold fast to their deception. ‡They refuse to turn back to me.
19160	24	8	6	‡I have listened to them very carefully, ‡but they do not speak honestly.‡None of them regrets the evil he has done.‡None of them says, “I have done wrong!” ‡All of them persist in their own wayward course ‡like a horse charging recklessly into battle.
19161	24	8	7	‡Even the stork knows ‡when it is time to move on. ‡The turtledove, swallow, and crane ‡recognize the normal times for their migration.‡But my people pay no attention‡to what I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, require of them.
19162	24	8	8	‡How can you say, “We are wise!‡We have the law of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>”?‡The truth is, those who teach it have used their writings‡to make it say what it does not really mean.
19163	24	8	9	‡Your wise men will be put to shame.‡They will be dumbfounded and be brought to judgment. ‡Since they have rejected the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message,‡what wisdom do they really have?
19164	24	8	10	‡So I will give their wives to other men‡and their fields to new owners.‡For from the least important to the most important of them,‡all of them are greedy for dishonest gain.‡Prophets and priests alike,‡all practice deceit.
19165	24	8	11	‡They offer only superficial help ‡for the hurt my dear people have suffered. ‡They say, “Everything will be all right!”‡But everything is not all right!
19166	24	8	12	‡Are they ashamed because they have done such disgusting things?‡No, they are not at all ashamed!‡They do not even know how to blush!‡So they will die just like others have died. ‡They will be brought to ruin when I punish them,‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19167	24	8	13	‡I will take away their harvests, says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>‡There will be no grapes on their vines.‡There will be no figs on their fig trees.‡Even the leaves on their trees will wither.‡The crops that I gave them will be taken away.’”
19168	24	8	14	¶The people say, ‡“Why are we just sitting here?‡Let us gather together inside the fortified cities. ‡Let us at least die there fighting, ‡since the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God has condemned us to die.‡He has condemned us to drink the poison waters of judgment ‡because we have sinned against him.
19169	24	8	15	‡We hoped for good fortune, but nothing good has come of it.‡We hoped for a time of relief, but instead we experience terror.
19170	24	8	16	‡The snorting of the enemy’s horses‡is already being heard in the city of Dan.‡The sound of the neighing of their stallions ‡causes the whole land to tremble with fear.‡They are coming to destroy the land and everything in it!‡They are coming to destroy the cities and everyone who lives in them!”
19171	24	8	17	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‡“Yes indeed, I am sending an enemy against you‡that will be like poisonous snakes which cannot be charmed away. ‡And they will inflict fatal wounds on you.”
19172	24	8	18	¶Then I said, ‡“There is no cure for my grief!‡I am sick at heart!
19173	24	8	19	‡I hear my dear people crying out ‡throughout the length and breadth of the land. ‡They are crying, ‘Is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> no longer in Zion?‡Is her divine King no longer there?’”‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answers, ‡“Why then do they provoke me to anger with their images,‡with their worthless foreign idols?”
19174	24	8	20	‡“They cry, ‘Harvest time has come and gone, and the summer is over, ‡and still we have not been delivered.’
19175	24	8	21	‡My heart is crushed because my dear people are being crushed. ‡I go about crying and grieving. I am overwhelmed with dismay.
19176	24	8	22	‡There is still medicinal ointment available in Gilead!‡There is still a physician there! ‡Why then have my dear people ‡not been restored to health?
19177	24	9	1	‡(8:23) I wish that my head were a well full of water ‡and my eyes were a fountain full of tears!‡If they were, I could cry day and night ‡for those of my dear people who have been killed.
19178	24	9	2	‡(9:1) I wish I had a lodging place in the wilderness‡where I could spend some time like a weary traveler. ‡Then I would desert my people‡and walk away from them‡because they are all unfaithful to God,‡a congregation of people that has been disloyal to him.
19179	24	9	3	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‡“These people are like soldiers who have readied their bows.‡Their tongues are always ready to shoot out lies. ‡They have become powerful in the land, ‡but they have not done so by honest means. ‡Indeed, they do one evil thing after another ‡and do not pay attention to me.
19180	24	9	4	‡Everyone must be on his guard around his friends.‡He must not even trust any of his relatives. ‡For every one of them will find some way to cheat him. ‡And all of his friends will tell lies about him.
19181	24	9	5	‡One friend deceives another‡and no one tells the truth.‡These people have trained themselves to tell lies.‡They do wrong and are unable to repent.
19182	24	9	6	‡They do one act of violence after another,‡and one deceitful thing after another. ‡They refuse to pay attention to me,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19183	24	9	7	¶Therefore the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‡“I will now purify them in the fires of affliction and test them.‡The wickedness of my dear people has left me no choice.‡What else can I do?
19184	24	9	8	‡Their tongues are like deadly arrows. ‡They are always telling lies. ‡Friendly words for their neighbors come from their mouths.‡But their minds are thinking up ways to trap them.
19185	24	9	9	‡I will certainly punish them for doing such things!” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“I will certainly bring retribution on such a nation as this!”
19186	24	9	10	¶I said, ‡“I will weep and mourn for the grasslands on the mountains, ‡I will sing a mournful song for the pastures in the wilderness‡because they are so scorched no one travels through them.‡The sound of livestock is no longer heard there.‡Even the birds in the sky and the wild animals in the fields‡have fled and are gone.”
19187	24	9	11	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‡“I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins.‡Jackals will make their home there. ‡I will destroy the towns of Judah‡so that no one will be able to live in them.”
19188	24	9	12	¶I said, ‡“Who is wise enough to understand why this has happened? ‡Who has a word from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> that can explain it? ‡Why does the land lie in ruins?‡Why is it as scorched as a desert through which no one travels?”
19189	24	9	13	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answered, “This has happened because these people have rejected my laws which I gave them. They have not obeyed me or followed those laws.
19190	24	9	14	Instead they have followed the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts. They have paid allegiance to the gods called Baal, as their fathers taught them to do.
19191	24	9	15	So then, listen to what I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, say. ‘I will make these people eat the bitter food of suffering and drink the poison water of judgment.
19192	24	9	16	I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known anything about. I will send people chasing after them with swords until I have destroyed them.’”
19193	24	9	17	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies told me to say to this people, ‡“Take note of what I say. ‡Call for the women who mourn for the dead!‡Summon those who are the most skilled at it!”
19194	24	9	18	‡I said, “Indeed, let them come quickly and sing a song of mourning for us.‡Let them wail loudly until tears stream from our own eyes‡and our eyelids overflow with water.
19195	24	9	19	‡For the sound of wailing is soon to be heard in Zion,‡‘We are utterly ruined! We are completely disgraced!‡For we have left our land!‡For our houses have been torn down!’”
19196	24	9	20	¶I said, ‡“So now, you wailing women, listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message. ‡Open your ears to the message from his mouth.‡Teach your daughters this mournful song,‡and let every woman teach her neighbor this lament.
19197	24	9	21	‡‘Death has climbed in through our windows.‡It has entered into our fortified houses.‡It has taken away our children who play in the streets.‡It has taken away our young men who gather in the city squares.’
19198	24	9	22	‡Tell your daughters and neighbors, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“The dead bodies of people will lie scattered everywhere‡like manure scattered on a field.‡They will lie scattered on the ground ‡like grain that has been cut down but has not been gathered.”’”
19199	24	9	23	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“Wise people should not boast that they are wise.‡Powerful people should not boast that they are powerful. ‡Rich people should not boast that they are rich.
19200	24	9	24	‡If people want to boast, they should boast about this:‡They should boast that they understand and know me.‡They should boast that they know and understand‡that I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, act out of faithfulness, fairness, and justice in the earth‡and that I desire people to do these things,” ¶says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19201	24	9	25	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “Watch out! The time is soon coming when I will punish all those who are circumcised only in the flesh.
19202	24	9	26	That is, I will punish the Egyptians, the Judeans, the Edomites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, and all the desert people who cut their hair short at the temples. I will do so because none of the people of those nations are really circumcised in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sight. Moreover, none of the people of Israel are circumcised when it comes to their hearts.”
19203	24	10	1	¶You people of Israel, listen to what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has to say to you.
19204	24	10	2	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“Do not start following pagan religious practices. ‡Do not be in awe of signs that occur in the sky‡even though the nations hold them in awe.
19205	24	10	3	‡For the religion of these people is worthless.‡They cut down a tree in the forest,‡and a craftsman makes it into an idol with his tools.
19206	24	10	4	‡He decorates it with overlays of silver and gold.‡He uses hammer and nails to fasten it together‡so that it will not fall over.
19207	24	10	5	‡Such idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field.‡They cannot talk.‡They must be carried ‡because they cannot walk.‡Do not be afraid of them‡because they cannot hurt you.‡And they do not have any power to help you.”
19208	24	10	6	¶I said, ‡“There is no one like you, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‡You are great.‡And you are renowned for your power.
19209	24	10	7	‡Everyone should revere you, O King of all nations, ‡because you deserve to be revered. ‡For there is no one like you‡among any of the wise people of the nations nor among any of their kings.
19210	24	10	8	‡The people of those nations are both stupid and foolish.‡Instruction from a wooden idol is worthless!
19211	24	10	9	‡Hammered-out silver is brought from Tarshish ‡and gold is brought from Ufaz to cover those idols. ‡They are the handiwork of carpenters and goldsmiths. ‡They are clothed in blue and purple clothes. ‡They are all made by skillful workers.
19212	24	10	10	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the only true God.‡He is the living God and the everlasting King.‡When he shows his anger the earth shakes.‡None of the nations can stand up to his fury.
19213	24	10	11	‡You people of Israel should tell those nations this:‡‘These gods did not make heaven and earth.‡They will disappear from the earth and from under the heavens.’
19214	24	10	12	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the one who by his power made the earth.‡He is the one who by his wisdom established the world.‡And by his understanding he spread out the skies.
19215	24	10	13	‡When his voice thunders, the heavenly ocean roars.‡He makes the clouds rise from the far-off horizons. ‡He makes the lightning flash out in the midst of the rain.‡He unleashes the wind from the places where he stores it.
19216	24	10	14	‡All these idolaters will prove to be stupid and ignorant.‡Every goldsmith will be disgraced by the idol he made.‡For the image he forges is merely a sham. ‡There is no breath in any of those idols.
19217	24	10	15	‡They are worthless, mere objects to be mocked. ‡When the time comes to punish them, they will be destroyed.
19218	24	10	16	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who is the inheritance of Jacob’s descendants, is not like them.‡He is the one who created everything.‡And the people of Israel are those he claims as his own. ‡His name is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.”
19219	24	10	17	‡Gather your belongings together and prepare to leave the land,‡you people of Jerusalem who are being besieged.
19220	24	10	18	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “I will now throw out‡those who live in this land.‡I will bring so much trouble on them‡that they will actually feel it.”
19221	24	10	19	‡And I cried out, “We are doomed! ‡Our wound is severe!‡We once thought, ‘This is only an illness.‡And we will be able to bear it!’
19222	24	10	20	‡But our tents have been destroyed.‡The ropes that held them in place have been ripped apart. ‡Our children are gone and are not coming back. ‡There is no survivor to put our tents back up,‡no one left to hang their tent curtains in place.
19223	24	10	21	‡For our leaders are stupid.‡They have not sought the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s advice. ‡So they do not act wisely,‡and the people they are responsible for have all been scattered.
19224	24	10	22	‡Listen! News is coming even now. ‡The rumble of a great army is heard approaching from a land in the north. ‡It is coming to turn the towns of Judah into rubble,‡places where only jackals live.
19225	24	10	23	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, we know that people do not control their own destiny. ‡It is not in their power to determine what will happen to them.
19226	24	10	24	‡Correct us, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, but only in due measure. ‡Do not punish us in anger or you will reduce us to nothing.
19227	24	10	25	‡Vent your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you. ‡Vent it on the peoples who do not worship you. ‡For they have destroyed the people of Jacob. ‡They have completely destroyed them ‡and left their homeland in utter ruin.
19228	24	11	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Jeremiah:
19229	24	11	2	“Hear the terms of the covenant I made with Israel and pass them on to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem.
19230	24	11	3	Tell them that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> the God of Israel, says, ‘Anyone who does not keep the terms of the covenant will be under a curse.
19231	24	11	4	Those are the terms that I charged your ancestors to keep when I brought them out of Egypt, that place which was like an iron-smelting furnace. I said at that time, “Obey me and carry out the terms of the covenant exactly as I commanded you. If you do, you will be my people and I will be your God.
19232	24	11	5	Then I will keep the promise I swore on oath to your ancestors to give them a land flowing with milk and honey.” That is the very land that you still live in today.’” And I responded, “Amen! Let it be so, <span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord!</span>”
19233	24	11	6	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Announce all the following words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the terms of my covenant with you and carry them out!
19234	24	11	7	For I solemnly warned your ancestors to obey me. I warned them again and again, ever since I delivered them out of Egypt until this very day.
19235	24	11	8	But they did not listen to me or pay any attention to me! Each one of them followed the stubborn inclinations of his own wicked heart. So I brought on them all the punishments threatened in the covenant because they did not carry out its terms as I commanded them to do.’”
19236	24	11	9	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “The people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem have plotted rebellion against me!
19237	24	11	10	They have gone back to the evil ways of their ancestors of old who refused to obey what I told them. They, too, have paid allegiance to other gods and worshiped them. Both the nation of Israel and the nation of Judah have violated the covenant I made with their ancestors.
19238	24	11	11	So I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say this: ‘I will soon bring disaster on them which they will not be able to escape! When they cry out to me for help, I will not listen to them.
19239	24	11	12	Then those living in the towns of Judah and in Jerusalem will go and cry out for help to the gods to whom they have been sacrificing. However, those gods will by no means be able to save them when disaster strikes them.
19240	24	11	13	This is in spite of the fact that the people of Judah have as many gods as they have towns and the citizens of Jerusalem have set up as many altars to sacrifice to that disgusting god, Baal, as they have streets in the city!’
19241	24	11	14	But as for you, Jeremiah, do not pray for these people. Do not raise a cry of prayer for them. For I will not listen to them when they call out to me for help when disaster strikes them.”
19242	24	11	15	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to the people of Judah, ‡“What right do you have to be in my temple, my beloved people? ‡Many of you have done wicked things. ‡Can your acts of treachery be so easily canceled by sacred offerings ‡that you take joy in doing evil even while you make them?
19243	24	11	16	‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, once called you a thriving olive tree,‡one that produced beautiful fruit.‡But I will set you on fire,‡fire that will blaze with a mighty roar. ‡Then all your branches will be good for nothing.
19244	24	11	17	‡For though I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, planted you in the land, ‡I now decree that disaster will come on you ‡because the nations of Israel and Judah have done evil‡and have made me angry by offering sacrifices to the god Baal.”
19245	24	11	18	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> gave me knowledge, that I might have understanding. ‡Then he showed me what the people were doing.
19246	24	11	19	‡Before this I had been like a docile lamb ready to be led to the slaughter. ‡I did not know they were making plans to kill me. ‡I did not know they were saying, ‡“Let’s destroy the tree along with its fruit! ‡Let’s remove Jeremiah from the world of the living‡so people will not even be reminded of him any more.”
19247	24	11	20	‡So I said, ‡“O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, you are a just judge!‡You examine people’s hearts and minds. ‡I want to see you pay them back for what they have done‡because I trust you to vindicate my cause.”
19248	24	11	21	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me about some men from Anathoth who were threatening to kill me. They had threatened, “Stop prophesying in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> or we will kill you!”
19249	24	11	22	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies said, “I will surely punish them! Their young men will be killed in battle. Their sons and daughters will die of starvation.
19250	24	11	23	Not one of them will survive. I will bring disaster on those men from Anathoth who threatened you. A day of reckoning is coming for them.”
19251	24	12	1	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you have always been fair‡whenever I have complained to you. ‡However, I would like to speak with you about the disposition of justice. ‡Why are wicked people successful? ‡Why do all dishonest people have such easy lives?
19252	24	12	2	‡You plant them like trees and they put down their roots. ‡They grow prosperous and are very fruitful. ‡They always talk about you,‡but they really care nothing about you.
19253	24	12	3	‡But you, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, know all about me.‡You watch me and test my devotion to you. ‡Drag these wicked men away like sheep to be slaughtered!‡Appoint a time when they will be killed!
19254	24	12	4	‡How long must the land be parched ‡and the grass in every field be withered?‡How long must the animals and the birds die‡because of the wickedness of the people who live in this land? ‡For these people boast,‡“God will not see what happens to us.”
19255	24	12	5	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answered, ‡“If you have raced on foot against men and they have worn you out,‡how will you be able to compete with horses?‡And if you feel secure only in safe and open country, ‡how will you manage in the thick undergrowth along the Jordan River?
19256	24	12	6	‡As a matter of fact, even your own brothers ‡and the members of your own family have betrayed you too. ‡Even they have plotted to do away with you. ‡So do not trust them even when they say kind things to you.
19257	24	12	7	‡“I will abandon my nation. ‡I will forsake the people I call my own. ‡I will turn my beloved people ‡over to the power of their enemies.
19258	24	12	8	‡The people I call my own have turned on me‡like a lion in the forest.‡They have roared defiantly at me. ‡So I will treat them as though I hate them.
19259	24	12	9	‡The people I call my own attack me like birds of prey or like hyenas. ‡But other birds of prey are all around them. ‡Let all the nations gather together like wild beasts.‡Let them come and destroy these people I call my own.
19260	24	12	10	‡Many foreign rulers will ruin the land where I planted my people. ‡They will trample all over my chosen land. ‡They will turn my beautiful land‡into a desolate wilderness.
19261	24	12	11	‡They will lay it waste.‡It will lie parched and empty before me.‡The whole land will be laid waste.‡But no one living in it will pay any heed.
19262	24	12	12	‡A destructive army will come marching‡over the hilltops in the wilderness.‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will use them as his destructive weapon ‡against everyone from one end of the land to the other.‡No one will be safe.
19263	24	12	13	‡My people will sow wheat, but will harvest weeds. ‡They will work until they are exhausted, but will get nothing from it.‡They will be disappointed in their harvests ‡because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will take them away in his fierce anger.
19264	24	12	14	¶“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, also have something to say concerning the wicked nations who surround my land and have attacked and plundered the land that I gave to my people as a permanent possession. I say: ‘I will uproot the people of those nations from their land and I will free the people of Judah who have been taken there.
19265	24	12	15	But after I have uprooted the people of those nations, I will relent and have pity on them. I will restore the people of each of those nations to their own lands and to their own country.
19266	24	12	16	But they must make sure to learn to follow the religious practices of my people. Once they taught my people to swear their oaths using the name of the god Baal. But then, they must swear oaths using my name, saying, “As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives, I swear.” If they do these things, then they will be included among the people I call my own.
19267	24	12	17	But I will completely uproot and destroy any of those nations that will not pay heed,’” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19268	24	13	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Go and buy some linen shorts and put them on. Do not put them in water.”
19269	24	13	2	So I bought the shorts in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s instructions and put them on.
19270	24	13	3	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me again,
19271	24	13	4	“Take the shorts that you bought and are wearing and go at once to Perath. Bury the shorts there in a crack in the rocks.”
19272	24	13	5	So I went and buried them at Perath as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had ordered me to do.
19273	24	13	6	Many days later the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Go at once to Perath and get the shorts I ordered you to bury there.”
19274	24	13	7	So I went to Perath and dug up the shorts from the place where I had buried them. I found that they were ruined; they were good for nothing.
19275	24	13	8	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me,
19276	24	13	9	“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: ‘This shows how I will ruin the highly exalted position in which Judah and Jerusalem take pride.
19277	24	13	10	These wicked people refuse to obey what I have said. They follow the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts and pay allegiance to other gods by worshiping and serving them. So they will become just like these linen shorts which are good for nothing.
19278	24	13	11	For,’ I say, ‘just as shorts cling tightly to a person’s body, so I bound the whole nation of Israel and the whole nation of Judah tightly to me.’ I intended for them to be my special people and to bring me fame, honor, and praise. But they would not obey me.
19279	24	13	12	¶“So tell them, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> the God of Israel, says, “Every wine jar is made to be filled with wine.”’ And they will probably say to you, ‘Do you not think we know that every wine jar is supposed to be filled with wine?’
19280	24	13	13	Then tell them, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “I will soon fill all the people who live in this land with stupor. I will also fill the kings from David’s dynasty, the priests, the prophets, and the citizens of Jerusalem with stupor.
19281	24	13	14	And I will smash them like wine bottles against one another, children and parents alike. I will not show any pity, mercy, or compassion. Nothing will keep me from destroying them,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
19282	24	13	15	¶Then I said to the people of Judah, ‡“Listen and pay attention! Do not be arrogant!‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken.
19283	24	13	16	‡Show the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God the respect that is due him. ‡Do it before he brings the darkness of disaster. ‡Do it before you stumble into distress‡like a traveler on the mountains at twilight. ‡Do it before he turns the light of deliverance you hope for‡into the darkness and gloom of exile.
19284	24	13	17	‡But if you will not pay attention to this warning, ‡I will weep alone because of your arrogant pride.‡I will weep bitterly, and my eyes will overflow with tears ‡because you, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s flock, will be carried into exile.”
19285	24	13	18	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me, ‡“Tell the king and the queen mother,‡‘Surrender your thrones, ‡for your glorious crowns‡will be removed from your heads.
19286	24	13	19	‡The gates of the towns in southern Judah will be shut tight. ‡No one will be able to go in or out of them. ‡All Judah will be carried off into exile.‡They will be completely carried off into exile.’”
19287	24	13	20	¶Then I said, ‡“Look up, Jerusalem, and see‡the enemy that is coming from the north.‡Where now is the flock of people that were entrusted to your care? ‡Where now are the ‘sheep’ that you take such pride in?
19288	24	13	21	‡What will you say when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> appoints as rulers over you those allies‡that you, yourself, had actually prepared as such? ‡Then anguish and agony will grip you‡like that of a woman giving birth to a baby.
19289	24	13	22	‡You will probably ask yourself, ‡‘Why have these things happened to me?‡Why have I been treated like a disgraced adulteress‡whose skirt has been torn off and her limbs exposed?’ ‡It is because you have sinned so much.
19290	24	13	23	‡But there is little hope for you ever doing good,‡you who are so accustomed to doing evil.‡Can an Ethiopian change the color of his skin?‡Can a leopard remove its spots?
19291	24	13	24	¶“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‡‘That is why I will scatter your people like chaff‡that is blown away by a desert wind.
19292	24	13	25	‡This is your fate,‡the destiny to which I have appointed you,‡because you have forgotten me‡and have trusted in false gods.
19293	24	13	26	‡So I will pull your skirt up over your face‡and expose you to shame like a disgraced adulteress!
19294	24	13	27	‡People of Jerusalem, I have seen your adulterous worship, ‡your shameless prostitution to, and your lustful pursuit of, other gods. ‡I have seen your disgusting acts of worship ‡on the hills throughout the countryside.‡You are doomed to destruction! ‡How long will you continue to be unclean?’”
19295	24	14	1	¶This was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message to Jeremiah about the drought.
19296	24	14	2	‡“The people of Judah are in mourning.‡The people in her cities are pining away.‡They lie on the ground expressing their sorrow. ‡Cries of distress come up to me from Jerusalem.
19297	24	14	3	‡The leading men of the cities send their servants for water.‡They go to the cisterns, but they do not find any water there.‡They return with their containers empty.‡Disappointed and dismayed, they bury their faces in their hands.
19298	24	14	4	‡They are dismayed because the ground is cracked ‡because there has been no rain in the land.‡The farmers, too, are dismayed‡and bury their faces in their hands.
19299	24	14	5	‡Even the doe abandons her newborn fawn in the field‡because there is no grass.
19300	24	14	6	‡Wild donkeys stand on the hilltops‡and pant for breath like jackals.‡Their eyes are strained looking for food,‡because there is none to be found.”
19301	24	14	7	¶Then I said, ‡“O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, intervene for the honor of your name ‡even though our sins speak out against us. ‡Indeed, we have turned away from you many times.‡We have sinned against you.
19302	24	14	8	‡You have been the object of Israel’s hopes.‡You have saved them when they were in trouble.‡Why have you become like a resident foreigner in the land?‡Why have you become like a traveler who only stops in to spend the night?
19303	24	14	9	‡Why should you be like someone who is helpless, ‡like a champion who cannot save anyone?‡You are indeed with us, ‡and we belong to you. ‡Do not abandon us!”
19304	24	14	10	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke about these people. ‡“They truly love to go astray.‡They cannot keep from running away from me. ‡So I am not pleased with them.‡I will now call to mind the wrongs they have done ‡and punish them for their sins.”
19305	24	14	11	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Do not pray for good to come to these people!
19306	24	14	12	Even if they fast, I will not hear their cries for help. Even if they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will kill them through wars, famines, and plagues.”
19307	24	14	13	¶Then I said, “Oh, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, look! The prophets are telling them that you said, ‘You will not experience war or suffer famine. I will give you lasting peace and prosperity in this land.’”
19308	24	14	14	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Those prophets are prophesying lies while claiming my authority! I did not send them. I did not commission them. I did not speak to them. They are prophesying to these people false visions, worthless predictions, and the delusions of their own mind.
19309	24	14	15	I did not send those prophets, though they claim to be prophesying in my name. They may be saying, ‘No war or famine will happen in this land.’ But I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say this about them: ‘War and starvation will kill those prophets.’
19310	24	14	16	The people to whom they are prophesying will die through war and famine. Their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem and there will be no one to bury them. This will happen to the men and their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out on them the destruction they deserve.”
19311	24	14	17	‡“Tell these people this, Jeremiah: ‡‘My eyes overflow with tears ‡day and night without ceasing. ‡For my people, my dear children, have suffered a crushing blow.‡They have suffered a serious wound.
19312	24	14	18	‡If I go out into the countryside,‡I see those who have been killed in battle.‡If I go into the city,‡I see those who are sick because of starvation. ‡For both prophet and priest–‡they go peddling in the land‡but they are not humbled.’”
19313	24	14	19	¶Then I said,‡“<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have you completely rejected the nation of Judah?‡Do you despise the city of Zion?‡Why have you struck us with such force‡that we are beyond recovery? ‡We hope for peace, but nothing good has come of it.‡We hope for a time of relief from our troubles, but experience terror.
19314	24	14	20	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, we confess that we have been wicked.‡We confess that our ancestors have done wrong. ‡We have indeed sinned against you.
19315	24	14	21	‡For the honor of your name, do not treat Jerusalem with contempt.‡Do not treat with disdain the place where your glorious throne sits. ‡Be mindful of your covenant with us. Do not break it!
19316	24	14	22	‡Do any of the worthless idols of the nations cause rain to fall?‡Do the skies themselves send showers?‡Is it not you, O Lord our God, who does this? ‡So we put our hopes in you ‡because you alone do all this.”
19317	24	15	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me pleading for these people, I would not feel pity for them! Get them away from me! Tell them to go away!
19318	24	15	2	If they ask you, ‘Where should we go?’ tell them the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says this:‡“Those who are destined to die of disease will go to death by disease.‡Those who are destined to die in war will go to death in war.‡Those who are destined to die of starvation will go to death by starvation.‡Those who are destined to go into exile will go into exile.”
19319	24	15	3	¶“I will punish them in four different ways: I will have war kill them. I will have dogs drag off their dead bodies. I will have birds and wild beasts devour and destroy their corpses.
19320	24	15	4	I will make all the people in all the kingdoms of the world horrified at what has happened to them because of what Hezekiah’s son Manasseh, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.”
19321	24	15	5	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> cried out, ‡“Who in the world will have pity on you, Jerusalem?‡Who will grieve over you?‡Who will stop long enough ‡to inquire about how you are doing?
19322	24	15	6	‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: ‘You people have deserted me!‡You keep turning your back on me.’ ‡So I have unleashed my power against you and have begun to destroy you. ‡I have grown tired of feeling sorry for you!”
19323	24	15	7	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> continued, ‡“In every town in the land I will purge them ‡like straw blown away by the wind. ‡I will destroy my people.‡I will kill off their children.‡I will do so because they did not change their behavior.
19324	24	15	8	‡Their widows will become in my sight more numerous ‡than the grains of sand on the seashores.‡At noontime I will bring a destroyer‡against the mothers of their young men. ‡I will cause anguish and terror‡to fall suddenly upon them.
19325	24	15	9	‡The mother who had seven children will grow faint.‡All the breath will go out of her. ‡Her pride and joy will be taken from her in the prime of their life.‡It will seem as if the sun had set while it was still day. ‡She will suffer shame and humiliation. ‡I will cause any of them who are still left alive‡to be killed in war by the onslaughts of their enemies,” ¶says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19326	24	15	10	¶I said, ‡“Oh, mother, how I regret that you ever gave birth to me!‡I am always starting arguments and quarrels with the people of this land. ‡I have not lent money to anyone and I have not borrowed from anyone.‡Yet all of these people are treating me with contempt.”
19327	24	15	11	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‡“Jerusalem, I will surely send you away for your own good.‡I will surely bring the enemy upon you in a time of trouble and distress.
19328	24	15	12	‡Can you people who are like iron and bronze‡break that iron fist from the north?
19329	24	15	13	‡I will give away your wealth and your treasures as plunder.‡I will give it away free of charge for the sins you have committed throughout your land.
19330	24	15	14	‡I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you know nothing about.‡For my anger is like a fire that will burn against you.”
19331	24	15	15	¶I said, ‡“<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you know how I suffer. ‡Take thought of me and care for me.‡Pay back for me those who have been persecuting me.‡Do not be so patient with them that you allow them to kill me.‡Be mindful of how I have put up with their insults for your sake.
19332	24	15	16	‡As your words came to me I drank them in, ‡and they filled my heart with joy and happiness‡because I belong to you, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies.
19333	24	15	17	‡I did not spend my time in the company of other people,‡laughing and having a good time.‡I stayed to myself because I felt obligated to you ‡and because I was filled with anger at what they had done.
19334	24	15	18	‡Why must I continually suffer such painful anguish?‡Why must I endure the sting of their insults like an incurable wound?‡Will you let me down when I need you‡like a brook one goes to for water, but that cannot be relied on?”
19335	24	15	19	¶Because of this, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‡“You must repent of such words and thoughts!‡If you do, I will restore you to the privilege of serving me. ‡If you say what is worthwhile instead of what is worthless,‡I will again allow you to be my spokesman. ‡They must become as you have been.‡You must not become like them.
19336	24	15	20	‡I will make you as strong as a wall to these people,‡a fortified wall of bronze.‡They will attack you,‡but they will not be able to overcome you.‡For I will be with you to rescue you and deliver you,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19337	24	15	21	‡“I will deliver you from the power of the wicked.‡I will free you from the clutches of violent people.”
19338	24	16	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me,
19339	24	16	2	“Do not get married and do not have children here in this land.
19340	24	16	3	For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, tell you what will happen to the children who are born here in this land and to the men and women who are their mothers and fathers.
19341	24	16	4	They will die of deadly diseases. No one will mourn for them. They will not be buried. Their dead bodies will lie like manure spread on the ground. They will be killed in war or die of starvation. Their corpses will be food for the birds and wild animals.
19342	24	16	5	¶“Moreover I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, tell you: ‘Do not go into a house where they are having a funeral meal. Do not go there to mourn and express your sorrow for them. For I have stopped showing them my good favor, my love, and my compassion. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, so affirm it!
19343	24	16	6	Rich and poor alike will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned. People will not cut their bodies or shave off their hair to show their grief for them.
19344	24	16	7	No one will take any food to those who mourn for the dead to comfort them. No one will give them any wine to drink to console them for the loss of their father or mother.
19345	24	16	8	¶“‘Do not go to a house where people are feasting and sit down to eat and drink with them either.
19346	24	16	9	For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, tell you what will happen. I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness, to the glad celebration of brides and grooms in this land. You and the rest of the people will live to see this happen.’”
19347	24	16	10	¶“When you tell these people about all this, they will undoubtedly ask you, ‘Why has the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> threatened us with such great disaster? What wrong have we done? What sin have we done to offend the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God?’
19348	24	16	11	Then tell them that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘It is because your ancestors rejected me and paid allegiance to other gods. They have served them and worshiped them. But they have rejected me and not obeyed my law.
19349	24	16	12	And you have acted even more wickedly than your ancestors! Each one of you has followed the stubborn inclinations of your own wicked heart and not obeyed me.
19350	24	16	13	So I will throw you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have ever known. There you must worship other gods day and night, for I will show you no mercy.’”
19351	24	16	14	¶Yet I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: “A new time will certainly come. People now affirm their oaths with ‘I swear as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives who delivered the people of Israel out of Egypt.’
19352	24	16	15	But in that time they will affirm them with ‘I swear as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives who delivered the people of Israel from the land of the north and from all the other lands where he had banished them.’ At that time I will bring them back to the land I gave their ancestors.”
19353	24	16	16	¶But for now I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: “I will send many enemies who will catch these people like fishermen. After that I will send others who will hunt them out like hunters from all the mountains, all the hills, and the crevices in the rocks.
19354	24	16	17	For I see everything they do. Their wicked ways are not hidden from me. Their sin is not hidden away where I cannot see it.
19355	24	16	18	Before I restore them I will punish them in full for their sins and the wrongs they have done. For they have polluted my land with the lifeless statues of their disgusting idols. They have filled the land I have claimed as my own with their detestable idols.”
19356	24	16	19	¶Then I said, ‡“<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you give me strength and protect me.‡You are the one I can run to for safety when I am in trouble. ‡Nations from all over the earth‡will come to you and say,‡‘Our ancestors had nothing but false gods – ‡worthless idols that could not help them at all.
19357	24	16	20	‡Can people make their own gods?‡No, what they make are not gods at all.”
19358	24	16	21	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, ‡“So I will now let this wicked people know – ‡I will let them know my mighty power in judgment.‡Then they will know that my name is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
19359	24	17	1	‡The sin of Judah is engraved with an iron chisel‡on their stone-hard hearts.‡It is inscribed with a diamond point ‡on the horns of their altars.
19360	24	17	2	‡Their children are always thinking about their altars‡and their sacred poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah, ‡set up beside the green trees on the high hills
19361	24	17	3	‡and on the mountains and in the fields. ‡I will give your wealth and all your treasures away as plunder.‡I will give it away as the price for the sins you have committed throughout your land.
19362	24	17	4	‡You will lose your hold on the land ‡which I gave to you as a permanent possession.‡I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you know nothing about.‡For you have made my anger burn like a fire that will never be put out.”
19363	24	17	5	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“I will put a curse on people ‡who trust in mere human beings,‡who depend on mere flesh and blood for their strength, ‡and whose hearts have turned away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19364	24	17	6	‡They will be like a shrub in the arid rift valley. ‡They will not experience good things even when they happen.‡It will be as though they were growing in the stony wastes in the wilderness, ‡in a salt land where no one can live.
19365	24	17	7	‡My blessing is on those people who trust in me,‡who put their confidence in me.
19366	24	17	8	‡They will be like a tree planted near a stream‡whose roots spread out toward the water.‡It has nothing to fear when the heat comes.‡Its leaves are always green.‡It has no need to be concerned in a year of drought.‡It does not stop bearing fruit.
19367	24	17	9	‡The human mind is more deceitful than anything else.‡It is incurably bad. Who can understand it?
19368	24	17	10	‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, probe into people’s minds.‡I examine people’s hearts. ‡I deal with each person according to how he has behaved.‡I give them what they deserve based on what they have done.
19369	24	17	11	‡The person who gathers wealth by unjust means‡is like the partridge that broods over eggs but does not hatch them. ‡Before his life is half over he will lose his ill-gotten gains. ‡At the end of his life it will be clear he was a fool.”
19370	24	17	12	¶Then I said, ‡“<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, from the very beginning ‡you have been seated on your glorious throne on high.‡You are the place where we can find refuge.
19371	24	17	13	‡You are the one in whom Israel may find hope. ‡All who leave you will suffer shame.‡Those who turn away from you will be consigned to the netherworld. ‡For they have rejected you, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the fountain of life.
19372	24	17	14	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, grant me relief from my suffering‡so that I may have some relief;‡rescue me from those who persecute me‡so that I may be rescued, for you give me reason to praise!
19373	24	17	15	‡Look at what they are saying to me, ‡“Where are the events in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message?‡Let’s see them happen, please!”
19374	24	17	16	‡But I have not pestered you to bring disaster. ‡I have not desired the time of irreparable devastation. ‡You know that.‡You are fully aware of every word that I have spoken.
19375	24	17	17	‡Do not cause me dismay! ‡You are my source of safety in times of trouble.
19376	24	17	18	‡May those who persecute me be disgraced.‡Do not let me be disgraced.‡May they be dismayed.‡Do not let me be dismayed.‡Bring days of disaster on them.‡Bring on them the destruction they deserve.”
19377	24	17	19	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me, “Go and stand in the People’s Gate through which the kings of Judah enter and leave the city. Then go and stand in all the other gates of the city of Jerusalem.
19378	24	17	20	And then announce to them, ‘Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message, you kings of Judah, and everyone from Judah, and all you citizens of Jerusalem, those who pass through these gates.
19379	24	17	21	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘Be very careful if you value your lives! Do not carry any loads in through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.
19380	24	17	22	Do not carry any loads out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath day. But observe the Sabbath day as a day set apart to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> as I commanded your ancestors.
19381	24	17	23	Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay any attention to me. They stubbornly refused to pay attention or to respond to any discipline.’
19382	24	17	24	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘You must make sure to obey me. You must not bring any loads through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day. You must set the Sabbath day apart to me. You must not do any work on that day.
19383	24	17	25	If you do this, then the kings and princes who follow in David’s succession and ride in chariots or on horses will continue to enter through these gates, as well as their officials and the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem. This city will always be filled with people.
19384	24	17	26	Then people will come here from the towns in Judah, from the villages surrounding Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin, from the foothills, from the southern hill country, and from the southern part of Judah. They will come bringing offerings to the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings, and incense along with their thank offerings.
19385	24	17	27	But you must obey me and set the Sabbath day apart to me. You must not carry any loads in through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. If you disobey, I will set the gates of Jerusalem on fire. It will burn down all the fortified dwellings in Jerusalem and no one will be able to put it out.’”
19386	24	18	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Jeremiah:
19387	24	18	2	“Go down at once to the potter’s house. I will speak to you further there.”
19388	24	18	3	So I went down to the potter’s house and found him working at his wheel.
19389	24	18	4	Now and then there would be something wrong with the pot he was molding from the clay with his hands. So he would rework the clay into another kind of pot as he saw fit.
19390	24	18	5	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me,
19391	24	18	6	“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: ‘O nation of Israel, can I not deal with you as this potter deals with the clay? In my hands, you, O nation of Israel, are just like the clay in this potter’s hand.’
19392	24	18	7	There are times, Jeremiah, when I threaten to uproot, tear down, and destroy a nation or kingdom.
19393	24	18	8	But if that nation I threatened stops doing wrong, I will cancel the destruction I intended to do to it.
19394	24	18	9	And there are times when I promise to build up and establish a nation or kingdom.
19395	24	18	10	But if that nation does what displeases me and does not obey me, then I will cancel the good I promised to do to it.
19396	24	18	11	So now, tell the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem this: The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘I am preparing to bring disaster on you! I am making plans to punish you. So, every one of you, stop the evil things you have been doing. Correct the way you have been living and do what is right.’
19397	24	18	12	But they just keep saying, ‘We do not care what you say! We will do whatever we want to do! We will continue to behave wickedly and stubbornly!’”
19398	24	18	13	¶Therefore, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“Ask the people of other nations‡whether they have heard of anything like this.‡Israel should have been like a virgin.‡But she has done something utterly revolting!
19399	24	18	14	‡Does the snow ever completely vanish from the rocky slopes of Lebanon?‡Do the cool waters from those distant mountains ever cease to flow?
19400	24	18	15	‡Yet my people have forgotten me‡and offered sacrifices to worthless idols!‡This makes them stumble along in the way they live‡and leave the old reliable path of their fathers. ‡They have left them to walk in bypaths,‡in roads that are not smooth and level.
19401	24	18	16	‡So their land will become an object of horror. ‡People will forever hiss out their scorn over it.‡All who pass that way will be filled with horror‡and will shake their heads in derision.
19402	24	18	17	‡I will scatter them before their enemies‡like dust blowing in front of a burning east wind.‡I will turn my back on them and not look favorably on them ‡when disaster strikes them.”
19403	24	18	18	¶Then some people said, “Come on! Let us consider how to deal with Jeremiah! There will still be priests to instruct us, wise men to give us advice, and prophets to declare God’s word. Come on! Let’s bring charges against him and get rid of him! Then we will not need to pay attention to anything he says.”
19404	24	18	19	¶Then I said, ‡“<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, pay attention to me.‡Listen to what my enemies are saying.
19405	24	18	20	‡Should good be paid back with evil?‡Yet they are virtually digging a pit to kill me. ‡Just remember how I stood before you‡pleading on their behalf ‡to keep you from venting your anger on them.
19406	24	18	21	‡So let their children die of starvation.‡Let them be cut down by the sword. ‡Let their wives lose their husbands and children.‡Let the older men die of disease ‡and the younger men die by the sword in battle.
19407	24	18	22	‡Let cries of terror be heard in their houses‡when you send bands of raiders unexpectedly to plunder them. ‡For they have virtually dug a pit to capture me‡and have hidden traps for me to step into.
19408	24	18	23	‡But you, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, know‡all their plots to kill me.‡Do not pardon their crimes!‡Do not ignore their sins as though you had erased them! ‡Let them be brought down in defeat before you!‡Deal with them while you are still angry!
19409	24	19	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Jeremiah, “Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take with you some of the leaders of the people and some of the leaders of the priests.
19410	24	19	2	Go out to the part of the Hinnom Valley which is near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. Announce there what I tell you.
19411	24	19	3	Say, ‘Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message, you kings of Judah and citizens of Jerusalem! This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, has said, “Look here. I am about to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it ring!
19412	24	19	4	I will do so because these people have rejected me and have defiled this place. They have offered sacrifices in it to other gods which neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah knew anything about. They have filled it with the blood of innocent children.
19413	24	19	5	They have built places here for worship of the god Baal so that they could sacrifice their children as burnt offerings to him in the fire. Such sacrifices are something I never commanded them to make! They are something I never told them to do! Indeed, such a thing never even entered my mind!
19414	24	19	6	So I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: “The time will soon come that people will no longer call this place Topheth or the Hinnom Valley. But they will call this valley the Valley of Slaughter!
19415	24	19	7	In this place I will thwart the plans of the people of Judah and Jerusalem. I will deliver them over to the power of their enemies who are seeking to kill them. They will die by the sword at the hands of their enemies. I will make their dead bodies food for the birds and wild beasts to eat.
19416	24	19	8	I will make this city an object of horror, a thing to be hissed at. All who pass by it will be filled with horror and will hiss out their scorn because of all the disasters that have happened to it.
19417	24	19	9	I will reduce the people of this city to desperate straits during the siege imposed on it by their enemies who are seeking to kill them. I will make them so desperate that they will eat the flesh of their own sons and daughters and the flesh of one another.”’”
19418	24	19	10	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> continued, “Now break the jar in front of those who have come here with you.
19419	24	19	11	Tell them the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘I will do just as Jeremiah has done. I will smash this nation and this city as though it were a potter’s vessel which is broken beyond repair. The dead will be buried here in Topheth until there is no more room to bury them.’
19420	24	19	12	I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: ‘That is how I will deal with this city and its citizens. I will make it like Topheth.
19421	24	19	13	The houses in Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled by dead bodies just like this place, Topheth. For they offered sacrifice to the stars and poured out drink offerings to other gods on the roofs of those houses.’”
19422	24	19	14	¶Then Jeremiah left Topheth where the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had sent him to give that prophecy. He went to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and stood in its courtyard and called out to all the people.
19423	24	19	15	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘I will soon bring on this city and all the towns surrounding it all the disaster I threatened to do to it. I will do so because they have stubbornly refused to pay any attention to what I have said!’”
19424	24	20	1	¶Now Pashhur son of Immer heard Jeremiah prophesy these things. He was the priest who was chief of security in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
19425	24	20	2	When he heard Jeremiah’s prophecy, he had the prophet flogged. Then he put him in the stocks which were at the Upper Gate of Benjamin in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
19426	24	20	3	But the next day Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks. When he did, Jeremiah said to him, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s name for you is not ‘Pashhur’ but ‘Terror is Everywhere.’
19427	24	20	4	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘I will make both you and your friends terrified of what will happen to you. You will see all of them die by the swords of their enemies. I will hand all the people of Judah over to the king of Babylon. He will carry some of them away into exile in Babylon and he will kill others of them with the sword.
19428	24	20	5	I will hand over all the wealth of this city to their enemies. I will hand over to them all the fruits of the labor of the people of this city and all their prized possessions, as well as all the treasures of the kings of Judah. Their enemies will seize it all as plunder and carry it off to Babylon.
19429	24	20	6	You, Pashhur, and all your household will go into exile in Babylon. You will die there and you will be buried there. The same thing will happen to all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.’”
19430	24	20	7	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you coerced me into being a prophet, ‡and I allowed you to do it.‡You overcame my resistance and prevailed over me. ‡Now I have become a constant laughingstock.‡Everyone ridicules me.
19431	24	20	8	‡For whenever I prophesy, I must cry out, ‡“Violence and destruction are coming!” ‡This message from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has made me‡an object of continual insults and derision.
19432	24	20	9	‡Sometimes I think, “I will make no mention of his message.‡I will not speak as his messenger any more.”‡But then his message becomes like a fire‡locked up inside of me, burning in my heart and soul. ‡I grow weary of trying to hold it in;‡I cannot contain it.
19433	24	20	10	‡I hear many whispering words of intrigue against me.‡Those who would cause me terror are everywhere! ‡They are saying, “Come on, let’s publicly denounce him!” ‡All my so-called friends are just watching for ‡something that would lead to my downfall. ‡They say, “Perhaps he can be enticed into slipping up,‡so we can prevail over him and get our revenge on him.
19434	24	20	11	‡But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is with me to help me like an awe-inspiring warrior. ‡Therefore those who persecute me will fail and will not prevail over me.‡They will be thoroughly disgraced because they did not succeed.‡Their disgrace will never be forgotten.
19435	24	20	12	‡O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, you test and prove the righteous.‡You see into people’s hearts and minds. ‡Pay them back for what they have done‡because I trust you to vindicate my cause.
19436	24	20	13	‡Sing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! Praise the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!‡For he rescues the oppressed from the clutches of evildoers.
19437	24	20	14	‡Cursed be the day I was born!‡May that day not be blessed when my mother gave birth to me.
19438	24	20	15	‡Cursed be the man‡who made my father very glad‡when he brought him the news‡that a baby boy had been born to him!
19439	24	20	16	‡May that man be like the cities ‡that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> destroyed without showing any mercy.‡May he hear a cry of distress in the morning‡and a battle cry at noon.
19440	24	20	17	‡For he did not kill me before I came from the womb,‡making my pregnant mother’s womb my grave forever.
19441	24	20	18	‡Why did I ever come forth from my mother’s womb?‡All I experience is trouble and grief,‡and I spend my days in shame.
19442	24	21	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. Zedekiah sent them to Jeremiah to ask,
19443	24	21	2	“Please ask the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to come and help us, because King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon is attacking us. Maybe the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will perform one of his miracles as in times past and make him stop attacking us and leave.”
19444	24	21	3	Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah
19445	24	21	4	that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> the God of Israel, says, ‘The forces at your disposal are now outside the walls fighting against King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the Babylonians who have you under siege. I will gather those forces back inside the city.
19446	24	21	5	In anger, in fury, and in wrath I myself will fight against you with my mighty power and great strength!
19447	24	21	6	I will kill everything living in Jerusalem, people and animals alike! They will die from terrible diseases.
19448	24	21	7	Then I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, promise that I will hand over King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, and any of the people who survive the war, starvation, and disease. I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and to their enemies who want to kill them. He will slaughter them with the sword. He will not show them any mercy, compassion, or pity.’
19449	24	21	8	¶“But tell the people of Jerusalem that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘I will give you a choice between two courses of action. One will result in life; the other will result in death.
19450	24	21	9	Those who stay in this city will die in battle or of starvation or disease. Those who leave the city and surrender to the Babylonians who are besieging it will live. They will escape with their lives.
19451	24	21	10	For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say that I am determined not to deliver this city but to bring disaster on it. It will be handed over to the king of Babylon and he will destroy it with fire.’”
19452	24	21	11	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me to say to the royal court of Judah, ‡“Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message,
19453	24	21	12	‡O royal family descended from David. ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡‘See to it that people each day are judged fairly. ‡Deliver those who have been robbed from those who oppress them.‡Otherwise, my wrath will blaze out against you.‡It will burn like a fire that cannot be put out‡because of the evil that you have done.
19454	24	21	13	‡Listen, you who sit enthroned above the valley on a rocky plateau.‡I am opposed to you,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‡‘You boast, “No one can swoop down on us.‡No one can penetrate into our places of refuge.”
19455	24	21	14	‡But I will punish you as your deeds deserve,’‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‡‘I will set fire to your palace;‡it will burn up everything around it.’”
19456	24	22	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me, “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah. Give him a message from me there.
19457	24	22	2	Say: ‘Listen, O king of Judah who follows in David’s succession. You, your officials, and your subjects who pass through the gates of this palace must listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message.
19458	24	22	3	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “Do what is just and right. Deliver those who have been robbed from those who oppress them. Do not exploit or mistreat resident foreigners who live in your land, children who have no fathers, or widows. Do not kill innocent people in this land.
19459	24	22	4	If you are careful to obey these commands, then the kings who follow in David’s succession and ride in chariots or on horses will continue to come through the gates of this palace, as will their officials and their subjects.
19460	24	22	5	But, if you do not obey these commands, I solemnly swear that this palace will become a pile of rubble. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!”
19461	24	22	6	‡“‘For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says concerning the palace of the king of Judah,‡“This place looks like a veritable forest of Gilead to me.‡It is like the wooded heights of Lebanon in my eyes.‡But I swear that I will make it like a wilderness‡whose towns have all been deserted.
19462	24	22	7	‡I will send men against it to destroy it ‡with their axes and hatchets.‡They will hack up its fine cedar panels and columns‡and throw them into the fire.
19463	24	22	8	¶“‘People from other nations will pass by this city. They will ask one another, “Why has the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> done such a thing to this great city?”
19464	24	22	9	The answer will come back, “It is because they broke their covenant with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God and worshiped and served other gods.”
19465	24	22	10	‡“‘Do not weep for the king who was killed.‡Do not grieve for him.‡But weep mournfully for the king who has gone into exile.‡For he will never return to see his native land again.
19466	24	22	11	¶“‘For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken about Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but was carried off into exile. He has said, “He will never return to this land.
19467	24	22	12	For he will die in the country where they took him as a captive. He will never see this land again.”
19468	24	22	13	‡“‘Sure to be judged is the king who builds his palace using injustice‡and treats people unfairly while adding its upper rooms. ‡He makes his countrymen work for him for nothing.‡He does not pay them for their labor.
19469	24	22	14	‡He says, “I will build myself a large palace‡with spacious upper rooms.”‡He cuts windows in its walls,‡panels it with cedar, and paints its rooms red.
19470	24	22	15	‡Does it make you any more of a king‡that you outstrip everyone else in building with cedar?‡Just think about your father.‡He was content that he had food and drink. ‡He did what was just and right. ‡So things went well with him.
19471	24	22	16	‡He upheld the cause of the poor and needy.‡So things went well for Judah.’ ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡‘That is a good example of what it means to know me.’
19472	24	22	17	‡But you are always thinking and looking‡for ways to increase your wealth by dishonest means.‡Your eyes and your heart are set ‡on killing some innocent person ‡and committing fraud and oppression.
19473	24	22	18	‡So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has this to say about Josiah’s son, King Jehoiakim of Judah:‡People will not mourn for him, saying,‡“This makes me sad, my brother! ‡This makes me sad, my sister!”‡They will not mourn for him, saying,‡“Poor, poor lord! Poor, poor majesty!”
19474	24	22	19	‡He will be left unburied just like a dead donkey.‡His body will be dragged off and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.’”
19475	24	22	20	‡People of Jerusalem, go up to Lebanon and cry out in mourning.‡Go to the land of Bashan and cry out loudly.‡Cry out in mourning from the mountains of Moab. ‡For your allies have all been defeated.
19476	24	22	21	‡While you were feeling secure I gave you warning. ‡But you said, “I refuse to listen to you.”‡That is the way you have acted from your earliest history onward. ‡Indeed, you have never paid attention to me.
19477	24	22	22	‡My judgment will carry off all your leaders like a storm wind! ‡Your allies will go into captivity.‡Then you will certainly be disgraced and put to shame‡because of all the wickedness you have done.
19478	24	22	23	‡You may feel as secure as a bird‡nesting in the cedars of Lebanon.‡But oh how you will groan when the pains of judgment come on you.‡They will be like those of a woman giving birth to a baby.
19479	24	22	24	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ¶“As surely as I am the living God, you, Jeconiah, king of Judah, son of Jehoiakim, will not be the earthly representative of my authority. Indeed, I will take that right away from you.
19480	24	22	25	I will hand you over to those who want to take your life and of whom you are afraid. I will hand you over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his Babylonian soldiers.
19481	24	22	26	I will force you and your mother who gave you birth into exile. You will be exiled to a country where neither of you were born, and you will both die there.
19482	24	22	27	You will never come back to this land to which you will long to return!”
19483	24	22	28	‡This man, Jeconiah, will be like a broken pot someone threw away.‡He will be like a clay vessel that no one wants. ‡Why will he and his children be forced into exile?‡Why will they be thrown out into a country they know nothing about?
19484	24	22	29	‡O land of Judah, land of Judah, land of Judah! ‡Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message!
19485	24	22	30	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“Enroll this man in the register as though he were childless. ‡Enroll him as a man who will not enjoy success during his lifetime.‡For none of his sons will succeed in occupying the throne of David‡or ever succeed in ruling over Judah.”
19486	24	23	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “The leaders of my people are sure to be judged. They were supposed to watch over my people like shepherds watch over their sheep. But they are causing my people to be destroyed and scattered.
19487	24	23	2	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has this to say about the leaders who are ruling over his people: “You have caused my people to be dispersed and driven into exile. You have not taken care of them. So I will punish you for the evil that you have done. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!
19488	24	23	3	Then I myself will regather those of my people who are still alive from all the countries where I have driven them. I will bring them back to their homeland. They will greatly increase in number.
19489	24	23	4	I will install rulers over them who will care for them. Then they will no longer need to fear or be terrified. None of them will turn up missing. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, promise it!
19490	24	23	5	‡“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, promise that a new time will certainly come ‡when I will raise up for them a righteous branch, a descendant of David.‡He will rule over them with wisdom and understanding ‡and will do what is just and right in the land.
19491	24	23	6	‡Under his rule Judah will enjoy safety ‡and Israel will live in security. ‡This is the name he will go by:‡‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has provided us with justice.’
19492	24	23	7	¶“So I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: ‘A new time will certainly come. People now affirm their oaths with “I swear as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives who delivered the people of Israel out of Egypt.”
19493	24	23	8	But at that time they will affirm them with “I swear as surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives who delivered the descendants of the former nation of Israel from the land of the north and from all the other lands where he had banished them.” At that time they will live in their own land.’”
19494	24	23	9	‡Here is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says concerning the false prophets: ‡My heart and my mind are deeply disturbed.‡I tremble all over. ‡I am like a drunk person,‡like a person who has had too much wine, ‡because of the way the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡and his holy word are being mistreated.
19495	24	23	10	‡For the land is full of people unfaithful to him. ‡They live wicked lives and they misuse their power. ‡So the land is dried up because it is under his curse. ‡The pastures in the wilderness are withered.
19496	24	23	11	‡Moreover, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‡“Both the prophets and priests are godless.‡I have even found them doing evil in my temple!
19497	24	23	12	‡So the paths they follow will be dark and slippery.‡They will stumble and fall headlong.‡For I will bring disaster on them.‡A day of reckoning is coming for them.” ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> affirms it!
19498	24	23	13	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “I saw the prophets of Samaria ‡doing something that was disgusting. ‡They prophesied in the name of the god Baal‡and led my people Israel astray.
19499	24	23	14	‡But I see the prophets of Jerusalem ‡doing something just as shocking.‡They are unfaithful to me ‡and continually prophesy lies. ‡So they give encouragement to people who are doing evil,‡with the result that they do not stop their evildoing. ‡I consider all of them as bad as the people of Sodom,‡and the citizens of Jerusalem as bad as the people of Gomorrah.
19500	24	23	15	‡So then I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‡have something to say concerning the prophets of Jerusalem: ‡‘I will make these prophets eat the bitter food of suffering ‡and drink the poison water of judgment. ‡For the prophets of Jerusalem are the reason ‡that ungodliness has spread throughout the land.’”
19501	24	23	16	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says to the people of Jerusalem: ‡“Do not listen to what‡those prophets are saying to you.‡They are filling you with false hopes.‡They are reporting visions of their own imaginations,‡not something the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has given them to say.
19502	24	23	17	‡They continually say to those who reject what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‡‘Things will go well for you!’ ‡They say to all those who follow the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts,‡‘Nothing bad will happen to you!’
19503	24	23	18	‡Yet which of them has ever stood in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s inner circle ‡so they could see and hear what he has to say? ‡Which of them have ever paid attention or listened to what he has said?
19504	24	23	19	‡But just watch! The wrath of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡will come like a storm! ‡Like a raging storm it will rage down ‡on the heads of those who are wicked.
19505	24	23	20	‡The anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will not turn back‡until he has fully carried out his intended purposes. ‡In days to come ‡you people will come to understand this clearly.
19506	24	23	21	‡I did not send those prophets.‡Yet they were in a hurry to give their message. ‡I did not tell them anything.‡Yet they prophesied anyway.
19507	24	23	22	‡But if they had stood in my inner circle, ‡they would have proclaimed my message to my people.‡They would have caused my people to turn from their wicked ways‡and stop doing the evil things they are doing.
19508	24	23	23	‡Do you people think that I am some local deity‡and not the transcendent God?” the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> asks.
19509	24	23	24	‡“Do you really think anyone can hide himself‡where I cannot see him?” the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> asks. ‡“Do you not know that I am everywhere?” ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> asks.
19510	24	23	25	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “I have heard what those prophets who are prophesying lies in my name are saying. They are saying, ‘I have had a dream! I have had a dream!’
19511	24	23	26	Those prophets are just prophesying lies. They are prophesying the delusions of their own minds.
19512	24	23	27	How long will they go on plotting to make my people forget who I am through the dreams they tell one another? That is just as bad as what their ancestors did when they forgot who I am by worshiping the god Baal.
19513	24	23	28	Let the prophet who has had a dream go ahead and tell his dream. Let the person who has received my message report that message faithfully. What is like straw cannot compare to what is like grain! I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!
19514	24	23	29	My message is like a fire that purges dross! It is like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces! I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, so affirm it!
19515	24	23	30	So I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that I am opposed to those prophets who steal messages from one another that they claim are from me.
19516	24	23	31	I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> affirm that I am opposed to those prophets who are using their own tongues to declare, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> declares….’
19517	24	23	32	I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that I am opposed to those prophets who dream up lies and report them. They are misleading my people with their reckless lies. I did not send them. I did not commission them. They are not helping these people at all. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!”
19518	24	23	33	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Jeremiah, when one of these people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, ‘What burdensome message do you have from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?’Tell them, ‘You are the burden, and I will cast you away. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!
19519	24	23	34	I will punish any prophet, priest, or other person who says “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message is burdensome.” I will punish both that person and his whole family.’”
19520	24	23	35	¶So I, Jeremiah, tell you, “Each of you people should say to his friend or his relative, ‘How did the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> answer? Or what did the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> say?’
19521	24	23	36	You must no longer say that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message is burdensome. For what is ‘burdensome’ really pertains to what a person himself says. You are misrepresenting the words of our God, the living God, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
19522	24	23	37	Each of you should merely ask the prophet, ‘What answer did the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> give you? Or what did the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> say?’
19523	24	23	38	But just suppose you continue to say, ‘The message of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is burdensome.’ Here is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says will happen: ‘I sent word to you that you must not say, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message is burdensome.” But you used the words “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message is burdensome” anyway.
19524	24	23	39	So I will carry you far off and throw you away. I will send both you and the city I gave to you and to your ancestors out of my sight.
19525	24	23	40	I will bring on you lasting shame and lasting disgrace which will never be forgotten!’”
19526	24	24	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> showed me two baskets of figs sitting before his temple. This happened after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon deported Jehoiakim’s son, King Jeconiah of Judah. He deported him and the leaders of Judah from Jerusalem, along with the craftsmen and metal workers, and took them to Babylon.
19527	24	24	2	One basket had very good-looking figs in it. They looked like those that had ripened early. The other basket had very bad-looking figs in it, so bad they could not be eaten.
19528	24	24	3	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I answered, “I see figs. The good ones look very good. But the bad ones look very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”
19529	24	24	4	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me,
19530	24	24	5	“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> the God of Israel, say: ‘The exiles of Judah whom I sent away from here to the land of Babylon are like those good figs. I consider them to be good.
19531	24	24	6	I will look after their welfare and will restore them to this land. There I will build them up and will not tear them down. I will plant them firmly in the land and will not uproot them.
19532	24	24	7	I will give them the desire to acknowledge that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. I will be their God and they will be my people. For they will wholeheartedly return to me.’
19533	24	24	8	¶“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, also solemnly assert: ‘King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, and the people who remain in Jerusalem or who have gone to live in Egypt are like those bad figs. I consider them to be just like those bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten.
19534	24	24	9	I will bring such disaster on them that all the kingdoms of the earth will be horrified. I will make them an object of reproach, a proverbial example of disaster. I will make them an object of ridicule, an example to be used in curses. That is how they will be remembered wherever I banish them.
19535	24	24	10	I will bring war, starvation, and disease on them until they are completely destroyed from the land I gave them and their ancestors.’”
19536	24	25	1	¶In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah. (That was the same as the first year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon.)
19537	24	25	2	So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the people who were living in Jerusalem.
19538	24	25	3	“For the last twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was ruling in Judah until now, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s messages have come to me and I have told them to you over and over again. But you would not listen.
19539	24	25	4	Over and over again the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent his servants the prophets to you. But you have not listened or paid attention.
19540	24	25	5	He said through them, ‘Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and stop doing the evil things you are doing. If you do, I will allow you to continue to live here in the land that I gave to you and your ancestors as a lasting possession.
19541	24	25	6	Do not pay allegiance to other gods and worship and serve them. Do not make me angry by the things that you do. Then I will not cause you any harm.’
19542	24	25	7	So, now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘You have not listened to me. But you have made me angry by the things that you have done. Thus you have brought harm on yourselves.’
19543	24	25	8	¶“Therefore, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘You have not listened to what I said.
19544	24	25	9	So I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that I will send for all the peoples of the north and my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and all the nations that surround it. I will utterly destroy this land, its inhabitants, and all the nations that surround it and make them everlasting ruins. I will make them objects of horror and hissing scorn.
19545	24	25	10	I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness, to the glad celebration of brides and grooms in these lands. I will put an end to the sound of people grinding meal. I will put an end to lamps shining in their houses.
19546	24	25	11	This whole area will become a desolate wasteland. These nations will be subject to the king of Babylon for seventy years.’
19547	24	25	12	¶“‘But when the seventy years are over, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation for their sins. I will make the land of Babylon an everlasting ruin. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!
19548	24	25	13	I will bring on that land everything that I said I would. I will bring on it everything that is written in this book. I will bring on it everything that Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
19549	24	25	14	For many nations and great kings will make slaves of the king of Babylon and his nation too. I will repay them for all they have done!’”
19550	24	25	15	¶So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> the God of Israel, spoke to me in a vision. “Take this cup from my hand. It is filled with the wine of my wrath. Take it and make the nations to whom I send you drink it.
19551	24	25	16	When they have drunk it, they will stagger to and fro and act insane. For I will send wars sweeping through them.”
19552	24	25	17	¶So I took the cup from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s hand. I made all the nations to whom he sent me drink the wine of his wrath.
19553	24	25	18	I made Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and its officials drink it. I did it so Judah would become a ruin. I did it so Judah, its kings, and its officials would become an object of horror and of hissing scorn, an example used in curses. Such is already becoming the case!
19554	24	25	19	I made all of these other people drink it: Pharaoh, king of Egypt; his attendants, his officials, his people,
19555	24	25	20	the foreigners living in Egypt; all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the land of the Philistines, the people of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, the people who had been left alive from Ashdod;
19556	24	25	21	all the people of Edom, Moab, Ammon;
19557	24	25	22	all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon; all the kings of the coastlands along the sea;
19558	24	25	23	the people of Dedan, Tema, Buz, all the desert people who cut their hair short at the temples;
19559	24	25	24	all the kings of Arabia who live in the desert;
19560	24	25	25	all the kings of Zimri; all the kings of Elam; all the kings of Media;
19561	24	25	26	all the kings of the north, whether near or far from one another; and all the other kingdoms which are on the face of the earth. After all of them have drunk the wine of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s wrath, the king of Babylon must drink it.
19562	24	25	27	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Tell them that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘Drink this cup until you get drunk and vomit. Drink until you fall down and can’t get up. For I will send wars sweeping through you.’
19563	24	25	28	If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink it, tell them that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says ‘You most certainly must drink it!
19564	24	25	29	For take note, I am already beginning to bring disaster on the city that I call my own. So how can you possibly avoid being punished? You will not go unpunished! For I am proclaiming war against all who live on the earth. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, affirm it!’
19565	24	25	30	¶“Then, Jeremiah, make the following prophecy against them: ‡‘Like a lion about to attack, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will roar from the heights of heaven;‡from his holy dwelling on high he will roar loudly.‡He will roar mightily against his land. ‡He will shout in triumph like those stomping juice from the grapes ‡against all those who live on the earth.
19566	24	25	31	‡The sounds of battle will resound to the ends of the earth.‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will bring charges against the nations. ‡He will pass judgment on all humankind‡and will hand the wicked over to be killed in war.’ ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> so affirms it!
19567	24	25	32	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says,‡‘Disaster will soon come on one nation after another. ‡A mighty storm of military destruction is rising up‡from the distant parts of the earth.’
19568	24	25	33	‡Those who have been killed by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at that time ‡will be scattered from one end of the earth to the other. ‡They will not be mourned over, gathered up, or buried. ‡Their dead bodies will lie scattered over the ground like manure.
19569	24	25	34	‡Wail and cry out in anguish, you rulers!‡Roll in the dust, you who shepherd flocks of people! ‡The time for you to be slaughtered has come.‡You will lie scattered and fallen like broken pieces of fine pottery.
19570	24	25	35	‡The leaders will not be able to run away and hide. ‡The shepherds of the flocks will not be able to escape.
19571	24	25	36	‡Listen to the cries of anguish of the leaders.‡Listen to the wails of the shepherds of the flocks.‡They are wailing because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡is about to destroy their lands.
19572	24	25	37	‡Their peaceful dwelling places will be laid waste ‡by the fierce anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19573	24	25	38	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is like a lion who has left his lair. ‡So their lands will certainly be laid waste‡by the warfare of the oppressive nation ‡and by the fierce anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
19574	24	26	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah at the beginning of the reign of Josiah’s son, King Jehoiakim of Judah.
19575	24	26	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Go stand in the courtyard of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. Speak out to all the people who are coming from the towns of Judah to worship in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. Tell them everything I command you to tell them. Do not leave out a single word!
19576	24	26	3	Maybe they will pay attention and each of them will stop living the evil way they do. If they do that, then I will forgo destroying them as I had intended to do because of the wicked things they have been doing.
19577	24	26	4	Tell them that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘You must obey me! You must live according to the way I have instructed you in my laws.
19578	24	26	5	You must pay attention to the exhortations of my servants the prophets. I have sent them to you over and over again. But you have not paid any attention to them.
19579	24	26	6	If you do not obey me, then I will do to this temple what I did to Shiloh. And I will make this city an example to be used in curses by people from all the nations on the earth.’”
19580	24	26	7	¶The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah say these things in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
19581	24	26	8	Jeremiah had just barely finished saying all the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had commanded him to say to all the people. All at once some of the priests, the prophets, and the people grabbed him and shouted, “You deserve to die!
19582	24	26	9	How dare you claim the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s authority to prophesy such things! How dare you claim his authority to prophesy that this temple will become like Shiloh and that this city will become an uninhabited ruin!” Then all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
19583	24	26	10	¶However, some of the officials of Judah heard about what was happening and they rushed up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple from the royal palace. They set up court at the entrance of the New Gate of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
19584	24	26	11	Then the priests and the prophets made their charges before the officials and all the people. They said, “This man should be condemned to die because he prophesied against this city. You have heard him do so with your own ears.”
19585	24	26	12	¶Then Jeremiah made his defense before all the officials and all the people. “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent me to prophesy everything you have heard me say against this temple and against this city.
19586	24	26	13	But correct the way you have been living and do what is right. Obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God. If you do, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will forgo destroying you as he threatened he would.
19587	24	26	14	As to my case, I am in your power. Do to me what you deem fair and proper.
19588	24	26	15	But you should take careful note of this: If you put me to death, you will bring on yourselves and this city and those who live in it the guilt of murdering an innocent man. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent me to speak all this where you can hear it. That is the truth!”
19589	24	26	16	¶Then the officials and all the people rendered their verdict to the priests and the prophets. They said, “This man should not be condemned to die. For he has spoken to us under the authority of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.”
19590	24	26	17	Then some of the elders of Judah stepped forward and spoke to all the people gathered there. They said,
19591	24	26	18	“Micah from Moresheth prophesied during the time Hezekiah was king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah,‡‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says,‡“Zion will become a plowed field.‡Jerusalem will become a pile of rubble.‡The temple mount will become a mere wooded ridge.”’
19592	24	26	19	¶King Hezekiah and all the people of Judah did not put him to death, did they? Did not Hezekiah show reverence for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s favor? Did not the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> forgo destroying them as he threatened he would? But we are on the verge of bringing great disaster on ourselves.”
19593	24	26	20	¶Now there was another man who prophesied as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s representative against this city and this land just as Jeremiah did. His name was Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim.
19594	24	26	21	When King Jehoiakim and all his bodyguards and officials heard what he was prophesying, the king sought to have him executed. But Uriah found out about it and fled to Egypt out of fear.
19595	24	26	22	However, King Jehoiakim sent some men to Egypt, including Elnathan son of Achbor,
19596	24	26	23	and they brought Uriah back from there. They took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him executed and had his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.
19597	24	26	24	¶However, Ahikam son of Shaphan used his influence to keep Jeremiah from being handed over and executed by the people.
19598	24	27	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah early in the reign of Josiah’s son, King Zedekiah of Judah.
19599	24	27	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told me, “Make a yoke out of leather straps and wooden crossbars and put it on your neck.
19600	24	27	3	Use it to send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon. Send them through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to King Zedekiah of Judah.
19601	24	27	4	Charge them to give their masters a message from me. Tell them, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says to give your masters this message.
19602	24	27	5	“I made the earth and the people and animals on it by my mighty power and great strength, and I give it to whomever I see fit.
19603	24	27	6	I have at this time placed all these nations of yours under the power of my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have even made all the wild animals subject to him.
19604	24	27	7	All nations must serve him and his son and grandson until the time comes for his own nation to fall. Then many nations and great kings will in turn subjugate Babylon.
19605	24	27	8	But suppose a nation or a kingdom will not be subject to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Suppose it will not submit to the yoke of servitude to him. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that I will punish that nation. I will use the king of Babylon to punish it with war, starvation, and disease until I have destroyed it.
19606	24	27	9	So do not listen to your prophets or to those who claim to predict the future by divination, by dreams, by consulting the dead, or by practicing magic. They keep telling you, ‘You do not need to be subject to the king of Babylon.’
19607	24	27	10	Do not listen to them, because their prophecies are lies. Listening to them will only cause you to be taken far away from your native land. I will drive you out of your country and you will die in exile.
19608	24	27	11	Things will go better for the nation that submits to the yoke of servitude to the king of Babylon and is subject to him. I will leave that nation in its native land. Its people can continue to farm it and live in it. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!”’”
19609	24	27	12	¶I told King Zedekiah of Judah the same thing. I said, “Submit to the yoke of servitude to the king of Babylon. Be subject to him and his people. Then you will continue to live.
19610	24	27	13	There is no reason why you and your people should die in war or from starvation or disease! That’s what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says will happen to any nation that will not be subject to the king of Babylon.
19611	24	27	14	Do not listen to the prophets who are telling you that you do not need to serve the king of Babylon. For they are prophesying lies to you.
19612	24	27	15	For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that I did not send them. They are prophesying lies to you in my name. If you listen to them, I will drive you and the prophets who are prophesying lies out of the land and you will all die in exile.”
19613	24	27	16	¶I also told the priests and all the people, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘Do not listen to what your prophets are saying. They are prophesying to you that the valuable articles taken from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple will be brought back from Babylon very soon. But they are prophesying a lie to you.
19614	24	27	17	Do not listen to them. Be subject to the king of Babylon. Then you will continue to live. Why should this city be made a pile of rubble?’”
19615	24	27	18	I also told them, “If they are really prophets and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking to them, let them pray earnestly to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. Let them plead with him not to let the valuable articles that are still left in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, in the royal palace of Judah, and in Jerusalem be taken away to Babylon.
19616	24	27	19	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has already spoken about the two bronze pillars, the large bronze basin called ‘The Sea,’ and the movable bronze stands. He has already spoken about the rest of the valuable articles that are left in this city.
19617	24	27	20	He has already spoken about these things that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiakim’s son King Jeconiah of Judah and the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem away as captives from Jerusalem to Babylon.
19618	24	27	21	Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel has already spoken about the valuable articles that are left in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, in the royal palace of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
19619	24	27	22	He has said, ‘They will be carried off to Babylon. They will remain there until it is time for me to show consideration for them again. Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’ I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm this!”
19620	24	28	1	¶The following events occurred in that same year, early in the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah. To be more precise, it was the fifth month of the fourth year of his reign. The prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, spoke to Jeremiah in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple in the presence of the priests and all the people.
19621	24	28	2	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘I will break the yoke of servitude to the king of Babylon.
19622	24	28	3	Before two years are over, I will bring back to this place everything that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took from it and carried away to Babylon.
19623	24	28	4	I will also bring back to this place Jehoiakim’s son King Jeconiah of Judah and all the exiles who were taken to Babylon.’ Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> affirms, ‘I will break the yoke of servitude to the king of Babylon.’”
19624	24	28	5	¶Then the prophet Jeremiah responded to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
19625	24	28	6	The prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> do all this! May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> make your prophecy come true! May he bring back to this place from Babylon all the valuable articles taken from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and the people who were carried into exile.
19626	24	28	7	But listen to what I say to you and to all these people.
19627	24	28	8	From earliest times, the prophets who preceded you and me invariably prophesied war, disaster, and plagues against many countries and great kingdoms.
19628	24	28	9	So if a prophet prophesied peace and prosperity, it was only known that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> truly sent him when what he prophesied came true.”
19629	24	28	10	¶The prophet Hananiah then took the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck and broke it.
19630	24	28	11	Then he spoke up in the presence of all the people. “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘In the same way I will break the yoke of servitude of all the nations to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon before two years are over.’” After he heard this, the prophet Jeremiah departed and went on his way.
19631	24	28	12	¶But shortly after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah.
19632	24	28	13	“Go and tell Hananiah that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘You have indeed broken the wooden yoke. But you have only succeeded in replacing it with an iron one!
19633	24	28	14	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, “I have put an irresistible yoke of servitude on all these nations so they will serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. And they will indeed serve him. I have even given him control over the wild animals.”’”
19634	24	28	15	Then the prophet Jeremiah told the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did not send you! You are making these people trust in a lie!
19635	24	28	16	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘I will most assuredly remove you from the face of the earth. You will die this very year because you have counseled rebellion against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
19636	24	28	17	¶In the seventh month of that very same year the prophet Hananiah died.
19637	24	29	1	¶The prophet Jeremiah sent a letter to the exiles Nebuchadnezzar had carried off from Jerusalem to Babylon. It was addressed to the elders who were left among the exiles, to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the other people who were exiled in Babylon.
19638	24	29	2	He sent it after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the palace officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had been exiled from Jerusalem.
19639	24	29	3	He sent it with Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah. King Zedekiah of Judah had sent these men to Babylon to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. The letter said:
19640	24	29	4	¶“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says to all those he sent into exile to Babylon from Jerusalem,
19641	24	29	5	‘Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what they produce.
19642	24	29	6	Marry and have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons and allow your daughters to get married so that they too can have sons and daughters. Grow in number; do not dwindle away.
19643	24	29	7	Work to see that the city where I sent you as exiles enjoys peace and prosperity. Pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for it. For as it prospers you will prosper.’
19644	24	29	8	¶“For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘Do not let the prophets among you or those who claim to be able to predict the future by divination deceive you. And do not pay any attention to the dreams that you are encouraging them to dream.
19645	24	29	9	They are prophesying lies to you and claiming my authority to do so. But I did not send them. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!’
19646	24	29	10	¶“For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘Only when the seventy years of Babylonian rule are over will I again take up consideration for you. Then I will fulfill my gracious promise to you and restore you to your homeland.
19647	24	29	11	For I know what I have planned for you,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‘I have plans to prosper you, not to harm you. I have plans to give you a future filled with hope.
19648	24	29	12	When you call out to me and come to me in prayer, I will hear your prayers.
19649	24	29	13	When you seek me in prayer and worship, you will find me available to you. If you seek me with all your heart and soul,
19650	24	29	14	I will make myself available to you,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‘Then I will reverse your plight and will regather you from all the nations and all the places where I have exiled you,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‘I will bring you back to the place from which I exiled you.’
19651	24	29	15	¶“You say, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has raised up prophets of good news for us here in Babylon.’
19652	24	29	16	But just listen to what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has to say about the king who occupies David’s throne and all your fellow countrymen who are still living in this city of Jerusalem and were not carried off into exile with you.
19653	24	29	17	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘I will bring war, starvation, and disease on them. I will treat them like figs that are so rotten they cannot be eaten.
19654	24	29	18	I will chase after them with war, starvation, and disease. I will make all the kingdoms of the earth horrified at what happens to them. I will make them examples of those who are cursed, objects of horror, hissing scorn, and ridicule among all the nations where I exile them.
19655	24	29	19	For they have not paid attention to what I said to them through my servants the prophets whom I sent to them over and over again,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‘And you exiles have not paid any attention to them either,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19656	24	29	20	‘So pay attention to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message, all you exiles whom I have sent to Babylon from Jerusalem.’
19657	24	29	21	¶“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel also has something to say about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you and claiming my authority to do so. ‘I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and he will execute them before your very eyes.
19658	24	29	22	And all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon will use them as examples when they put a curse on anyone. They will say, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab whom the king of Babylon roasted to death in the fire!”
19659	24	29	23	This will happen to them because they have done what is shameful in Israel. They have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives and have spoken lies while claiming my authority. They have spoken words that I did not command them to speak. I know what they have done. I have been a witness to it,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
19660	24	29	24	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Jeremiah, “Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite
19661	24	29	25	that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel has a message for him. Tell him, ‘On your own initiative you sent a letter to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah and to all the other priests and to all the people in Jerusalem. In your letter you said to Zephaniah,
19662	24	29	26	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has made you priest in place of Jehoiada. He has put you in charge in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple of controlling any lunatic who pretends to be a prophet. And it is your duty to put any such person in the stocks with an iron collar around his neck.
19663	24	29	27	You should have reprimanded Jeremiah from Anathoth who is pretending to be a prophet among you!
19664	24	29	28	For he has even sent a message to us here in Babylon. He wrote and told us, “You will be there a long time. Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what they produce.”’”
19665	24	29	29	¶Zephaniah the priest read that letter to the prophet Jeremiah.
19666	24	29	30	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah.
19667	24	29	31	“Send a message to all the exiles in Babylon. Tell them, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken about Shemaiah the Nehelamite. “Shemaiah has spoken to you as a prophet even though I did not send him. He is making you trust in a lie.
19668	24	29	32	Because he has done this,” the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his whole family. There will not be any of them left to experience the good things that I will do for my people. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it! For he counseled rebellion against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”’”
19669	24	30	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah.
19670	24	30	2	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel says, ‘Write everything that I am about to tell you in a scroll.
19671	24	30	3	For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that the time will come when I will reverse the plight of my people, Israel and Judah,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‘I will bring them back to the land I gave their ancestors and they will take possession of it once again.’”
19672	24	30	4	¶So here is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has to say about Israel and Judah.
19673	24	30	5	¶Yes, here is what he says:‡“You hear cries of panic and of terror;‡there is no peace in sight.
19674	24	30	6	‡Ask yourselves this and consider it carefully: ‡Have you ever seen a man give birth to a baby?‡Why then do I see all these strong men‡grabbing their stomachs in pain like a woman giving birth?‡And why do their faces‡turn so deathly pale?
19675	24	30	7	‡Alas, what a terrible time of trouble it is! ‡There has never been any like it.‡It is a time of trouble for the descendants of Jacob,‡but some of them will be rescued out of it.
19676	24	30	8	‡When the time for them to be rescued comes,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‡“I will rescue you from foreign subjugation. ‡I will deliver you from captivity. ‡Foreigners will then no longer subjugate them.
19677	24	30	9	‡But they will be subject to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God‡and to the Davidic ruler whom I will raise up as king over them.
19678	24	30	10	‡So I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, tell you not to be afraid, ‡you descendants of Jacob, my servants. ‡Do not be terrified, people of Israel.‡For I will rescue you and your descendants‡from a faraway land where you are captives. ‡The descendants of Jacob will return to their land and enjoy peace.‡They will be secure and no one will terrify them.
19679	24	30	11	‡For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that ‡I will be with you and will rescue you.‡I will completely destroy all the nations where I scattered you.‡But I will not completely destroy you.‡I will indeed discipline you, but only in due measure.‡I will not allow you to go entirely unpunished.”
19680	24	30	12	¶Moreover, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to the people of Zion, ‡“Your injuries are incurable;‡your wounds are severe.
19681	24	30	13	‡There is no one to plead your cause.‡There are no remedies for your wounds. ‡There is no healing for you.
19682	24	30	14	‡All your allies have abandoned you. ‡They no longer have any concern for you.‡For I have attacked you like an enemy would.‡I have chastened you cruelly.‡For your wickedness is so great‡and your sin is so much.
19683	24	30	15	‡Why do you complain about your injuries,‡that your pain is incurable?‡I have done all this to you‡because your wickedness is so great‡and your sin is so much.
19684	24	30	16	‡But all who destroyed you will be destroyed.‡All your enemies will go into exile.‡Those who plundered you will be plundered.‡I will cause those who pillaged you to be pillaged.
19685	24	30	17	‡Yes, I will restore you to health.‡I will heal your wounds.‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it! ‡For you have been called an outcast,‡Zion, whom no one cares for.”
19686	24	30	18	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“I will restore the ruined houses of the descendants of Jacob.‡I will show compassion on their ruined homes. ‡Every city will be rebuilt on its former ruins. ‡Every fortified dwelling will occupy its traditional site.
19687	24	30	19	‡Out of those places you will hear songs of thanksgiving ‡and the sounds of laughter and merriment.‡I will increase their number and they will not dwindle away. ‡I will bring them honor and they will no longer be despised.
19688	24	30	20	‡The descendants of Jacob will enjoy their former privileges.‡Their community will be reestablished in my favor ‡and I will punish all who try to oppress them.
19689	24	30	21	‡One of their own people will be their leader.‡Their ruler will come from their own number. ‡I will invite him to approach me, and he will do so. ‡For no one would dare approach me on his own. ‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!
19690	24	30	22	‡Then you will again be my people‡and I will be your God.
19691	24	30	23	‡Just watch! The wrath of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡will come like a storm.‡Like a raging storm it will rage down ‡on the heads of those who are wicked.
19692	24	30	24	‡The anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will not turn back‡until he has fully carried out his intended purposes.‡In days to come you will come to understand this.
19693	24	31	1	‡At that time I will be the God of all the clans of Israel ‡and they will be my people.‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!”
19694	24	31	2	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“The people of Israel who survived ‡death at the hands of the enemy ‡will find favor in the wilderness‡as they journey to find rest for themselves.
19695	24	31	3	‡In a far-off land the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will manifest himself to them.‡He will say to them, ‘I have loved you with an everlasting love.‡That is why I have continued to be faithful to you.
19696	24	31	4	‡I will rebuild you, my dear children Israel, ‡so that you will once again be built up.‡Once again you will take up the tambourine‡and join in the happy throng of dancers.
19697	24	31	5	‡Once again you will plant vineyards‡on the hills of Samaria. ‡Those who plant them‡will once again enjoy their fruit.
19698	24	31	6	‡Yes, a time is coming‡when watchmen will call out on the mountains of Ephraim,‡“Come! Let us go to Zion‡to worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God!”’”
19699	24	31	7	¶Moreover, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“Sing for joy for the descendants of Jacob.‡Utter glad shouts for that foremost of the nations. ‡Make your praises heard. ‡Then say, ‘<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, rescue your people.‡Deliver those of Israel who remain alive.’
19700	24	31	8	‡Then I will reply, ‘I will bring them back from the land of the north.‡I will gather them in from the distant parts of the earth.‡Blind and lame people will come with them,‡so will pregnant women and women about to give birth.‡A vast throng of people will come back here.
19701	24	31	9	‡They will come back shedding tears of contrition.‡I will bring them back praying prayers of repentance. ‡I will lead them besides streams of water,‡along smooth paths where they will never stumble. ‡I will do this because I am Israel’s father;‡Ephraim is my firstborn son.’”
19702	24	31	10	‡Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message, O nations.‡Proclaim it in the faraway lands along the sea.‡Say, “The one who scattered Israel will regather them.‡He will watch over his people like a shepherd watches over his flock.”
19703	24	31	11	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will rescue the descendants of Jacob.‡He will secure their release from those who had overpowered them.
19704	24	31	12	‡They will come and shout for joy on Mount Zion.‡They will be radiant with joy over the good things the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> provides,‡the grain, the fresh wine, the olive oil,‡the young sheep and calves he has given to them.‡They will be like a well-watered garden‡and will not grow faint or weary any more.
19705	24	31	13	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “At that time young women will dance and be glad.‡Young men and old men will rejoice. ‡I will turn their grief into gladness.‡I will give them comfort and joy in place of their sorrow.
19706	24	31	14	‡I will provide the priests with abundant provisions. ‡My people will be filled to the full with the good things I provide.”
19707	24	31	15	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“A sound is heard in Ramah, ‡a sound of crying in bitter grief.‡It is the sound of Rachel weeping for her children‡and refusing to be comforted, because her children are gone.”
19708	24	31	16	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to her, ‡“Stop crying! Do not shed any more tears! ‡For your heartfelt repentance will be rewarded.‡Your children will return from the land of the enemy.‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!
19709	24	31	17	‡Indeed, there is hope for your posterity. ‡Your children will return to their own territory.‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!
19710	24	31	18	‡I have indeed heard the people of Israel say mournfully,‡‘We were like a calf untrained to the yoke. ‡You disciplined us and we learned from it. ‡Let us come back to you and we will do so, ‡for you are the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God.
19711	24	31	19	‡For after we turned away from you we repented.‡After we came to our senses we struck our thigh in sorrow. ‡We are ashamed and humiliated‡because of the disgraceful things we did previously.’
19712	24	31	20	‡Indeed, the people of Israel are my dear children.‡They are the children I take delight in. ‡For even though I must often rebuke them,‡I still remember them with fondness.‡So I am deeply moved with pity for them ‡and will surely have compassion on them.‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!
19713	24	31	21	‡I will say, ‘My dear children of Israel, keep in mind‡the road you took when you were carried off. ‡Mark off in your minds the landmarks.‡Make a mental note of telltale signs marking the way back.‡Return, my dear children of Israel.‡Return to these cities of yours.
19714	24	31	22	‡How long will you vacillate, ‡you who were once like an unfaithful daughter? ‡For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, promise to bring about something new on the earth,‡something as unique as a woman protecting a man!’”
19715	24	31	23	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‡“I will restore the people of Judah to their land and to their towns.‡When I do, they will again say of Jerusalem, ‡‘May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> bless you, you holy mountain,‡the place where righteousness dwells.’
19716	24	31	24	‡The land of Judah will be inhabited by people who live in its towns‡as well as by farmers and shepherds with their flocks.
19717	24	31	25	‡I will fully satisfy the needs of those who are weary‡and fully refresh the souls of those who are faint.
19718	24	31	26	‡Then they will say, ‘Under these conditions I can enjoy sweet sleep‡when I wake up and look around.’”
19719	24	31	27	¶“Indeed, a time is coming,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “when I will cause people and animals to sprout up in the lands of Israel and Judah.
19720	24	31	28	In the past I saw to it that they were uprooted and torn down, that they were destroyed and demolished and brought disaster. But now I will see to it that they are built up and firmly planted. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!”
19721	24	31	29	¶“When that time comes, people will no longer say, ‘The parents have eaten sour grapes, but the children’s teeth have grown numb.’
19722	24	31	30	Rather, each person will die for his own sins. The teeth of the person who eats the sour grapes will themselves grow numb.
19723	24	31	31	¶“Indeed, a time is coming,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah.
19724	24	31	32	It will not be like the old covenant that I made with their ancestors when I delivered them from Egypt. For they violated that covenant, even though I was like a faithful husband to them,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19725	24	31	33	“But I will make a new covenant with the whole nation of Israel after I plant them back in the land,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. “I will put my law within them and write it on their hearts and minds. I will be their God and they will be my people.
19726	24	31	34	¶“People will no longer need to teach their neighbors and relatives to know me. For all of them, from the least important to the most important, will know me,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. “For I will forgive their sin and will no longer call to mind the wrong they have done.”
19727	24	31	35	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has made a promise to Israel.‡He promises it as the one who fixed the sun to give light by day‡and the moon and stars to give light by night.‡He promises it as the one who stirs up the sea so that its waves roll.‡His name is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
19728	24	31	36	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> affirms, “The descendants of Israel will not‡cease forever to be a nation in my sight.‡That could only happen if the fixed ordering of the heavenly lights‡were to cease to operate before me.”
19729	24	31	37	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “I will not reject all the descendants of Israel‡because of all that they have done. ‡That could only happen if the heavens above could be measured‡or the foundations of the earth below could all be explored,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19730	24	31	38	¶“Indeed a time is coming,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “when the city of Jerusalem will be rebuilt as my special city. It will be built from the Tower of Hananel westward to the Corner Gate.
19731	24	31	39	The boundary line will extend beyond that, straight west from there to the Hill of Gareb and then turn southward to Goah.
19732	24	31	40	The whole valley where dead bodies and sacrificial ashes are thrown and all the terraced fields out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far north as the corner of the Horse Gate will be included within this city that is sacred to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The city will never again be torn down or destroyed.”
19733	24	32	1	¶In the tenth year that Zedekiah was ruling over Judah the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah. That was the same as the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
19734	24	32	2	¶Now at that time, the armies of the king of Babylon were besieging Jerusalem. The prophet Jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse attached to the royal palace of Judah.
19735	24	32	3	For King Zedekiah had confined Jeremiah there after he had reproved him for prophesying as he did. He had asked Jeremiah, “Why do you keep prophesying these things? Why do you keep saying that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘I will hand this city over to the king of Babylon? I will let him capture it.
19736	24	32	4	King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the Babylonians. He will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon. He must answer personally to the king of Babylon and confront him face to face.
19737	24	32	5	Zedekiah will be carried off to Babylon and will remain there until I have fully dealt with him. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it! Even if you continue to fight against the Babylonians, you cannot win.’”
19738	24	32	6	¶So now, Jeremiah said, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me,
19739	24	32	7	‘Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you soon. He will say to you, “Buy my field at Anathoth because you are entitled as my closest relative to buy it.”’
19740	24	32	8	And then my cousin Hanamel did come to me in the courtyard of the guardhouse in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message. He said to me, ‘Buy my field which is at Anathoth in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. Buy it for yourself since you are entitled as my closest relative to take possession of it for yourself.’ When this happened, I recognized that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had indeed spoken to me.
19741	24	32	9	So I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel. I weighed out seven ounces of silver and gave it to him to pay for it.
19742	24	32	10	I signed the deed of purchase, sealed it, and had some men serve as witnesses to the purchase. I weighed out the silver for him on a scale.
19743	24	32	11	There were two copies of the deed of purchase. One was sealed and contained the order of transfer and the conditions of purchase. The other was left unsealed.
19744	24	32	12	I took both copies of the deed of purchase and gave them to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah. I gave them to him in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, the witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase, and all the Judeans who were housed in the courtyard of the guardhouse.
19745	24	32	13	In the presence of all these people I instructed Baruch,
19746	24	32	14	‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, “Take these documents, both the sealed copy of the deed of purchase and the unsealed copy. Put them in a clay jar so that they may be preserved for a long time to come.”’
19747	24	32	15	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, “Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.”’
19748	24	32	16	¶“After I had given the copies of the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
19749	24	32	17	‘Oh, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you did indeed make heaven and earth by your mighty power and great strength. Nothing is too hard for you!
19750	24	32	18	You show unfailing love to thousands. But you also punish children for the sins of their parents. You are the great and powerful God whose is name is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
19751	24	32	19	You plan great things and you do mighty deeds. You see everything people do. You reward each of them for the way they live and for the things they do.
19752	24	32	20	You did miracles and amazing deeds in the land of Egypt which have had lasting effect. By this means you gained both in Israel and among humankind a renown that lasts to this day.
19753	24	32	21	You used your mighty power and your great strength to perform miracles and amazing deeds and to bring great terror on the Egyptians. By this means you brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt.
19754	24	32	22	You kept the promise that you swore on oath to their ancestors. You gave them a land flowing with milk and honey.
19755	24	32	23	But when they came in and took possession of it, they did not obey you or live as you had instructed them. They did not do anything that you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster on them.
19756	24	32	24	Even now siege ramps have been built up around the city in order to capture it. War, starvation, and disease are sure to make the city fall into the hands of the Babylonians who are attacking it. <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you threatened that this would happen. Now you can see that it is already taking place.
19757	24	32	25	The city is sure to fall into the hands of the Babylonians. Yet, in spite of this, you, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have said to me, “Buy that field with silver and have the transaction legally witnessed.”’”
19758	24	32	26	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah.
19759	24	32	27	“I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of all humankind. There is, indeed, nothing too difficult for me.
19760	24	32	28	Therefore I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: ‘I will indeed hand this city over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the Babylonian army. They will capture it.
19761	24	32	29	The Babylonian soldiers that are attacking this city will break into it and set it on fire. They will burn it down along with the houses where people have made me angry by offering sacrifices to the god Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods on their rooftops.
19762	24	32	30	This will happen because the people of Israel and Judah have repeatedly done what displeases me from their earliest history until now and because they have repeatedly made me angry by the things they have done. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!
19763	24	32	31	This will happen because the people of this city have aroused my anger and my wrath since the time they built it until now. They have made me so angry that I am determined to remove it from my sight.
19764	24	32	32	I am determined to do so because the people of Israel and Judah have made me angry with all their wickedness – they, their kings, their officials, their priests, their prophets, and especially the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem have done this wickedness.
19765	24	32	33	They have turned away from me instead of turning to me. I tried over and over again to instruct them, but they did not listen and respond to correction.
19766	24	32	34	They set up their disgusting idols in the temple which I have claimed for my own and defiled it.
19767	24	32	35	They built places of worship for the god Baal in the valley of Ben Hinnom so that they could sacrifice their sons and daughters to the god Molech. Such a disgusting practice was not something I commanded them to do! It never even entered my mind to command them to do such a thing! So Judah is certainly liable for punishment.’
19768	24	32	36	¶“You and your people are right in saying, ‘War, starvation, and disease are sure to make this city fall into the hands of the king of Babylon.’ But now I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, have something further to say about this city:
19769	24	32	37	‘I will certainly regather my people from all the countries where I will have exiled them in my anger, fury, and great wrath. I will bring them back to this place and allow them to live here in safety.
19770	24	32	38	They will be my people, and I will be their God.
19771	24	32	39	I will give them a single-minded purpose to live in a way that always shows respect for me. They will want to do that for their own good and the good of the children who descend from them.
19772	24	32	40	I will make a lasting covenant with them that I will never stop doing good to them. I will fill their hearts and minds with respect for me so that they will never again turn away from me.
19773	24	32	41	I will take delight in doing good to them. I will faithfully and wholeheartedly plant them firmly in the land.’
19774	24	32	42	¶“For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: ‘I will surely bring on these people all the good fortune that I am hereby promising them. I will be just as sure to do that as I have been in bringing all this great disaster on them.
19775	24	32	43	You and your people are saying that this land will become desolate, uninhabited by either people or animals. You are saying that it will be handed over to the Babylonians. But fields will again be bought in this land.
19776	24	32	44	Fields will again be bought with silver, and deeds of purchase signed, sealed, and witnessed. This will happen in the territory of Benjamin, the villages surrounding Jerusalem, the towns in Judah, the southern hill country, the foothills, and southern Judah. For I will restore them to their land. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!’”
19777	24	33	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah a second time while he was still confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse.
19778	24	33	2	“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, do these things. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, form the plan to bring them about. I am known as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. I say to you,
19779	24	33	3	‘Call on me in prayer and I will answer you. I will show you great and mysterious things which you still do not know about.’
19780	24	33	4	For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, have something more to say about the houses in this city and the royal buildings of Judah which have been torn down for defenses against the siege ramps and military incursions of the Babylonians:
19781	24	33	5	‘The defenders of the city will go out and fight with the Babylonians. But they will only fill those houses and buildings with the dead bodies of the people that I will kill in my anger and my wrath. That will happen because I have decided to turn my back on this city on account of the wicked things they have done.
19782	24	33	6	But I will most surely heal the wounds of this city and restore it and its people to health. I will show them abundant peace and security.
19783	24	33	7	I will restore Judah and Israel and will rebuild them as they were in days of old.
19784	24	33	8	I will purify them from all the sin that they committed against me. I will forgive all their sins which they committed in rebelling against me.
19785	24	33	9	All the nations will hear about all the good things which I will do to them. This city will bring me fame, honor, and praise before them for the joy that I bring it. The nations will tremble in awe at all the peace and prosperity that I will provide for it.’
19786	24	33	10	¶“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: ‘You and your people are saying about this place, “It lies in ruins. There are no people or animals in it.” That is true. The towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem will soon be desolate, uninhabited either by people or by animals. But happy sounds will again be heard in these places.
19787	24	33	11	Once again there will be sounds of joy and gladness and the glad celebrations of brides and grooms. Once again people will bring their thank offerings to the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and will say, “Give thanks to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is good and his unfailing love lasts forever.” For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that I will restore the land to what it was in days of old.’
19788	24	33	12	¶“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, say: ‘This place will indeed lie in ruins. There will be no people or animals in it. But there will again be in it and in its towns sheepfolds where shepherds can rest their sheep.
19789	24	33	13	I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say that shepherds will once again count their sheep as they pass into the fold. They will do this in all the towns in the hill country, the foothills, the Negev , the territory of Benjamin, the villages surrounding Jerusalem, and the towns of Judah.’
19790	24	33	14	¶“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm: ‘The time will certainly come when I will fulfill my gracious promise concerning the nations of Israel and Judah.
19791	24	33	15	In those days and at that time I will raise up for them a righteous descendant of David.¶“‘He will do what is just and right in the land.
19792	24	33	16	Under his rule Judah will enjoy safety and Jerusalem will live in security. At that time Jerusalem will be called “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has provided us with justice.”
19793	24	33	17	For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, promise: “David will never lack a successor to occupy the throne over the nation of Israel.
19794	24	33	18	Nor will the Levitical priests ever lack someone to stand before me and continually offer up burnt offerings, sacrifice cereal offerings, and offer the other sacrifices.”’”
19795	24	33	19	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah another time.
19796	24	33	20	“I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, make the following promise: ‘I have made a covenant with the day and with the night that they will always come at their proper times. Only if you people could break that covenant
19797	24	33	21	could my covenant with my servant David and my covenant with the Levites ever be broken. So David will by all means always have a descendant to occupy his throne as king and the Levites will by all means always have priests who will minister before me.
19798	24	33	22	I will make the children who follow one another in the line of my servant David very numerous. I will also make the Levites who minister before me very numerous. I will make them all as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sands which are on the seashore.’”
19799	24	33	23	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah another time.
19800	24	33	24	“You have surely noticed what these people are saying, haven’t you? They are saying, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has rejected the two families of Israel and Judah that he chose.’ So they have little regard that my people will ever again be a nation.
19801	24	33	25	But I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, make the following promise: I have made a covenant governing the coming of day and night. I have established the fixed laws governing heaven and earth.
19802	24	33	26	Just as surely as I have done this, so surely will I never reject the descendants of Jacob. Nor will I ever refuse to choose one of my servant David’s descendants to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Indeed, I will restore them and show mercy to them.”
19803	24	34	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah while King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and the towns around it with a large army. This army consisted of troops from his own army and from the kingdoms and peoples of the lands under his dominion.
19804	24	34	2	This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel told Jeremiah, “Go, speak to King Zedekiah of Judah. Tell him, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, “Take note. I am going to hand this city over to the king of Babylon and he will burn it down.
19805	24	34	3	You yourself will not escape his clutches, but will certainly be captured and handed over to him. You must confront the king of Babylon face to face and answer to him personally. Then you must go to Babylon.”’”
19806	24	34	4	However, listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message, King Zedekiah of Judah. This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, “You will not die in battle or be executed.
19807	24	34	5	You will die a peaceful death. They will burn incense at your burial just as they did at the burial of your ancestors, the former kings who preceded you. They will mourn for you, saying, ‘Alas master!’ Indeed, you have my own word on this. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!”
19808	24	34	6	¶The prophet Jeremiah told all these things to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem.
19809	24	34	7	He did this while the army of the king of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and the cities of Lachish and Azekah. He was attacking these cities because they were the only fortified cities of Judah which were still holding out.
19810	24	34	8	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to grant their slaves their freedom.
19811	24	34	9	Everyone was supposed to free their male and female Hebrew slaves. No one was supposed to keep a fellow Judean enslaved.
19812	24	34	10	All the people and their leaders had agreed to this. They had agreed to free their male and female slaves and not keep them enslaved any longer. They originally complied with the covenant and freed them.
19813	24	34	11	But later they had changed their minds. They had taken back their male and female slaves that they had freed and forced them to be slaves again.
19814	24	34	12	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah,
19815	24	34	13	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has a message for you. ‘I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt where they had been slaves. It stipulated,
19816	24	34	14	“Every seven years each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you for six years, you shall set them free.” But your ancestors did not obey me or pay any attention to me.
19817	24	34	15	Recently, however, you yourselves showed a change of heart and did what is pleasing to me. You granted your fellow countrymen their freedom and you made a covenant to that effect in my presence in the house that I have claimed for my own.
19818	24	34	16	But then you turned right around and showed that you did not honor me. Each of you took back your male and female slaves whom you had freed as they desired, and you forced them to be your slaves again.
19819	24	34	17	So I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: “You have not really obeyed me and granted freedom to your neighbor and fellow countryman. Therefore, I will grant you freedom, the freedom to die in war, or by starvation or disease. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it! I will make all the kingdoms of the earth horrified at what happens to you.
19820	24	34	18	I will punish those people who have violated their covenant with me. I will make them like the calf they cut in two and passed between its pieces. I will do so because they did not keep the terms of the covenant they made in my presence.
19821	24	34	19	I will punish the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the other people of the land who passed between the pieces of the calf.
19822	24	34	20	I will hand them over to their enemies who want to kill them. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.
19823	24	34	21	I will also hand King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials over to their enemies who want to kill them. I will hand them over to the army of the king of Babylon, even though they have temporarily withdrawn from attacking you.
19824	24	34	22	For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that I will soon give the order and bring them back to this city. They will fight against it and capture it and burn it down. I will also make the towns of Judah desolate so that there will be no one living in them.”’”
19825	24	35	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah when Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.
19826	24	35	2	“Go to the Rechabite community. Invite them to come into one of the side rooms of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple and offer them some wine to drink.”
19827	24	35	3	So I went and got Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah the grandson of Habazziniah, his brothers, all his sons, and all the rest of the Rechabite community.
19828	24	35	4	I took them to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. I took them into the room where the disciples of the prophet Hanan son of Igdaliah stayed. That room was next to the one where the temple officers stayed and above the room where Maaseiah son of Shallum, one of the doorkeepers of the temple, stayed.
19829	24	35	5	Then I set cups and pitchers full of wine in front of the members of the Rechabite community and said to them, “Have some wine.”
19830	24	35	6	But they answered, “We do not drink wine because our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us not to. He told us, ‘You and your children must never drink wine.
19831	24	35	7	Do not build houses. Do not plant crops. Do not plant a vineyard or own one. Live in tents all your lives. If you do these things you will live a long time in the land that you wander about on.’
19832	24	35	8	We and our wives and our sons and daughters have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us. We have never drunk wine.
19833	24	35	9	We have not built any houses to live in. We do not own any vineyards, fields, or crops.
19834	24	35	10	We have lived in tents. We have obeyed our ancestor Jonadab and done exactly as he commanded us.
19835	24	35	11	But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded the land we said, ‘Let’s get up and go to Jerusalem to get away from the Babylonian and Aramean armies.’ That is why we are staying here in Jerusalem.”
19836	24	35	12	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah.
19837	24	35	13	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel told him, “Go and speak to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem. Tell them, ‘I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, say: “You must learn a lesson from this about obeying what I say!
19838	24	35	14	Jonadab son of Rechab ordered his descendants not to drink wine. His orders have been carried out. To this day his descendants have drunk no wine because they have obeyed what their ancestor commanded them. But I have spoken to you over and over again, but you have not obeyed me!
19839	24	35	15	I sent all my servants the prophets to warn you over and over again. They said, “Every one of you, stop doing the evil things you have been doing and do what is right. Do not pay allegiance to other gods and worship them. Then you can continue to live in this land that I gave to you and your ancestors.” But you did not pay any attention or listen to me.
19840	24	35	16	Yes, the descendants of Jonadab son of Rechab have carried out the orders that their ancestor gave them. But you people have not obeyed me!
19841	24	35	17	So I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, say: “I will soon bring on Judah and all the citizens of Jerusalem all the disaster that I threatened to bring on them. I will do this because I spoke to them but they did not listen. I called out to them but they did not answer.”’”
19842	24	35	18	¶Then Jeremiah spoke to the Rechabite community, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘You have obeyed the orders of your ancestor Jonadab. You have followed all his instructions. You have done exactly as he commanded you.’
19843	24	35	19	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘Jonadab son of Rechab will never lack a male descendant to serve me.’”
19844	24	36	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.
19845	24	36	2	“Get a scroll. Write on it everything I have told you to say about Israel, Judah, and all the other nations since I began to speak to you in the reign of Josiah until now.
19846	24	36	3	Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the disaster I intend to bring on them, they will all stop doing the evil things they have been doing. If they do, I will forgive their sins and the wicked things they have done.”
19847	24	36	4	¶So Jeremiah summoned Baruch son of Neriah. Then, Baruch wrote down in a scroll all of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s words which he had told to Jeremiah as they came from his mouth.
19848	24	36	5	Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am no longer allowed to go into the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
19849	24	36	6	So you go there the next time all the people of Judah come in from their towns to fast in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. Read out loud where all of them can hear you what I told you the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, which you wrote in the scroll.
19850	24	36	7	Perhaps then they will ask the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for mercy and will all stop doing the evil things they have been doing. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has threatened to bring great anger and wrath against these people.”
19851	24	36	8	¶So Baruch son of Neriah did exactly what the prophet Jeremiah had told him to do. He read what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had said from the scroll in the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
19852	24	36	9	All the people living in Jerusalem and all the people who came into Jerusalem from the towns of Judah came to observe a fast before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. The fast took place in the ninth month of the fifth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.
19853	24	36	10	At that time Baruch went into the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He stood in the entrance of the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan who had been the royal secretary. That room was in the upper court near the entrance of the New Gate. There, where all the people could hear him, he read from the scroll what Jeremiah had said.
19854	24	36	11	¶Micaiah, who was the son of Gemariah and the grandson of Shaphan, heard Baruch read from the scroll everything the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had said.
19855	24	36	12	He went down to the chamber of the royal secretary in the king’s palace and found all the court officials in session there. Elishama the royal secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials were seated there.
19856	24	36	13	Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.
19857	24	36	14	All the officials sent Jehudi, who was the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch. They ordered him to tell Baruch, “Come here and bring with you the scroll you read in the hearing of the people.” So Baruch son of Neriah went to them, carrying the scroll in his hand.
19858	24	36	15	They said to him, “Please sit down and read it to us.” So Baruch sat down and read it to them.
19859	24	36	16	When they had heard it all, they expressed their alarm to one another. Then they said to Baruch, “We must certainly give the king a report about everything you have read!”
19860	24	36	17	Then they asked Baruch, “How did you come to write all these words? Do they actually come from Jeremiah’s mouth?”
19861	24	36	18	Baruch answered, “Yes, they came from his own mouth. He dictated all these words to me and I wrote them down in ink on this scroll.”
19862	24	36	19	Then the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah must go and hide. You must not let anyone know where you are.”
19863	24	36	20	¶The officials put the scroll in the room of Elishama, the royal secretary, for safekeeping. Then they went to the court and reported everything to the king.
19864	24	36	21	The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. He went and got it from the room of Elishama, the royal secretary. Then he himself read it to the king and all the officials who were standing around him.
19865	24	36	22	Since it was the ninth month of the year, the king was sitting in his winter quarters. A fire was burning in the firepot in front of him.
19866	24	36	23	As soon as Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king would cut them off with a penknife and throw them on the fire in the firepot. He kept doing so until the whole scroll was burned up in the fire.
19867	24	36	24	Neither he nor any of his attendants showed any alarm when they heard all that had been read. Nor did they tear their clothes to show any grief or sorrow.
19868	24	36	25	The king did not even listen to Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah, who had urged him not to burn the scroll.
19869	24	36	26	He also ordered Jerahmeel, who was one of the royal princes, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah. However, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hid them.
19870	24	36	27	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll with the words Baruch had written down at Jeremiah’s dictation.
19871	24	36	28	“Get another scroll and write on it everything that was written on the original scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned.
19872	24	36	29	Tell King Jehoiakim of Judah, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “You burned the scroll. You asked Jeremiah, ‘How dare you write in this scroll that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and wipe out all the people and animals on it?’”
19873	24	36	30	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah, “None of his line will occupy the throne of David. His dead body will be thrown out to be exposed to scorching heat by day and frost by night.
19874	24	36	31	I will punish him and his descendants and the officials who serve him for the wicked things they have done. I will bring on them, the citizens of Jerusalem, and the people of Judah all the disaster that I threatened to do to them. I will punish them because I threatened them but they still paid no heed.”’”
19875	24	36	32	Then Jeremiah got another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah. As Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on this scroll everything that had been on the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned in the fire. They also added on this scroll several other messages of the same kind.
19876	24	37	1	¶Zedekiah son of Josiah succeeded Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim as king. He was elevated to the throne of the land of Judah by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.
19877	24	37	2	Neither he nor the officials who served him nor the people of Judah paid any attention to what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said through the prophet Jeremiah.
19878	24	37	3	¶King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah to say, “Please pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God on our behalf.”
19879	24	37	4	(Now Jeremiah had not yet been put in prison. So he was still free to come and go among the people as he pleased.
19880	24	37	5	At that time the Babylonian forces had temporarily given up their siege against Jerusalem. They had had it under siege, but withdrew when they heard that the army of Pharaoh had set out from Egypt.)
19881	24	37	6	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to the prophet Jeremiah,
19882	24	37	7	“This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has said, ‘This is what you must say to the king of Judah who sent you to seek my help. “Beware, Pharaoh’s army that was on its way to help you is about to go back home to Egypt.
19883	24	37	8	Then the Babylonian forces will return. They will attack the city and will capture it and burn it down.
19884	24	37	9	Moreover, I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, warn you not to deceive yourselves into thinking that the Babylonian forces will go away and leave you alone. For they will not go away.
19885	24	37	10	For even if you were to defeat all the Babylonian forces fighting against you so badly that only wounded men were left lying in their tents, they would get up and burn this city down.”’”
19886	24	37	11	¶The following events also occurred while the Babylonian forces had temporarily withdrawn from Jerusalem because the army of Pharaoh was coming.
19887	24	37	12	Jeremiah started to leave Jerusalem to go to the territory of Benjamin. He wanted to make sure he got his share of the property that was being divided up among his family there.
19888	24	37	13	But he only got as far as the Benjamin Gate. There an officer in charge of the guards named Irijah, who was the son of Shelemiah and the grandson of Hananiah, stopped him. He seized Jeremiah and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!”
19889	24	37	14	Jeremiah answered, “That’s a lie! I am not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah would not listen to him. Irijah put Jeremiah under arrest and took him to the officials.
19890	24	37	15	The officials were very angry at Jeremiah. They had him flogged and put in prison in the house of Jonathan, the royal secretary, which they had converted into a place for confining prisoners.
19891	24	37	16	¶So Jeremiah was put in prison in a cell in the dungeon in Jonathan’s house. He was kept there for a long time.
19892	24	37	17	Then King Zedekiah had him brought to the palace. There he questioned him privately and asked him, “Is there any message from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?”Jeremiah answered, “Yes, there is.” Then he announced, “You will be handed over to the king of Babylon.”
19893	24	37	18	Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against you, or the officials who serve you, or the people of Judah? What have I done to make you people throw me into prison?
19894	24	37	19	Where now are the prophets who prophesied to you that the king of Babylon would not attack you or this land?
19895	24	37	20	But now please listen, your royal Majesty, and grant my plea for mercy. Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan, the royal secretary. If you do, I will die there.”
19896	24	37	21	Then King Zedekiah ordered that Jeremiah be committed to the courtyard of the guardhouse. He also ordered that a loaf of bread be given to him every day from the baker’s street until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah was kept in the courtyard of the guardhouse.
19897	24	38	1	¶Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah had heard the things that Jeremiah had been telling the people. They had heard him say,
19898	24	38	2	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘Those who stay in this city will die in battle or of starvation or disease. Those who leave the city and surrender to the Babylonians will live. They will escape with their lives.’”
19899	24	38	3	They had also heard him say, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon. They will capture it.’”
19900	24	38	4	So these officials said to the king, “This man must be put to death. For he is demoralizing the soldiers who are left in the city as well as all the other people there by these things he is saying. This man is not seeking to help these people but is trying to harm them.”
19901	24	38	5	King Zedekiah said to them, “Very well, you can do what you want with him. For I cannot do anything to stop you.”
19902	24	38	6	So the officials took Jeremiah and put him in the cistern of Malkijah, one of the royal princes, that was in the courtyard of the guardhouse. There was no water in the cistern, only mud. So when they lowered Jeremiah into the cistern with ropes he sank in the mud.
19903	24	38	7	¶An Ethiopian, Ebed Melech, a court official in the royal palace, heard that Jeremiah had been put in the cistern. While the king was holding court at the Benjamin Gate,
19904	24	38	8	Ebed Melech departed the palace and went to speak to the king. He said to him,
19905	24	38	9	“Your royal Majesty, those men have been very wicked in all that they have done to the prophet Jeremiah. They have thrown him into a cistern and he is sure to die of starvation there because there is no food left in the city.”
19906	24	38	10	Then the king gave Ebed Melech the Ethiopian the following order: “Take thirty men with you from here and go pull the prophet Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies.”
19907	24	38	11	So Ebed Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasure room in the palace. He got some worn-out clothes and old rags from there and let them down by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
19908	24	38	12	Ebed Melech called down to Jeremiah, “Put these rags and worn-out clothes under your armpits to pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did as Ebed Melech instructed.
19909	24	38	13	So they pulled Jeremiah up from the cistern with ropes. Jeremiah, however, still remained confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse.
19910	24	38	14	¶Some time later Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah brought to him at the third entrance of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple. The king said to Jeremiah, “I would like to ask you a question. Do not hide anything from me when you answer.”
19911	24	38	15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I answer you, you will certainly kill me. If I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”
19912	24	38	16	So King Zedekiah made a secret promise to Jeremiah and sealed it with an oath. He promised, “As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives who has given us life and breath, I promise you this: I will not kill you or hand you over to those men who want to kill you.”
19913	24	38	17	¶Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘You must surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon. If you do, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down. Indeed, you and your whole family will be spared.
19914	24	38	18	But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians and they will burn it down. You yourself will not escape from them.’”
19915	24	38	19	Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Babylonians. The Babylonians might hand me over to them and they will torture me.”
19916	24	38	20	Then Jeremiah answered, “You will not be handed over to them. Please obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> by doing what I have been telling you. Then all will go well with you and your life will be spared.
19917	24	38	21	But if you refuse to surrender, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has shown me a vision of what will happen. Here is what I saw:
19918	24	38	22	All the women who are left in the royal palace of Judah will be led out to the officers of the king of Babylon. They will taunt you saying, ‡‘Your trusted friends misled you; ‡they have gotten the best of you.‡Now that your feet are stuck in the mud,‡they have turned their backs on you.’
19919	24	38	23	¶“All your wives and your children will be turned over to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from them but will be captured by the king of Babylon. This city will be burned down.”
19920	24	38	24	¶Then Zedekiah told Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about the conversation we have had. If you do, you will die.
19921	24	38	25	The officials may hear that I have talked with you. They may come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you. Do not hide anything from us. If you do, we will kill you.’
19922	24	38	26	If they do this, tell them, ‘I was pleading with the king not to send me back to die in the dungeon of Jonathan’s house.’”
19923	24	38	27	All the officials did indeed come and question Jeremiah. He told them exactly what the king had instructed him to say. They stopped questioning him any further because no one had actually heard their conversation.
19924	24	38	28	So Jeremiah remained confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse until the day Jerusalem was captured.¶The following events occurred when Jerusalem was captured.
19925	24	39	1	¶King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it. The siege began in the tenth month of the ninth year that Zedekiah ruled over Judah.
19926	24	39	2	It lasted until the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year. On that day they broke through the city walls.
19927	24	39	3	Then Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim, who was a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer, who was a high official, and all the other officers of the king of Babylon came and set up quarters in the Middle Gate.
19928	24	39	4	When King Zedekiah of Judah and all his soldiers saw them, they tried to escape. They departed from the city during the night. They took a path through the king’s garden and passed out through the gate between the two walls. Then they headed for the rift valley.
19929	24	39	5	But the Babylonian army chased after them. They caught up with Zedekiah in the rift valley plains of Jericho and captured him. They took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon at Riblah in the territory of Hamath and Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him there.
19930	24	39	6	There at Riblah the king of Babylon had Zedekiah’s sons put to death while Zedekiah was forced to watch. The king of Babylon also had all the nobles of Judah put to death.
19931	24	39	7	Then he had Zedekiah’s eyes put out and had him bound in chains to be led off to Babylon.
19932	24	39	8	The Babylonians burned down the royal palace, the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the people’s homes, and they tore down the wall of Jerusalem.
19933	24	39	9	Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, took captive the rest of the people who were left in the city. He carried them off to Babylon along with the people who had deserted to him.
19934	24	39	10	But he left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing. He gave them fields and vineyards at that time.
19935	24	39	11	¶Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had issued orders concerning Jeremiah. He had passed them on through Nebuzaradan, the captain of his royal guard,
19936	24	39	12	“Find Jeremiah and look out for him. Do not do anything to harm him, but do with him whatever he tells you.”
19937	24	39	13	So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, Nebushazban, who was a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer, who was a high official, and all the other officers of the king of Babylon
19938	24	39	14	sent and had Jeremiah brought from the courtyard of the guardhouse. They turned him over to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and the grandson of Shaphan, to take him home with him. But Jeremiah stayed among the people.
19939	24	39	15	¶Now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message had come to Jeremiah while he was still confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse,
19940	24	39	16	“Go and tell Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, has said, “I will carry out against this city what I promised. It will mean disaster and not good fortune for it. When that disaster happens, you will be there to see it.
19941	24	39	17	But I will rescue you when it happens. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it! You will not be handed over to those whom you fear.
19942	24	39	18	I will certainly save you. You will not fall victim to violence. You will escape with your life because you trust in me. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!”’”
19943	24	40	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah after Nebuzaradan the captain of the royal guard had set him free at Ramah. He had taken him there in chains along with all the people from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried off to exile to Babylon.
19944	24	40	2	The captain of the royal guard took Jeremiah aside and said to him, “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God threatened this place with this disaster.
19945	24	40	3	Now he has brought it about. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has done just as he threatened to do. This disaster has happened because you people sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and did not obey him.
19946	24	40	4	But now, Jeremiah, today I will set you free from the chains on your wrists. If you would like to come to Babylon with me, come along and I will take care of you. But if you prefer not to come to Babylon with me, you are not required to do so. You are free to go anywhere in the land you want to go. Go wherever you choose.”
19947	24	40	5	Before Jeremiah could turn to leave, the captain of the guard added, “Go back to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed to govern the towns of Judah. Go back and live with him among the people. Or go wherever else you choose.” Then the captain of the guard gave Jeremiah some food and a present and let him go.
19948	24	40	6	So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and lived there with him. He stayed there to live among the people who had been left in the land of Judah.
19949	24	40	7	¶Now some of the officers of the Judean army and their troops had been hiding in the countryside. They heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam to govern the country. They also heard that he had been put in charge over the men, women, and children from the poorer classes of the land who had not been carried off into exile in Babylon.
19950	24	40	8	So all these officers and their troops came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The officers who came were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite.
19951	24	40	9	Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, took an oath so as to give them and their troops some assurance of safety. “Do not be afraid to submit to the Babylonians. Settle down in the land and submit to the king of Babylon. Then things will go well for you.
19952	24	40	10	I for my part will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians whenever they come to us. You for your part go ahead and harvest the wine, the dates, the figs, and the olive oil, and store them in jars. Go ahead and settle down in the towns that you have taken over.”
19953	24	40	11	Moreover, all the Judeans who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and all the other countries heard what had happened. They heard that the king of Babylon had allowed some people to stay in Judah and that he had appointed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to govern them.
19954	24	40	12	So all these Judeans returned to the land of Judah from the places where they had been scattered. They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Thus they harvested a large amount of wine and dates and figs.
19955	24	40	13	¶Johanan and all the officers of the troops that had been hiding in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah.
19956	24	40	14	They said to him, “Are you at all aware that King Baalis of Ammon has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to kill you?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them.
19957	24	40	15	Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah there at Mizpah, “Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah before anyone knows about it. Otherwise he will kill you and all the Judeans who have rallied around you will be scattered. Then what remains of Judah will disappear.”
19958	24	40	16	But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Do not do that because what you are saying about Ishmael is not true.”
19959	24	41	1	¶But in the seventh month Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama who was a member of the royal family and had been one of Zedekiah’s chief officers, came with ten of his men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating a meal together with him there at Mizpah,
19960	24	41	2	Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him stood up, pulled out their swords, and killed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. Thus Ishmael killed the man that the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the country.
19961	24	41	3	Ishmael also killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Babylonian soldiers who happened to be there.
19962	24	41	4	¶On the day after Gedaliah had been murdered, before anyone even knew about it,
19963	24	41	5	eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves to show they were mourning. They were carrying grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in Jerusalem.
19964	24	41	6	Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them. He was pretending to cry as he walked along. When he met them, he said to them, “Come with me to meet Gedaliah son of Ahikam.”
19965	24	41	7	But as soon as they were inside the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw their bodies in a cistern.
19966	24	41	8	But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us. For we will give you the stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey we have hidden in a field.” So he spared their lives and did not kill them along with the rest.
19967	24	41	9	Now the cistern where Ishmael threw all the dead bodies of those he had killed was a large one that King Asa had constructed as part of his defenses against King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with dead bodies.
19968	24	41	10	Then Ishmael took captive all the people who were still left alive in Mizpah. This included the royal princesses and all the rest of the people in Mizpah that Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, had put under the authority of Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took all these people captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
19969	24	41	11	¶Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the atrocities that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed.
19970	24	41	12	So they took all their troops and went to fight against Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the large pool at Gibeon.
19971	24	41	13	When all the people that Ishmael had taken captive saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers with him, they were glad.
19972	24	41	14	All those people that Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah.
19973	24	41	15	But Ishmael son of Nethaniah managed to escape from Johanan along with eight of his men, and he went on over to Ammon.
19974	24	41	16	¶Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led off all the people who had been left alive at Mizpah. They had rescued them from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after he killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. They led off the men, women, children, soldiers, and court officials whom they had brought away from Gibeon.
19975	24	41	17	They set out to go to Egypt to get away from the Babylonians, but stopped at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem.
19976	24	41	18	They were afraid of what the Babylonians might do because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the country.
19977	24	42	1	¶Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah and all the people of every class, went to the prophet Jeremiah.
19978	24	42	2	They said to him, “Please grant our request and pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God for all those of us who are still left alive here. For, as you yourself can see, there are only a few of us left out of the many there were before.
19979	24	42	3	Pray that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do.”
19980	24	42	4	The prophet Jeremiah answered them, “Agreed! I will indeed pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God as you have asked. I will tell you everything the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> replies in response to you. I will not keep anything back from you.”
19981	24	42	5	They answered Jeremiah, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not do just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God sends you to tell us to do.
19982	24	42	6	We will obey what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God to whom we are sending you tells us to do. It does not matter whether we like what he tells us or not. We will obey what he tells us to do so that things will go well for us.”
19983	24	42	7	¶Ten days later the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah.
19984	24	42	8	So Jeremiah summoned Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people of every class.
19985	24	42	9	Then Jeremiah said to them, “You sent me to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel to make your request known to him. Here is what he says to you:
19986	24	42	10	‘If you will just stay in this land, I will build you up. I will not tear you down. I will firmly plant you. I will not uproot you. For I am filled with sorrow because of the disaster that I have brought on you.
19987	24	42	11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him because I will be with you to save you and to rescue you from his power. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!
19988	24	42	12	I will have compassion on you so that he in turn will have mercy on you and allow you to return to your land.’
19989	24	42	13	¶“You must not disobey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God by saying, ‘We will not stay in this land.’
19990	24	42	14	You must not say, ‘No, we will not stay. Instead we will go and live in the land of Egypt where we will not face war, or hear the enemy’s trumpet calls, or starve for lack of food.’
19991	24	42	15	If you people who remain in Judah do that, then listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message. This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel has said, ‘If you are so determined to go to Egypt that you go and settle there,
19992	24	42	16	the wars you fear will catch up with you there in the land of Egypt. The starvation you are worried about will follow you there to Egypt. You will die there.
19993	24	42	17	All the people who are determined to go and settle in Egypt will die from war, starvation, or disease. No one will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.’
19994	24	42	18	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘If you go to Egypt, I will pour out my wrath on you just as I poured out my anger and wrath on the citizens of Jerusalem. You will become an object of horror and ridicule, an example of those who have been cursed and that people use in pronouncing a curse. You will never see this place again.’
19995	24	42	19	¶“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has told you people who remain in Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Be very sure of this: I warn you here and now.
19996	24	42	20	You are making a fatal mistake. For you sent me to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God and asked me, ‘Pray to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God for us. Tell us what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God says and we will do it.’
19997	24	42	21	This day I have told you what he said. But you do not want to obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God by doing what he sent me to tell you.
19998	24	42	22	So now be very sure of this: You will die from war, starvation, or disease in the place where you want to go and live.”
19999	24	43	1	¶Jeremiah finished telling all the people all these things the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God had sent him to tell them.
20000	24	43	2	Then Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and other arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God did not send you to tell us, ‘You must not go to Egypt and settle there.’
20001	24	43	3	But Baruch son of Neriah is stirring you up against us. He wants to hand us over to the Babylonians so that they will kill us or carry us off into exile in Babylon.”
20002	24	43	4	So Johanan son of Kareah, all the army officers, and all the rest of the people did not obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s command to stay in the land of Judah.
20003	24	43	5	Instead Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led off all the Judean remnant who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered.
20004	24	43	6	They also led off all the men, women, children, and royal princesses that Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, had left with Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. This included the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch son of Neriah.
20005	24	43	7	They went on to Egypt because they refused to obey the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and came to Tahpanhes.
20006	24	43	8	¶At Tahpanhes the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jeremiah.
20007	24	43	9	“Take some large stones and bury them in the mortar of the clay pavement at the entrance of Pharaoh’s residence here in Tahpanhes. Do it while the people of Judah present there are watching.
20008	24	43	10	Then tell them, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, “I will bring my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I will set his throne over these stones which I have buried. He will pitch his royal tent over them.
20009	24	43	11	He will come and attack Egypt. Those who are destined to die of disease will die of disease. Those who are destined to be carried off into exile will be carried off into exile. Those who are destined to die in war will die in war.
20010	24	43	12	He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt. He will burn their gods or carry them off as captives. He will pick Egypt clean like a shepherd picks the lice from his clothing. He will leave there unharmed.
20011	24	43	13	He will demolish the sacred pillars in the temple of the sun in Egypt and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.”’”
20012	24	44	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who were living in the land of Egypt, those in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in the region of southern Egypt.
20013	24	44	2	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘You have seen all the disaster I brought on Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah. Indeed, they now lie in ruins and are deserted.
20014	24	44	3	This happened because of the wickedness the people living there did. They made me angry by worshiping and offering sacrifice to other gods whom neither they nor you nor your ancestors previously knew.
20015	24	44	4	I sent my servants the prophets to you people over and over again warning you not to do this disgusting thing I hate.
20016	24	44	5	But the people of Jerusalem and Judah would not listen or pay any attention. They would not stop the wickedness they were doing nor quit sacrificing to other gods.
20017	24	44	6	So my anger and my wrath were poured out and burned like a fire through the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. That is why they have become the desolate ruins that they are today.’
20018	24	44	7	¶“So now the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, asks, ‘Why will you do such great harm to yourselves? Why should every man, woman, child, and baby of yours be destroyed from the midst of Judah? Why should you leave yourselves without a remnant?
20019	24	44	8	That is what will result from your making me angry by what you are doing. You are making me angry by sacrificing to other gods here in the land of Egypt where you live. You will be destroyed for doing that! You will become an example used in curses and an object of ridicule among all the nations of the earth.
20020	24	44	9	Have you forgotten all the wicked things that have been done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem by your ancestors, by the kings of Judah and their wives, by you and your wives?
20021	24	44	10	To this day your people have shown no contrition! They have not revered me nor followed the laws and statutes I commanded you and your ancestors.’
20022	24	44	11	¶“Because of this, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘I am determined to bring disaster on you, even to the point of destroying all the Judeans here.
20023	24	44	12	I will see to it that all the Judean remnant that was determined to go and live in the land of Egypt will be destroyed. Here in the land of Egypt they will fall in battle or perish from starvation. People of every class will die in war or from starvation. They will become an object of horror and ridicule, an example of those who have been cursed and that people use in pronouncing a curse.
20024	24	44	13	I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt with war, starvation, and disease just as I punished Jerusalem.
20025	24	44	14	None of the Judean remnant who have come to live in the land of Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah. Though they long to return and live there, none of them shall return except a few fugitives.’”
20026	24	44	15	¶Then all the men who were aware that their wives were sacrificing to other gods, as well as all their wives, answered Jeremiah. There was a great crowd of them representing all the people who lived in northern and southern Egypt. They answered,
20027	24	44	16	“We will not listen to what you claim the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken to us!
20028	24	44	17	Instead we will do everything we vowed we would do. We will sacrifice and pour out drink offerings to the goddess called the Queen of Heaven just as we and our ancestors, our kings, and our leaders previously did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, were well-off, and had no troubles.
20029	24	44	18	But ever since we stopped sacrificing and pouring out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven, we have been in great need. Our people have died in wars or of starvation.”
20030	24	44	19	The women added, “We did indeed sacrifice and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven. But it was with the full knowledge and approval of our husbands that we made cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her.”
20031	24	44	20	¶Then Jeremiah replied to all the people, both men and women, who responded to him in this way.
20032	24	44	21	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> did indeed remember and call to mind what you did! He remembered the sacrifices you and your ancestors, your kings, your leaders, and all the rest of the people of the land offered to other gods in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem.
20033	24	44	22	Finally the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> could no longer endure your wicked deeds and the disgusting things you did. That is why your land has become the desolate, uninhabited ruin that it is today. That is why it has become a proverbial example used in curses.
20034	24	44	23	You have sacrificed to other gods! You have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! You have not obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! You have not followed his laws, his statutes, and his decrees! That is why this disaster that is evident to this day has happened to you.”
20035	24	44	24	¶Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people, particularly to all the women. “Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message, all you people of Judah who are in Egypt.
20036	24	44	25	This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘You women have confirmed by your actions what you vowed with your lips! You said, “We will certainly carry out our vows to sacrifice and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.” Well, then fulfill your vows! Carry them out!’
20037	24	44	26	But listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message, all you people of Judah who are living in the land of Egypt. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘I hereby swear by my own great name that none of the people of Judah who are living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name in their oaths! Never again will any of them use it in an oath saying, “As surely as the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives….”
20038	24	44	27	I will indeed see to it that disaster, not prosperity, happens to them. All the people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will die in war or from starvation until not one of them is left.
20039	24	44	28	Some who survive in battle will return to the land of Judah from the land of Egypt. But they will be very few indeed! Then the Judean remnant who have come to live in the land of Egypt will know whose word proves true, mine or theirs.’
20040	24	44	29	Moreover the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘I will make something happen to prove that I will punish you in this place. I will do it so that you will know that my threats to bring disaster on you will prove true.
20041	24	44	30	I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, promise that I will hand Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt over to his enemies who are seeking to kill him. I will do that just as surely as I handed King Zedekiah of Judah over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, his enemy who was seeking to kill him.’”
20042	24	45	1	¶The prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah while he was writing down in a scroll the words that Jeremiah spoke to him. This happened in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.
20043	24	45	2	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel has a message for you, Baruch.
20044	24	45	3	‘You have said, “I feel so hopeless! For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has added sorrow to my suffering. I am worn out from groaning. I can’t find any rest.”’”
20045	24	45	4	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> told Jeremiah, “Tell Baruch, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “I am about to tear down what I have built and to uproot what I have planted. I will do this throughout the whole earth.
20046	24	45	5	Are you looking for great things for yourself? Do not look for such things. For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that I am about to bring disaster on all humanity. But I will allow you to escape with your life wherever you go.”’”
20047	24	46	1	¶This was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message to the prophet Jeremiah about the nations.
20048	24	46	2	¶He spoke about Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt which was encamped along the Euphrates River at Carchemish. Now this was the army that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon defeated in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.
20049	24	46	3	‡“Fall into ranks with your shields ready! ‡Prepare to march into battle!
20050	24	46	4	‡Harness the horses to the chariots!‡Mount your horses!‡Take your positions with helmets on!‡Ready your spears!‡Put on the armor!
20051	24	46	5	‡“What do I see! ‡The soldiers are frightened.‡They are retreating.‡They are being scattered. ‡They have fled for refuge‡without looking back. ‡Terror is all around them,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.

20054	24	46	8	‡Egypt rises like the Nile,‡like its streams turbulent at flood stage.‡Egypt said, ‘I will arise and cover the earth.‡I will destroy cities and the people who inhabit them.’
20055	24	46	9	‡Go ahead and charge into battle, you horsemen!‡Drive furiously, you charioteers!‡Let the soldiers march out into battle,‡those from Ethiopia and Libya who carry shields,‡and those from Lydia who are armed with the bow.

20057	24	46	11	‡Go up to Gilead and get medicinal ointment, ‡you dear poor people of Egypt. ‡But it will prove useless no matter how much medicine you use; ‡there will be no healing for you.

20059	24	46	13	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to the prophet Jeremiah about Nebuchadnezzar coming to attack the land of Egypt.
20060	24	46	14	‡“Make an announcement throughout Egypt.‡Proclaim it in Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpanhes. ‡‘Take your positions and prepare to do battle.‡For the enemy army is destroying all the nations around you.’

20062	24	46	16	‡I will make many stumble. ‡They will fall over one another in their hurry to flee. ‡They will say, ‘Get up! ‡Let’s go back to our own people.‡Let’s go back to our homelands‡because the enemy is coming to destroy us.’
20063	24	46	17	‡There at home they will say, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is just a big noise! ‡He has let the most opportune moment pass by.’
20064	24	46	18	‡I the King, whose name is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, swear this:‡I swear as surely as I live that a conqueror is coming.‡He will be as imposing as Mount Tabor is among the mountains,‡as Mount Carmel is against the backdrop of the sea.
20065	24	46	19	‡Pack your bags for exile,‡you inhabitants of poor dear Egypt. ‡For Memphis will be laid waste.‡It will lie in ruins and be uninhabited.
20066	24	46	20	‡Egypt is like a beautiful young cow.‡But northern armies will attack her like swarms of stinging flies.
20067	24	46	21	‡Even her mercenaries ‡will prove to be like pampered, well-fed calves.‡For they too will turn and run away.‡They will not stand their ground ‡when the time for them to be destroyed comes,‡the time for them to be punished.
20068	24	46	22	‡Egypt will run away, hissing like a snake, ‡as the enemy comes marching up in force.‡They will come against her with axes‡as if they were woodsmen chopping down trees.
20069	24	46	23	‡The population of Egypt is like a vast, impenetrable forest.‡But I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that the enemy will cut them down.‡For those who chop them down will be more numerous than locusts.‡They will be too numerous to count.
20070	24	46	24	‡Poor dear Egypt will be put to shame.‡She will be handed over to the people from the north.”
20071	24	46	25	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, “I will punish Amon, the god of Thebes. I will punish Egypt, its gods, and its kings. I will punish Pharaoh and all who trust in him.
20072	24	46	26	I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar and his troops, who want to kill them. But later on, people will live in Egypt again as they did in former times. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!”
20073	24	46	27	‡“You descendants of Jacob, my servants, do not be afraid;‡do not be terrified, people of Israel.‡For I will rescue you and your descendants‡from the faraway lands where you are captives. ‡The descendants of Jacob will return to their land and enjoy peace.‡They will be secure and no one will terrify them.

20075	24	47	1	¶This was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message to the prophet Jeremiah about the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza.
20076	24	47	2	‡“Look! Enemies are gathering in the north like water rising in a river. ‡They will be like an overflowing stream.‡They will overwhelm the whole country and everything in it like a flood.‡They will overwhelm the cities and their inhabitants.‡People will cry out in alarm.‡Everyone living in the country will cry out in pain.
20077	24	47	3	‡Fathers will hear the hoofbeats of the enemies’ horses,‡the clatter of their chariots and the rumbling of their wheels.‡They will not turn back to save their children‡because they will be paralyzed with fear.

20088	24	48	7	‡“Moab, you trust in the things you do and in your riches.‡So you too will be conquered.‡Your god Chemosh will go into exile ‡along with his priests and his officials.

20130	24	49	2	‡Because you did that, ‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm that a time is coming‡when I will make Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon,‡hear the sound of the battle cry.‡It will become a mound covered with ruins. ‡Its villages will be burned to the ground. ‡Then Israel will take back its land ‡from those who took their land from them.‡I, the Lord, affirm it!
20131	24	49	3	‡Wail, you people in Heshbon, because Ai in Ammon is destroyed.‡Cry out in anguish, you people in the villages surrounding Rabbah.‡Put on sackcloth and cry out in mourning.‡Run about covered with gashes. ‡For your god Milcom will go into exile‡along with his priests and officials.
20132	24	49	4	‡Why do you brag about your great power?‡Your power is ebbing away, you rebellious people of Ammon, ‡who trust in your riches and say,‡‘Who would dare to attack us?’
20133	24	49	5	‡I will bring terror on you from every side,”‡says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. ‡“You will be scattered in every direction. ‡No one will gather the fugitives back together.
20134	24	49	6	‡Yet in days to come ‡I will reverse Ammon’s ill fortune.” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20135	24	49	7	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies spoke about Edom. ‡“Is wisdom no longer to be found in Teman? ‡Can Edom’s counselors not give her any good advice? ‡Has all of their wisdom turned bad?
20136	24	49	8	‡Turn and flee! Take up refuge in remote places, ‡you people who live in Dedan. ‡For I will bring disaster on the descendants of Esau.‡I have decided it is time for me to punish them.
20137	24	49	9	‡If grape pickers came to pick your grapes,‡would they not leave a few grapes behind? ‡If robbers came at night,‡would they not pillage only what they needed?
20138	24	49	10	‡But I will strip everything away from Esau’s descendants.‡I will uncover their hiding places so they cannot hide.‡Their children, relatives, and neighbors will all be destroyed.‡Not one of them will be left!
20139	24	49	11	‡Leave your orphans behind and I will keep them alive.‡Your widows too can depend on me.”
20140	24	49	12	¶For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “If even those who did not deserve to drink from the cup of my wrath must drink from it, do you think you will go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but must certainly drink from the cup of my wrath.
20141	24	49	13	For I solemnly swear,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “that Bozrah will become a pile of ruins. It will become an object of horror and ridicule, an example to be used in curses. All the towns around it will lie in ruins forever.”
20142	24	49	14	‡I said, “I have heard a message from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡A messenger has been sent among the nations to say,‡‘Gather your armies and march out against her!‡Prepare to do battle with her!’”
20143	24	49	15	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to Edom, ‡“I will certainly make you small among nations.‡I will make you despised by all humankind.
20144	24	49	16	‡The terror you inspire in others ‡and the arrogance of your heart have deceived you.‡You may make your home in the clefts of the rocks;‡you may occupy the highest places in the hills. ‡But even if you made your home where the eagles nest,‡I would bring you down from there,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20145	24	49	17	‡“Edom will become an object of horror.‡All who pass by it will be filled with horror; ‡they will hiss out their scorn ‡because of all the disasters that have happened to it.
20146	24	49	18	‡Edom will be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah‡and the towns that were around them.‡No one will live there.‡No human being will settle in it,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20147	24	49	19	‡“A lion coming up from the thick undergrowth along the Jordan ‡scatters the sheep in the pastureland around it. ‡So too I will chase the Edomites off their land. ‡Then I will appoint over it whomever I choose. ‡For there is no one like me, and there is no one who can call me to account. ‡There is no ruler who can stand up against me.
20148	24	49	20	‡So listen to what I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have planned against Edom,‡what I intend to do to the people who live in Teman. ‡Their little ones will be dragged off.‡I will completely destroy their land because of what they have done.
20149	24	49	21	‡The people of the earth will quake when they hear of their downfall. ‡Their cries of anguish will be heard all the way to the Gulf of Aqaba.
20150	24	49	22	‡Look! Like an eagle with outspread wings,‡a nation will soar up and swoop down on Bozrah.‡At that time the soldiers of Edom will be as fearful ‡as a woman in labor.”
20151	24	49	23	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke about Damascus. ‡“The people of Hamath and Arpad will be dismayed‡because they have heard bad news.‡Their courage will melt away because of worry.‡Their hearts will not be able to rest.
20152	24	49	24	‡The people of Damascus will lose heart and turn to flee.‡Panic will grip them.‡Pain and anguish will seize them‡like a woman in labor.
20153	24	49	25	‡How deserted will that once-famous city be,‡that city that was once filled with joy!
20154	24	49	26	‡For her young men will fall in her city squares.‡All her soldiers will be destroyed at that time,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
20155	24	49	27	‡“I will set fire to the walls of Damascus;‡it will burn up the palaces of Ben Hadad.”
20156	24	49	28	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke about Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquered. ‡“Army of Babylon, go and attack Kedar.‡Lay waste those who live in the eastern desert.
20157	24	49	29	‡Their tents and their flocks will be taken away.‡Their tent curtains, equipment, and camels will be carried off.‡People will shout to them,‡‘Terror is all around you!’”
20158	24	49	30	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “Flee quickly, you who live in Hazor. ‡Take up refuge in remote places. ‡For King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has laid out plans to attack you.‡He has formed his strategy on how to defeat you.”
20159	24	49	31	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “Army of Babylon, go and attack‡a nation that lives in peace and security.‡They have no gates or walls to protect them. ‡They live all alone.
20160	24	49	32	‡Their camels will be taken as plunder.‡Their vast herds will be taken as spoil.‡I will scatter to the four winds‡those desert peoples who cut their hair short at the temples. ‡I will bring disaster against them‡from every direction,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20161	24	49	33	‡“Hazor will become a permanent wasteland,‡a place where only jackals live. ‡No one will live there.‡No human being will settle in it.”
20162	24	49	34	¶This was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message to the prophet Jeremiah about Elam, which came early in the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah.
20163	24	49	35	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies said,‡“I will kill all the archers of Elam,‡who are the chief source of her military might.
20164	24	49	36	‡I will cause enemies to blow through Elam from every direction‡like the winds blowing in from the four quarters of heaven.‡I will scatter the people of Elam to the four winds.‡There will not be any nation where the refugees of Elam will not go.
20165	24	49	37	‡I will make the people of Elam terrified of their enemies,‡who are seeking to kill them.‡I will vent my fierce anger‡and bring disaster upon them,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‡“I will send armies chasing after them ‡until I have completely destroyed them.
20166	24	49	38	‡I will establish my sovereignty over Elam. ‡I will destroy their king and their leaders,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20167	24	49	39	‡“Yet in days to come ‡I will reverse Elam’s ill fortune,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20168	24	50	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke concerning Babylon and the land of Babylonia through the prophet Jeremiah.
20169	24	50	2	‡“Announce the news among the nations! Proclaim it!‡Signal for people to pay attention! ‡Declare the news! Do not hide it! Say:‡‘Babylon will be captured.‡Bel will be put to shame.‡Marduk will be dismayed.‡Babylon’s idols will be put to shame.‡Her disgusting images will be dismayed.
20170	24	50	3	‡For a nation from the north will attack Babylon.‡It will lay her land waste.‡People and animals will flee out of it.‡No one will inhabit it.’
20171	24	50	4	‡“When that time comes,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡“the people of Israel and Judah will return to the land together.‡They will come back with tears of repentance‡as they seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God.
20172	24	50	5	‡They will ask the way to Zion;‡they will turn their faces toward it.‡They will come and bind themselves to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡in a lasting covenant that will never be forgotten.
20173	24	50	6	‡“My people have been lost sheep.‡Their shepherds have allowed them to go astray.‡They have wandered around in the mountains.‡They have roamed from one mountain and hill to another. ‡They have forgotten their resting place.
20174	24	50	7	‡All who encountered them devoured them.‡Their enemies who did this said, ‘We are not liable for punishment!‡For those people have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, their true pasture. ‡They have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in whom their ancestors trusted.’
20175	24	50	8	‡“People of Judah, get out of Babylon quickly!‡Leave the land of Babylonia! ‡Be the first to depart! ‡Be like the male goats that lead the herd.
20176	24	50	9	‡For I will rouse into action and bring against Babylon‡a host of mighty nations from the land of the north.‡They will set up their battle lines against her.‡They will come from the north and capture her. ‡Their arrows will be like a skilled soldier ‡who does not return from the battle empty-handed.
20177	24	50	10	‡Babylonia will be plundered.‡Those who plunder it will take all they want,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20178	24	50	11	‡“People of Babylonia, you plundered my people. ‡That made you happy and glad.‡You frolic about like calves in a pasture. ‡Your joyous sounds are like the neighs of a stallion.
20179	24	50	12	‡But Babylonia will be put to great shame.‡The land where you were born will be disgraced.‡Indeed, Babylonia will become the least important of all nations.‡It will become a dry and barren desert.
20180	24	50	13	‡After I vent my wrath on it Babylon will be uninhabited. ‡It will be totally desolate.‡All who pass by will be filled with horror and will hiss out their scorn ‡because of all the disasters that have happened to it.
20181	24	50	14	‡“Take up your battle positions all around Babylon,‡all you soldiers who are armed with bows. ‡Shoot all your arrows at her! Do not hold any back! ‡For she has sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20182	24	50	15	‡Shout the battle cry from all around the city.‡She will throw up her hands in surrender. ‡Her towers will fall.‡Her walls will be torn down.‡Because I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, am wreaking revenge, ‡take out your vengeance on her!‡Do to her as she has done!
20183	24	50	16	‡Kill all the farmers who sow the seed in the land of Babylon.‡Kill all those who wield the sickle at harvest time. ‡Let all the foreigners return to their own people.‡Let them hurry back to their own lands ‡to escape destruction by that enemy army.
20184	24	50	17	‡“The people of Israel are like scattered sheep‡which lions have chased away.‡First the king of Assyria devoured them. ‡Now last of all King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has gnawed their bones.
20185	24	50	18	‡So I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, say: ‡‘I will punish the king of Babylon and his land‡just as I punished the king of Assyria.
20186	24	50	19	‡But I will restore the flock of Israel to their own pasture.‡They will graze on Mount Carmel and the land of Bashan.‡They will eat until they are full ‡on the hills of Ephraim and the land of Gilead.
20187	24	50	20	‡When that time comes,‡no guilt will be found in Israel.‡No sin will be found in Judah. ‡For I will forgive those of them I have allowed to survive. ‡I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, affirm it!’”
20188	24	50	21	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‡“Attack the land of Merathaim‡and the people who live in Pekod! ‡Pursue, kill, and completely destroy them! ‡Do just as I have commanded you!
20189	24	50	22	‡The noise of battle can be heard in the land of Babylonia. ‡There is the sound of great destruction.
20190	24	50	23	‡Babylon hammered the whole world to pieces.‡But see how that ‘hammer’ has been broken and shattered! ‡See what an object of horror ‡Babylon has become among the nations!
20191	24	50	24	‡I set a trap for you, Babylon;‡you were caught before you knew it.‡You fought against me.‡So you were found and captured.
20192	24	50	25	‡I have opened up the place where my weapons are stored. ‡I have brought out the weapons for carrying out my wrath. ‡For I, the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‡have work to carry out in the land of Babylonia.
20193	24	50	26	‡Come from far away and attack Babylonia! ‡Open up the places where she stores her grain!‡Pile her up in ruins! Destroy her completely! ‡Do not leave anyone alive!
20194	24	50	27	‡Kill all her soldiers! ‡Let them be slaughtered! ‡They are doomed, for their day of reckoning has come,‡the time for them to be punished.”
20195	24	50	28	‡Listen! Fugitives and refugees are coming from the land of Babylon.‡They are coming to Zion to declare there‡how the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God is getting revenge,‡getting revenge for what they have done to his temple.
20196	24	50	29	‡“Call for archers to come against Babylon!‡Summon against her all who draw the bow!‡Set up camp all around the city!‡Do not allow anyone to escape!‡Pay her back for what she has done.‡Do to her what she has done to others.‡For she has proudly defied me, ‡the Holy One of Israel.
20197	24	50	30	‡So her young men will fall in her city squares.‡All her soldiers will be destroyed at that time,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20198	24	50	31	‡“Listen! I am opposed to you, you proud city,” ‡says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. ‡“Indeed, your day of reckoning has come,‡the time when I will punish you.
20199	24	50	32	‡You will stumble and fall, you proud city;‡no one will help you get up.‡I will set fire to your towns;‡it will burn up everything that surrounds you.”
20200	24	50	33	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says,‡“The people of Israel are oppressed.‡So too are the people of Judah. ‡All those who took them captive are holding them prisoners.‡They refuse to set them free.
20201	24	50	34	‡But the one who will rescue them is strong.‡His name is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. ‡He will strongly champion their cause.‡As a result he will bring peace and rest to the earth,‡but trouble and turmoil to the people who inhabit Babylonia.
20202	24	50	35	‡“Destructive forces will come against the Babylonians,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‡“They will come against the people who inhabit Babylonia,‡against her leaders and her men of wisdom.
20203	24	50	36	‡Destructive forces will come against her false prophets; ‡they will be shown to be fools! ‡Destructive forces will come against her soldiers;‡they will be filled with terror!
20204	24	50	37	‡Destructive forces will come against her horses and her chariots.‡Destructive forces will come against all the foreign troops within her; ‡they will be as frightened as women! ‡Destructive forces will come against her treasures;‡they will be taken away as plunder!
20205	24	50	38	‡A drought will come upon her land;‡her rivers and canals will be dried up. ‡All of this will happen because her land is filled with idols. ‡Her people act like madmen because of those idols they fear.
20206	24	50	39	‡Therefore desert creatures and jackals will live there.‡Ostriches will dwell in it too. ‡But no people will ever live there again.‡No one will dwell there for all time to come.
20207	24	50	40	‡I will destroy Babylonia just like I did‡Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring towns.‡No one will live there. ‡No human being will settle in it,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20208	24	50	41	‡“Look! An army is about to come from the north.‡A mighty nation and many kings are stirring into action ‡in faraway parts of the earth.

20210	24	50	43	‡The king of Babylon will become paralyzed with fear ‡when he hears news of their coming. ‡Anguish will grip him,‡agony like that of a woman giving birth to a baby.

20213	24	50	46	‡The people of the earth will quake when they hear Babylon has been captured.‡Her cries of anguish will be heard by the other nations.”
20214	24	51	1	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“I will cause a destructive wind to blow‡against Babylon and the people who inhabit Babylonia.

20216	24	51	3	‡Do not give her archers time to string their bows‡or to put on their coats of armor. ‡Do not spare any of her young men.‡Completely destroy her whole army.
20217	24	51	4	‡Let them fall slain in the land of Babylonia, ‡mortally wounded in the streets of her cities.
20218	24	51	5	‡“For Israel and Judah will not be forsaken ‡by their God, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. ‡For the land of Babylonia is full of guilt‡against the Holy One of Israel.
20219	24	51	6	‡Get out of Babylonia quickly, you foreign people. ‡Flee to save your lives.‡Do not let yourselves be killed because of her sins.‡For it is time for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to wreak his revenge.‡He will pay Babylonia back for what she has done.
20220	24	51	7	‡Babylonia had been a gold cup in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s hand.‡She had made the whole world drunk.‡The nations had drunk from the wine of her wrath. ‡So they have all gone mad.
20221	24	51	8	‡But suddenly Babylonia will fall and be destroyed. ‡Cry out in mourning over it!‡Get medicine for her wounds!‡Perhaps she can be healed!
20222	24	51	9	‡Foreigners living there will say, ‡‘We tried to heal her, but she could not be healed.‡Let’s leave Babylonia and each go back to his own country.‡For judgment on her will be vast in its proportions.‡It will be like it is piled up to heaven, stacked up into the clouds.’

20224	24	51	11	‡“Sharpen your arrows!‡Fill your quivers! ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will arouse a spirit of hostility in the kings of Media. ‡For he intends to destroy Babylonia.‡For that is how the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will get his revenge – ‡how he will get his revenge for the Babylonians’ destruction of his temple.

20249	24	51	36	‡Therefore the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“I will stand up for your cause.‡I will pay the Babylonians back for what they have done to you. ‡I will dry up their sea.‡I will make their springs run dry.
20250	24	51	37	‡Babylon will become a heap of ruins.‡Jackals will make their home there. ‡It will become an object of horror and of hissing scorn,‡a place where no one lives.
20251	24	51	38	‡The Babylonians are all like lions roaring for prey.‡They are like lion cubs growling for something to eat.
20252	24	51	39	‡When their appetites are all stirred up, ‡I will set out a banquet for them.‡I will make them drunk‡so that they will pass out, ‡they will fall asleep forever,‡they will never wake up,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20253	24	51	40	‡“I will lead them off to be slaughtered‡like lambs, rams, and male goats.”
20254	24	51	41	‡“See how Babylon has been captured!‡See how the pride of the whole earth has been taken!‡See what an object of horror‡Babylon has become among the nations!
20255	24	51	42	‡The sea has swept over Babylon.‡She has been covered by a multitude of its waves.
20256	24	51	43	‡The towns of Babylonia have become heaps of ruins.‡She has become a dry and barren desert. ‡No one lives in those towns any more.‡No one even passes through them.
20257	24	51	44	‡I will punish the god Bel in Babylon.‡I will make him spit out what he has swallowed.‡The nations will not come streaming to him any longer.‡Indeed, the walls of Babylon will fall.”
20258	24	51	45	‡“Get out of Babylon, my people!‡Flee to save your lives‡from the fierce anger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!
20259	24	51	46	‡Do not lose your courage or become afraid‡because of the reports that are heard in the land.‡For a report will come in one year.‡Another report will follow it in the next.‡There will be violence in the land‡with ruler fighting against ruler.”
20260	24	51	47	‡“So the time will certainly come ‡when I will punish the idols of Babylon.‡Her whole land will be put to shame.‡All her mortally wounded will collapse in her midst.
20261	24	51	48	‡Then heaven and earth and all that is in them‡will sing for joy over Babylon.‡For destroyers from the north will attack it,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20262	24	51	49	‡“Babylon must fall ‡because of the Israelites she has killed, ‡just as the earth’s mortally wounded fell‡because of Babylon.
20263	24	51	50	‡You who have escaped the sword, ‡go, do not delay. ‡Remember the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in a faraway land.‡Think about Jerusalem.
20264	24	51	51	‡‘We are ashamed because we have been insulted. ‡Our faces show our disgrace. ‡For foreigners have invaded ‡the holy rooms in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.’
20265	24	51	52	‡Yes, but the time will certainly come,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡“when I will punish her idols.‡Throughout her land the mortally wounded will groan.
20266	24	51	53	‡Even if Babylon climbs high into the sky ‡and fortifies her elevated stronghold, ‡I will send destroyers against her,” ‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20267	24	51	54	‡Cries of anguish will come from Babylon,‡the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians.
20268	24	51	55	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is ready to destroy Babylon,‡and put an end to her loud noise.‡Their waves will roar like turbulent waters.‡They will make a deafening noise.
20269	24	51	56	‡For a destroyer is attacking Babylon. ‡Her warriors will be captured;‡their bows will be broken. ‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is a God who punishes; ‡he pays back in full.
20270	24	51	57	‡“I will make her officials and wise men drunk, ‡along with her governors, leaders, and warriors.‡They will fall asleep forever and never wake up,” ‡says the King whose name is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
20271	24	51	58	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says,‡“Babylon’s thick wall will be completely demolished. ‡Her high gates will be set on fire.‡The peoples strive for what does not satisfy. ‡The nations grow weary trying to get what will be destroyed.”
20272	24	51	59	¶This is the order Jeremiah the prophet gave to Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went to King Zedekiah of Judah in Babylon during the fourth year of his reign. (Seraiah was a quartermaster.)
20273	24	51	60	Jeremiah recorded on one scroll all the judgments that would come upon Babylon – all these prophecies written about Babylon.
20274	24	51	61	Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you arrive in Babylon, make sure you read aloud all these prophecies.
20275	24	51	62	Then say, ‘O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you have announced that you will destroy this place so that no people or animals live in it any longer. Certainly it will lie desolate forever!’
20276	24	51	63	When you finish reading this scroll aloud, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River.
20277	24	51	64	Then say, ‘In the same way Babylon will sink and never rise again because of the disaster I am ready to bring upon her; they will grow faint.’”¶The prophecies of Jeremiah end here.
20278	24	52	1	¶Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.
20279	24	52	2	He did what displeased the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> just as Jehoiakim had done.
20280	24	52	3	¶What follows is a record of what happened to Jerusalem and Judah because of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anger when he drove them out of his sight. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
20281	24	52	4	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against Jerusalem with his whole army and set up camp outside it. They built siege ramps all around it. He arrived on the tenth day of the tenth month in the ninth year that Zedekiah ruled over Judah.
20282	24	52	5	The city remained under siege until Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
20283	24	52	6	By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city was so severe the residents had no food.
20284	24	52	7	They broke through the city walls, and all the soldiers tried to escape. They left the city during the night. They went through the gate between the two walls that is near the king’s garden. (The Babylonians had the city surrounded.) Then they headed for the rift valley.
20285	24	52	8	But the Babylonian army chased after the king. They caught up with Zedekiah in the rift valley plains of Jericho, and his entire army deserted him.
20286	24	52	9	They captured him and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the territory of Hamath and he passed sentence on him there.
20287	24	52	10	The king of Babylon had Zedekiah’s sons put to death while Zedekiah was forced to watch. He also had all the nobles of Judah put to death there at Riblah.
20288	24	52	11	He had Zedekiah’s eyes put out and had him bound in chains. Then the king of Babylon had him led off to Babylon and he was imprisoned there until the day he died.
20289	24	52	12	¶On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard who served the king of Babylon, arrived in Jerusalem.
20290	24	52	13	He burned down the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple, the royal palace, and all the houses in Jerusalem, including every large house.
20291	24	52	14	The whole Babylonian army that came with the captain of the royal guard tore down the walls that surrounded Jerusalem.
20292	24	52	15	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, took into exile some of the poor, the rest of the people who remained in the city, those who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen.
20293	24	52	16	But he left behind some of the poor and gave them fields and vineyards.
20294	24	52	17	¶The Babylonians broke the two bronze pillars in the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, as well as the movable stands and the large bronze basin called “The Sea.” They took all the bronze to Babylon.
20295	24	52	18	They also took the pots, shovels, trimming shears, basins, pans, and all the bronze utensils used by the priests.
20296	24	52	19	The captain of the royal guard took the gold and silver bowls, censers, basins, pots, lampstands, pans, and vessels.
20297	24	52	20	The bronze of the items that King Solomon made for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple (including the two pillars, the large bronze basin called “The Sea,” the twelve bronze bulls under “The Sea,” and the movable stands) was too heavy to be weighed.
20298	24	52	21	Each of the pillars was about 27 feet high, about 18 feet in circumference, three inches thick, and hollow.
20299	24	52	22	The bronze top of one pillar was about seven and one-half feet high and had bronze latticework and pomegranate-shaped ornaments all around it. The second pillar with its pomegranate-shaped ornaments was like it.
20300	24	52	23	There were ninety-six pomegranate-shaped ornaments on the sides; in all there were one hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments over the latticework that went around it.
20301	24	52	24	¶The captain of the royal guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest who was second in rank, and the three doorkeepers.
20302	24	52	25	From the city he took an official who was in charge of the soldiers, seven of the king’s advisers who were discovered in the city, an official army secretary who drafted citizens for military service, and sixty citizens who were discovered in the middle of the city.
20303	24	52	26	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
20304	24	52	27	The king of Babylon ordered them to be executed at Riblah in the territory of Hamath.¶So Judah was taken into exile away from its land.
20305	24	52	28	Here is the official record of the number of people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: In the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;
20306	24	52	29	in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;
20307	24	52	30	in Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, carried into exile 745 Judeans. In all 4,600 people went into exile.
20308	24	52	31	¶In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, King Evil-Merodach of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison.
20309	24	52	32	He spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prestigious position than the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
20310	24	52	33	Jehoiachin took off his prison clothes and ate daily in the king’s presence for the rest of his life.
20311	24	52	34	He was given daily provisions by the king of Babylon for the rest of his life until the day he died.
20312	25	1	1	†Alas! The city once full of people ‡now sits all alone! ‡The prominent lady among the nations‡has become a widow! ‡The princess who once ruled the provinces ‡has become a forced laborer!
20313	25	1	2	†She weeps bitterly at night;‡tears stream down her cheeks. ‡She has no one to comfort her‡among all her lovers. ‡All her friends have betrayed her;‡they have become her enemies.
20314	25	1	3	†Judah has departed into exile ‡under affliction and harsh oppression. ‡She lives among the nations;‡she has found no resting place.‡All who pursued her overtook her‡in narrow straits.
20315	25	1	4	†The roads to Zion mourn ‡because no one travels to the festivals. ‡All her city gates are deserted; ‡her priests groan. ‡Her virgins grieve; ‡she is in bitter anguish!
20316	25	1	5	†Her foes subjugated her; ‡her enemies are at ease. ‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> afflicted her‡because of her many acts of rebellion. ‡Her children went away‡captive before the enemy.
20317	25	1	6	†All of Daughter Zion’s splendor ‡has departed. ‡Her leaders became like deer;‡they found no pasture,‡so they were too exhausted to escape ‡from the hunter.
20318	25	1	7	†Jerusalem remembers, ‡when she became a poor homeless person, ‡all her treasures‡that she owned in days of old. ‡When her people fell into an enemy’s grip, ‡none of her allies came to her rescue. ‡Her enemies gloated over her;‡they sneered at her downfall.
20319	25	1	8	†Jerusalem committed terrible sin; ‡therefore she became an object of scorn. ‡All who admired her have despised her ‡because they have seen her nakedness. ‡She groans aloud ‡and turns away in shame.
20320	25	1	9	†Her menstrual flow has soiled her clothing; ‡she did not consider the consequences of her sin. ‡Her demise was astonishing, ‡and there was no one to comfort her.‡She cried, “Look, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, on my affliction ‡because my enemy boasts!”
20321	25	1	10	†An enemy grabbed ‡all her valuables. ‡Indeed she watched in horror as Gentiles ‡invaded her holy temple – ‡those whom you had commanded: ‡“They must not enter your assembly place.”
20322	25	1	11	†All her people groaned‡as they searched for a morsel of bread. ‡They exchanged their valuables ‡for just enough food ‡to stay alive. ‡“Look, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! Consider ‡that I have become worthless!”
20323	25	1	12	†Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by on the road? ‡Look and see!‡Is there any pain like mine?‡The Lord has afflicted me, ‡he has inflicted it on me ‡when he burned with anger.
20324	25	1	13	†He sent down fire ‡into my bones, and it overcame them. ‡He spread out a trapper’s net for my feet; ‡he made me turn back.‡He has made me desolate;‡I am faint all day long.
20325	25	1	14	†My sins are bound around my neck like a yoke; ‡they are fastened together by his hand.‡He has placed his yoke on my neck; ‡he has sapped my strength. ‡The Lord has handed me over ‡to those whom I cannot resist.
20326	25	1	15	†He rounded up all my mighty ones; ‡The Lord did this in my midst.‡He summoned an assembly against me ‡to shatter my young men.‡The Lord has stomped like grapes ‡the virgin daughter, Judah.
20327	25	1	16	†I weep because of these things; ‡my eyes flow with tears. ‡For there is no one in sight who can comfort me ‡or encourage me. ‡My children are desolated ‡because an enemy has prevailed.
20328	25	1	17	†Zion spread out her hands,‡but there is no one to comfort her.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has issued a decree against Jacob; ‡his neighbors have become his enemies.‡Jerusalem has become‡like filthy garbage in their midst.
20329	25	1	18	†The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is right to judge me! ‡Yes, I rebelled against his commands. ‡Please listen, all you nations, ‡and look at my suffering!‡My young women and men‡have gone into exile.
20330	25	1	19	†I called for my lovers, ‡but they had deceived me.‡My priests and my elders ‡perished in the city.‡Truly they had searched for food ‡to keep themselves alive.
20331	25	1	20	†Look, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! I am distressed; ‡my stomach is in knots! ‡My heart is pounding inside me. ‡Yes, I was terribly rebellious! ‡Out in the street the sword bereaves a mother of her children; ‡Inside the house death is present.
20332	25	1	21	†They have heard that I groan,‡yet there is no one to comfort me.‡All my enemies have heard of my trouble;‡they are glad that you have brought it about. ‡Bring about the day of judgment that you promised ‡so that they may end up like me!
20333	25	1	22	†Let all their wickedness come before you;‡afflict them‡just as you have afflicted me ‡because of all my acts of rebellion. ‡For my groans are many,‡and my heart is sick with sorrow.
20334	25	2	1	†Alas! The Lord has covered‡Daughter Zion with his anger. ‡He has thrown down the splendor of Israel‡from heaven to earth;‡he did not protect his temple ‡when he displayed his anger.
20335	25	2	2	†The Lord destroyed mercilessly ‡all the homes of Jacob’s descendants. ‡In his anger he tore down‡the fortified cities of Daughter Judah.‡He knocked to the ground and humiliated‡the kingdom and its rulers.
20336	25	2	3	†In fierce anger he destroyed ‡the whole army of Israel.‡He withdrew his right hand ‡as the enemy attacked. ‡He was like a raging fire in the land of Jacob; ‡it consumed everything around it.
20337	25	2	4	†He prepared his bow like an enemy;‡his right hand was ready to shoot. ‡Like a foe he killed everyone,‡even our strong young men; ‡he has poured out his anger like fire‡on the tent of Daughter Zion.
20338	25	2	5	†The Lord, like an enemy,‡destroyed Israel.‡He destroyed all her palaces;‡he ruined her fortified cities.‡He made everyone in Daughter Judah‡mourn and lament.
20339	25	2	6	†He destroyed his temple as if it were a vineyard; ‡he destroyed his appointed meeting place.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has made those in Zion forget‡both the festivals and the Sabbaths. ‡In his fierce anger he has spurned ‡both king and priest.
20340	25	2	7	†The Lord rejected his altar‡and abhorred his temple. ‡He handed over to the enemy ‡her palace walls;‡the enemy shouted in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple‡as if it were a feast day.
20341	25	2	8	†The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was determined to tear down‡Daughter Zion’s wall.‡He prepared to knock it down; ‡he did not withdraw his hand from destroying. ‡He made the ramparts and fortified walls lament;‡together they mourned their ruin.
20342	25	2	9	†Her city gates have fallen to the ground;‡he smashed to bits the bars that lock her gates. ‡Her king and princes were taken into exile; ‡there is no more guidance available. ‡As for her prophets, ‡they no longer receive a vision from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20343	25	2	10	†The elders of Daughter Zion‡sit on the ground in silence. ‡They have thrown dirt on their heads;‡They have dressed in sackcloth. ‡Jerusalem’s young women stare down at the ground.
20344	25	2	11	†My eyes are worn out from weeping; ‡my stomach is in knots. ‡My heart is poured out on the ground‡due to the destruction of my helpless people; ‡children and infants faint‡in the town squares.
20345	25	2	12	†Children say to their mothers, ‡“Where are food and drink?” ‡They faint like a wounded warrior‡in the city squares.‡They die slowly ‡in their mothers’ arms.
20346	25	2	13	†With what can I equate you?‡To what can I compare you, O Daughter Jerusalem?‡To what can I liken you ‡so that I might comfort you, O Virgin Daughter Zion?‡Your wound is as deep as the sea. ‡Who can heal you?
20347	25	2	14	†Your prophets saw visions for you‡that were worthless whitewash. ‡They failed to expose your sin‡so as to restore your fortunes. ‡They saw oracles for you‡that were worthless lies.
20348	25	2	15	†All who passed by on the road‡clapped their hands to mock you. ‡They sneered and shook their heads‡at Daughter Jerusalem.‡“Ha! Is this the city they called ‡‘The perfection of beauty, ‡the source of joy of the whole earth!’?”
20349	25	2	16	†All your enemies‡gloated over you. ‡They sneered and gnashed their teeth;‡they said, “We have destroyed her!‡Ha! We have waited a long time for this day.‡We have lived to see it!”
20350	25	2	17	†The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has done what he planned;‡he has fulfilled his promise ‡that he threatened long ago: ‡He has overthrown you without mercy ‡and has enabled the enemy to gloat over you;‡he has exalted your adversaries’ power.
20351	25	2	18	†Cry out from your heart to the Lord, ‡O wall of Daughter Zion! ‡Make your tears flow like a river‡all day and all night long! ‡Do not rest;‡do not let your tears stop!
20352	25	2	19	†Get up! Cry out in the night ‡when the night watches start! ‡Pour out your heart like water‡before the face of the Lord! ‡Lift up your hands to him‡for your children’s lives; ‡they are fainting from hunger ‡at every street corner.
20353	25	2	20	†Look, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord!</span> Consider! ‡Whom have you ever afflicted like this?‡Should women eat their offspring, ‡their healthy infants? ‡Should priest and prophet ‡be killed in the Lord’s sanctuary?
20354	25	2	21	†The young boys and old men‡lie dead on the ground in the streets. ‡My young women and my young men‡have fallen by the sword.‡You killed them when you were angry; ‡you slaughtered them without mercy.
20355	25	2	22	†As if it were a feast day, you call ‡enemies to terrify me on every side. ‡On the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anger‡no one escaped or survived.‡My enemy has finished off‡those healthy infants whom I bore and raised.
20356	25	3	1	†I am the man who has experienced affliction‡from the rod of his wrath.
20357	25	3	2	‡He drove me into captivity and made me walk ‡in darkness and not light.
20358	25	3	3	‡He repeatedly attacks me,‡he turns his hand against me all day long.
20359	25	3	4	†He has made my mortal skin waste away;‡he has broken my bones.
20360	25	3	5	‡He has besieged and surrounded me‡with bitter hardship.
20361	25	3	6	‡He has made me reside in deepest darkness ‡like those who died long ago.
20362	25	3	7	†He has walled me in so that I cannot get out;‡he has weighted me down with heavy prison chains.
20363	25	3	8	‡Also, when I cry out desperately for help, ‡he has shut out my prayer.
20364	25	3	9	‡He has blocked every road I take with a wall of hewn stones;‡he has made every path impassable.
20365	25	3	10	†To me he is like a bear lying in ambush, ‡like a hidden lion stalking its prey.
20366	25	3	11	‡He has obstructed my paths and torn me to pieces; ‡he has made me desolate.
20367	25	3	12	‡He drew his bow and made me ‡the target for his arrow.
20368	25	3	13	†He shot his arrows ‡into my heart.
20369	25	3	14	‡I have become the laughingstock of all people, ‡their mocking song all day long.
20370	25	3	15	‡He has given me my fill of bitter herbs‡and made me drunk with bitterness.
20371	25	3	16	†He ground my teeth in gravel;‡he trampled me in the dust.
20372	25	3	17	‡I am deprived of peace; ‡I have forgotten what happiness is.
20373	25	3	18	‡So I said, “My endurance has expired;‡I have lost all hope of deliverance from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
20374	25	3	19	†Remember my impoverished and homeless condition, ‡which is a bitter poison.
20375	25	3	20	‡I continually think about this,‡and I am depressed.
20376	25	3	21	‡But this I call to mind; ‡therefore I have hope:
20377	25	3	22	†The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s loyal kindness never ceases; ‡his compassions never end.
20378	25	3	23	‡They are fresh every morning;‡your faithfulness is abundant!
20379	25	3	24	‡“My portion is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,” I have said to myself, ‡so I will put my hope in him.
20380	25	3	25	†The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is good to those who trust in him,‡to the one who seeks him.
20381	25	3	26	‡It is good to wait patiently ‡for deliverance from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20382	25	3	27	‡It is good for a man ‡to bear the yoke while he is young.
20383	25	3	28	†Let a person sit alone in silence,‡when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is disciplining him.
20384	25	3	29	‡Let him bury his face in the dust; ‡perhaps there is hope.
20385	25	3	30	‡Let him offer his cheek to the one who hits him; ‡let him have his fill of insults.
20386	25	3	31	†For the Lord will not‡reject us forever.
20387	25	3	32	‡Though he causes us grief, he then has compassion on us ‡according to the abundance of his loyal kindness.
20388	25	3	33	‡For he is not predisposed to afflict ‡or to grieve people.
20389	25	3	34	†To crush underfoot‡all the earth’s prisoners,
20390	25	3	35	‡to deprive a person of his rights ‡in the presence of the Most High,
20391	25	3	36	‡to defraud a person in a lawsuit – ‡the Lord does not approve of such things!
20392	25	3	37	†Whose command was ever fulfilled ‡unless the Lord decreed it?
20393	25	3	38	‡Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that everything comes – ‡both calamity and blessing?
20394	25	3	39	‡Why should any living person complain‡when punished for his sins?
20395	25	3	40	†Let us carefully examine our ways, ‡and let us return to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20396	25	3	41	‡Let us lift up our hearts and our hands‡to God in heaven:
20397	25	3	42	‡“We have blatantly rebelled; ‡you have not forgiven.”
20398	25	3	43	†You shrouded yourself with anger and then pursued us;‡you killed without mercy.
20399	25	3	44	‡You shrouded yourself with a cloud‡so that no prayer can get through.
20400	25	3	45	‡You make us like filthy scum ‡in the estimation of the nations.
20401	25	3	46	†All our enemies have gloated over us;
20402	25	3	47	‡Panic and pitfall have come upon us,‡devastation and destruction.
20403	25	3	48	‡Streams of tears flow from my eyes ‡because my people are destroyed.
20404	25	3	49	†Tears flow from my eyes and will not stop;‡there will be no break
20405	25	3	50	‡until the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> looks down from heaven ‡and sees what has happened.
20406	25	3	51	‡What my eyes see grieves me – ‡all the suffering of the daughters in my city.
20407	25	3	52	†For no good reason my enemies‡hunted me down like a bird.
20408	25	3	53	‡They shut me up in a pit‡and threw stones at me.
20409	25	3	54	‡The waters closed over my head;‡I thought I was about to die.
20410	25	3	55	†I have called on your name, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡from the deepest pit.
20411	25	3	56	‡You heard my plea: ‡“Do not close your ears to my cry for relief!”
20412	25	3	57	‡You came near on the day I called to you;‡you said, “Do not fear!”
20413	25	3	58	†O Lord, you championed my cause, ‡you redeemed my life.
20414	25	3	59	‡You have seen the wrong done to me, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡pronounce judgment on my behalf!
20415	25	3	60	‡You have seen all their vengeance,‡all their plots against me.
20416	25	3	61	†You have heard their taunts, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡all their plots against me.
20417	25	3	62	‡My assailants revile and conspire ‡against me all day long.
20418	25	3	63	‡Watch them from morning to evening; ‡I am the object of their mocking songs.
20419	25	3	64	†Pay them back what they deserve, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡according to what they have done.
20420	25	3	65	‡Give them a distraught heart; ‡may your curse be on them!
20421	25	3	66	‡Pursue them in anger and eradicate them‡from under the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s heaven.
20422	25	4	1	†Alas! Gold has lost its luster; ‡pure gold loses value. ‡Jewels are scattered‡on every street corner.
20423	25	4	2	†The precious sons of Zion ‡were worth their weight in gold – ‡Alas! – but now they are treated like broken clay pots,‡made by a potter.
20424	25	4	3	†Even the jackals nurse their young‡at their breast, ‡but my people are cruel,‡like ostriches in the wilderness.
20425	25	4	4	†The infant’s tongue sticks ‡to the roof of its mouth due to thirst; ‡little children beg for bread, ‡but no one gives them even a morsel.
20426	25	4	5	†Those who once feasted on delicacies ‡are now starving to death in the streets.‡Those who grew up wearing expensive clothes ‡are now dying amid garbage.
20427	25	4	6	†The punishment of my people ‡exceeded that of Sodom,‡which was overthrown in a moment‡with no one to help her.
20428	25	4	7	†Her consecrated ones were brighter than snow,‡whiter than milk;‡their bodies more ruddy than corals,‡their hair like lapis lazuli.
20429	25	4	8	†Now their appearance is darker than soot;‡they are not recognized in the streets.‡Their skin has shriveled on their bones;‡it is dried up, like tree bark.
20430	25	4	9	†Those who died by the sword are better off‡than those who die of hunger, ‡those who waste away, ‡struck down from lack of food.
20431	25	4	10	†The hands of tenderhearted women ‡cooked their own children,‡who became their food, ‡when my people were destroyed.
20432	25	4	11	†The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> fully vented his wrath;‡he poured out his fierce anger. ‡He started a fire in Zion;‡it consumed her foundations.
20433	25	4	12	†Neither the kings of the earth‡nor the people of the lands ever thought ‡that enemy or foe would enter‡the gates of Jerusalem.
20434	25	4	13	†But it happened due to the sins of her prophets ‡and the iniquities of her priests,‡who poured out in her midst‡the blood of the righteous.
20435	25	4	14	†They wander blindly through the streets,‡defiled by the blood they shed, ‡while no one dares ‡to touch their garments.
20436	25	4	15	†People cry to them, “Turn away! You are unclean! ‡Turn away! Turn away! Don’t touch us!”‡So they have fled and wander about;‡but the nations say, “They may not stay here any longer.”
20437	25	4	16	†The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> himself has scattered them;‡he no longer watches over them.‡They did not honor the priests; ‡they did not show favor to the elders.
20438	25	4	17	†Our eyes continually failed us‡as we looked in vain for help. ‡From our watchtowers we watched ‡for a nation that could not rescue us.
20439	25	4	18	†Our enemies hunted us down at every step ‡so that we could not walk about in our streets.‡Our end drew near, our days were numbered, ‡for our end had come!
20440	25	4	19	†Those who pursued us were swifter‡than eagles in the sky. ‡They chased us over the mountains;‡they ambushed us in the wilderness.
20441	25	4	20	†Our very life breath – the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s anointed king – ‡was caught in their traps, ‡of whom we thought, ‡“Under his protection we will survive among the nations.”
20442	25	4	21	†Rejoice and be glad for now, O people of Edom, ‡who reside in the land of Uz.‡But the cup of judgment will pass to you also;‡you will get drunk and take off your clothes.
20443	25	4	22	†O people of Zion, your punishment will come to an end; ‡he will not prolong your exile.‡But, O people of Edom, he will punish your sin ‡and reveal your offenses!
20444	25	5	1	‡O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, reflect on what has happened to us;‡consider and look at our disgrace.
20445	25	5	2	‡Our inheritance is turned over to strangers;‡foreigners now occupy our homes.
20446	25	5	3	‡We have become fatherless orphans;‡our mothers have become widows.
20447	25	5	4	‡We must pay money for our own water; ‡we must buy our own wood at a steep price.
20448	25	5	5	‡We are pursued – they are breathing down our necks; ‡we are weary and have no rest.
20449	25	5	6	‡We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria‡in order to buy food to eat.
20450	25	5	7	‡Our forefathers sinned and are dead, ‡but we suffer their punishment.
20451	25	5	8	‡Slaves rule over us;‡there is no one to rescue us from their power.
20452	25	5	9	‡At the risk of our lives we get our food ‡because robbers lurk in the wilderness.
20453	25	5	10	‡Our skin is hot as an oven‡due to a fever from hunger.
20454	25	5	11	‡They raped women in Zion,‡virgins in the towns of Judah.
20455	25	5	12	‡Princes were hung by their hands; ‡elders were mistreated.
20456	25	5	13	‡The young men perform menial labor; ‡boys stagger from their labor.
20457	25	5	14	‡The elders are gone from the city gate;‡the young men have stopped playing their music.
20458	25	5	15	‡Our hearts no longer have any joy; ‡our dancing is turned to mourning.
20459	25	5	16	‡The crown has fallen from our head;‡woe to us, for we have sinned!
20460	25	5	17	‡Because of this, our hearts are sick; ‡because of these things, we can hardly see through our tears.
20461	25	5	18	‡For wild animals are prowling over Mount Zion,‡which lies desolate.
20462	25	5	19	‡But you, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, reign forever;‡your throne endures from generation to generation.
20463	25	5	20	‡Why do you keep on forgetting us?‡Why do you forsake us so long?
20464	25	5	21	‡Bring us back to yourself, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, so that we may return to you;‡renew our life as in days before,
20465	25	5	22	‡unless you have utterly rejected us ‡and are angry with us beyond measure.
20466	26	1	1	¶In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiles at the Kebar River, the heavens opened and I saw a divine vision.
20467	26	1	2	(On the fifth day of the month – it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile –
20468	26	1	3	the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to the priest Ezekiel the son of Buzi, at the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. The hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came on him there).
20469	26	1	4	¶As I watched, I noticed a windstorm coming from the north – an enormous cloud, with lightning flashing, such that bright light rimmed it and came from it like glowing amber from the middle of a fire.
20470	26	1	5	In the fire were what looked like four living beings. In their appearance they had human form,
20471	26	1	6	but each had four faces and four wings.
20472	26	1	7	Their legs were straight, but the soles of their feet were like calves’ feet. They gleamed like polished bronze.
20473	26	1	8	They had human hands under their wings on their four sides. As for the faces and wings of the four of them,
20474	26	1	9	their wings touched each other; they did not turn as they moved, but went straight ahead.
20475	26	1	10	¶Their faces had this appearance: Each of the four had the face of a man, with the face of a lion on the right, the face of an ox on the left and also the face of an eagle.
20476	26	1	11	Their wings were spread out above them; each had two wings touching the wings of one of the other beings on either side and two wings covering their bodies.
20477	26	1	12	Each moved straight ahead – wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.
20478	26	1	13	In the middle of the living beings was something like burning coals of fire or like torches. It moved back and forth among the living beings. It was bright, and lightning was flashing out of the fire.
20479	26	1	14	The living beings moved backward and forward as quickly as flashes of lightning.
20480	26	1	15	¶Then I looked, and I saw one wheel on the ground beside each of the four beings.
20481	26	1	16	The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like gleaming jasper, and all four wheels looked alike. Their structure was like a wheel within a wheel.
20482	26	1	17	When they moved they would go in any of the four directions they faced without turning as they moved.
20483	26	1	18	Their rims were high and awesome, and the rims of all four wheels were full of eyes all around.
20484	26	1	19	¶When the living beings moved, the wheels beside them moved; when the living beings rose up from the ground, the wheels rose up too.
20485	26	1	20	Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise up beside them because the spirit of the living being was in the wheel.
20486	26	1	21	When the living beings moved, the wheels moved, and when they stopped moving, the wheels stopped. When they rose up from the ground, the wheels rose up from the ground; the wheels rose up beside them because the spirit of the living being was in the wheel.
20487	26	1	22	¶Over the heads of the living beings was something like a platform, glittering awesomely like ice, stretched out over their heads.
20488	26	1	23	Under the platform their wings were stretched out, each toward the other. Each of the beings also had two wings covering its body.
20489	26	1	24	When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings – it was like the sound of rushing waters, or the voice of the Sovereign One, or the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.
20490	26	1	25	¶Then there was a voice from above the platform over their heads when they stood still.
20491	26	1	26	Above the platform over their heads was something like a sapphire shaped like a throne. High above on the throne was a form that appeared to be a man.
20492	26	1	27	I saw an amber glow like a fire enclosed all around from his waist up. From his waist down I saw something that looked like fire. There was a brilliant light around it,
20493	26	1	28	like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds after the rain. This was the appearance of the surrounding brilliant light; it looked like the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. When I saw it, I threw myself face down, and I heard a voice speaking.
20494	26	2	1	¶He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet and I will speak with you.”
20495	26	2	2	As he spoke to me, a wind came into me and stood me on my feet, and I heard the one speaking to me.
20496	26	2	3	¶He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the house of Israel, to rebellious nations who have rebelled against me; both they and their fathers have revolted against me to this very day.
20497	26	2	4	The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and hard-hearted, and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says.’
20498	26	2	5	And as for them, whether they listen or not – for they are a rebellious house – they will know that a prophet has been among them.
20499	26	2	6	But you, son of man, do not fear them, and do not fear their words – even though briers and thorns surround you and you live among scorpions – do not fear their words and do not be terrified of the looks they give you, for they are a rebellious house!
20500	26	2	7	You must speak my words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious.
20501	26	2	8	As for you, son of man, listen to what I am saying to you: Do not rebel like that rebellious house! Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.”
20502	26	2	9	¶Then I looked and realized a hand was stretched out to me, and in it was a written scroll.
20503	26	2	10	He unrolled it before me, and it had writing on the front and back; written on it were laments, mourning, and woe.
20504	26	3	1	¶He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you see in front of you – eat this scroll – and then go and speak to the house of Israel.”
20505	26	3	2	So I opened my mouth and he fed me the scroll.
20506	26	3	3	¶He said to me, “Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your belly with this scroll I am giving to you.” So I ate it, and it was sweet like honey in my mouth.
20507	26	3	4	¶He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.
20508	26	3	5	For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel –
20509	26	3	6	not to many peoples of unintelligible speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand – surely if I had sent you to them, they would listen to you!
20510	26	3	7	But the house of Israel is unwilling to listen to you, because they are not willing to listen to me, for the whole house of Israel is hard-headed and hard-hearted.
20511	26	3	8	¶“I have made your face adamant to match their faces, and your forehead hard to match their foreheads.
20512	26	3	9	I have made your forehead harder than flint – like diamond! Do not fear them or be terrified of the looks they give you, for they are a rebellious house.”
20513	26	3	10	¶And he said to me, “Son of man, take all my words that I speak to you to heart and listen carefully.
20514	26	3	11	Go to the exiles, to your fellow countrymen, and speak to them – say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,’ whether they pay attention or not.”
20515	26	3	12	¶Then a wind lifted me up and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me as the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rose from its place,
20516	26	3	13	and the sound of the living beings’ wings brushing against each other, and the sound of the wheels alongside them, a great rumbling sound.
20517	26	3	14	A wind lifted me up and carried me away. I went bitterly, my spirit full of fury, and the hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rested powerfully on me.
20518	26	3	15	I came to the exiles at Tel Abib, who lived by the Kebar River. I sat dumbfounded among them there, where they were living, for seven days.
20519	26	3	16	¶At the end of seven days the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20520	26	3	17	“Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you must give them a warning from me.
20521	26	3	18	When I say to the wicked, “You will certainly die,” and you do not warn him – you do not speak out to warn the wicked to turn from his wicked lifestyle so that he may live – that wicked person will die for his iniquity, but I will hold you accountable for his death.
20522	26	3	19	But as for you, if you warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wicked deed and from his wicked lifestyle, he will die for his iniquity but you will have saved your own life.
20523	26	3	20	¶“When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I set an obstacle before him, he will die. If you have not warned him, he will die for his sin. The righteous deeds he performed will not be considered, but I will hold you accountable for his death.
20524	26	3	21	However, if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he will certainly live because he was warned, and you will have saved your own life.”
20525	26	3	22	¶The hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rested on me there, and he said to me, “Get up, go out to the valley, and I will speak with you there.”
20526	26	3	23	So I got up and went out to the valley, and the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was standing there, just like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I threw myself face down.
20527	26	3	24	¶Then a wind came into me and stood me on my feet. The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to me and said, “Go shut yourself in your house.
20528	26	3	25	As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and tie you up with them, so you cannot go out among them.
20529	26	3	26	I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to reprove them, for they are a rebellious house.
20530	26	3	27	But when I speak with you, I will loosen your tongue and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says.’ Those who listen will listen, but the indifferent will refuse, for they are a rebellious house.
20531	26	4	1	¶“And you, son of man, take a brick and set it in front of you. Inscribe a city on it – Jerusalem.
20532	26	4	2	Lay siege to it! Build siege works against it. Erect a siege ramp against it! Post soldiers outside it and station battering rams around it.
20533	26	4	3	Then for your part take an iron frying pan and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face toward it. It is to be under siege; you are to besiege it. This is a sign for the house of Israel.
20534	26	4	4	¶“Also for your part lie on your left side and place the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. For the number of days you lie on your side you will bear their iniquity.
20535	26	4	5	I have determined that the number of the years of their iniquity are to be the number of days for you – 390 days. So bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
20536	26	4	6	¶“When you have completed these days, then lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah 40 days – I have assigned one day for each year.
20537	26	4	7	You must turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared and prophesy against it.
20538	26	4	8	Look here, I will tie you up with ropes, so you cannot turn from one side to the other until you complete the days of your siege.
20539	26	4	9	¶“As for you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, put them in a single container, and make food from them for yourself. For the same number of days that you lie on your side – 390 days – you will eat it.
20540	26	4	10	The food you eat will be eight ounces a day by weight; you must eat it at fixed times.
20541	26	4	11	And you must drink water by measure, a pint and a half; you must drink it at fixed times.
20542	26	4	12	And you must eat the food like you would a barley cake. You must bake it in front of them over a fire made with dried human excrement.”
20543	26	4	13	And the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “This is how the people of Israel will eat their unclean food among the nations where I will banish them.”
20544	26	4	14	¶And I said, “Ah, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I have never been ceremonially defiled before. I have never eaten a carcass or an animal torn by wild beasts; from my youth up, unclean meat has never entered my mouth.”
20545	26	4	15	¶So he said to me, “All right then, I will substitute cow’s manure instead of human excrement. You will cook your food over it.”
20546	26	4	16	¶Then he said to me, “Son of man, I am about to remove the bread supply in Jerusalem. They will eat their bread ration anxiously, and they will drink their water ration in terror
20547	26	4	17	because they will lack bread and water. Each one will be terrified, and they will rot for their iniquity.
20548	26	5	1	¶“As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber’s razor. Shave off some of the hair from your head and your beard. Then take scales and divide up the hair you cut off.
20549	26	5	2	Burn a third of it in the fire inside the city when the days of your siege are completed. Take a third and slash it with a sword all around the city. Scatter a third to the wind, and I will unleash a sword behind them.
20550	26	5	3	But take a few strands of hair from those and tie them in the ends of your garment.
20551	26	5	4	Again, take more of them and throw them into the fire, and burn them up. From there a fire will spread to all the house of Israel.
20552	26	5	5	¶“This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: This is Jerusalem; I placed her in the center of the nations with countries all around her.
20553	26	5	6	Then she defied my regulations and my statutes, becoming more wicked than the nations and the countries around her. Indeed, they have rejected my regulations, and they do not follow my statutes.
20554	26	5	7	¶“Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Because you are more arrogant than the nations around you, you have not followed my statutes and have not carried out my regulations. You have not even carried out the regulations of the nations around you!
20555	26	5	8	¶“Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: I – even I – am against you, and I will execute judgment among you while the nations watch.
20556	26	5	9	I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again because of all your abominable practices.
20557	26	5	10	Therefore fathers will eat their sons within you, Jerusalem, and sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments on you, and I will scatter any survivors to the winds.
20558	26	5	11	¶“Therefore, as surely as I live, says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, because you defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominable practices, I will withdraw; my eye will not pity you, nor will I spare you.
20559	26	5	12	A third of your people will die of plague or be overcome by the famine within you. A third of your people will fall by the sword surrounding you, and a third I will scatter to the winds. I will unleash a sword behind them.
20560	26	5	13	Then my anger will be fully vented; I will exhaust my rage on them, and I will be appeased. Then they will know that I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have spoken in my jealousy when I have fully vented my rage against them.
20561	26	5	14	¶“I will make you desolate and an object of scorn among the nations around you, in the sight of everyone who passes by.
20562	26	5	15	You will be an object of scorn and taunting, a prime example of destruction among the nations around you when I execute judgments against you in anger and raging fury. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> have spoken!
20563	26	5	16	I will shoot against them deadly, destructive arrows of famine, which I will shoot to destroy you. I will prolong a famine on you and will remove the bread supply.
20564	26	5	17	I will send famine and wild beasts against you and they will take your children from you. Plague and bloodshed will overwhelm you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> have spoken!”
20565	26	6	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20566	26	6	2	“Son of man, turn toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them:
20567	26	6	3	Say, ‘Mountains of Israel, Hear the word of the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: I am bringing a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.
20568	26	6	4	Your altars will be ruined and your incense altars will be broken. I will throw down your slain in front of your idols.
20569	26	6	5	I will place the corpses of the people of Israel in front of their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
20570	26	6	6	In all your dwellings, the cities will be laid waste and the high places ruined so that your altars will be laid waste and ruined, your idols will be shattered and demolished, your incense altars will be broken down, and your works wiped out.
20571	26	6	7	The slain will fall among you and then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20572	26	6	8	¶“‘But I will spare some of you. Some will escape the sword when you are scattered in foreign lands.
20573	26	6	9	Then your survivors will remember me among the nations where they are exiled. They will realize how I was crushed by their unfaithful heart which turned from me and by their eyes which lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves because of the evil they have done and because of all their abominable practices.
20574	26	6	10	They will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord;</span> my threats to bring this catastrophe on them were not empty.’
20575	26	6	11	¶“‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Clap your hands, stamp your feet, and say, “Ah!” because of all the evil, abominable practices of the house of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, famine, and pestilence.
20576	26	6	12	The one far away will die by pestilence, the one close by will fall by the sword, and whoever is left and has escaped these will die by famine. I will fully vent my rage against them.
20577	26	6	13	Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – when their dead lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill and all the mountaintops, under every green tree and every leafy oak, the places where they have offered fragrant incense to all their idols.
20578	26	6	14	I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate waste from the wilderness to Riblah, in all the places where they live. Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
20579	26	7	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20580	26	7	2	“You, son of man – this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to the land of Israel: An end! The end is coming on the four corners of the land!
20581	26	7	3	The end is now upon you, and I will release my anger against you; I will judge you according to your behavior, I will hold you accountable for all your abominable practices.
20582	26	7	4	My eye will not pity you; I will not spare you. For I will hold you responsible for your behavior, and you will suffer the consequences of your abominable practices. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!
20583	26	7	5	¶“This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: A disaster – a one-of-a-kind disaster – is coming!
20584	26	7	6	An end comes – the end comes! It has awakened against you! Look, it is coming!
20585	26	7	7	Doom is coming upon you who live in the land! The time is coming, the day is near. There are sounds of tumult, not shouts of joy, on the mountains.
20586	26	7	8	Soon now I will pour out my rage on you; I will fully vent my anger against you. I will judge you according to your behavior. I will hold you accountable for all your abominable practices.
20587	26	7	9	My eye will not pity you; I will not spare you. For your behavior I will hold you accountable, and you will suffer the consequences of your abominable practices. Then you will know that it is I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who is striking you.
20588	26	7	10	¶“Look, the day! Look, it is coming! Doom has gone out! The staff has budded, pride has blossomed!
20589	26	7	11	Violence has grown into a staff that supports wickedness. Not one of them will be left – not from their crowd, not from their wealth, not from their prominence.
20590	26	7	12	The time has come; the day has struck! The customer should not rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for divine wrath comes against their whole crowd.
20591	26	7	13	The customer will no longer pay the seller while both parties are alive, for the vision against their whole crowd will not be revoked. Each person, for his iniquity, will fail to preserve his life.
20592	26	7	14	¶“They have blown the trumpet and everyone is ready, but no one goes to battle, because my anger is against their whole crowd.
20593	26	7	15	The sword is outside; pestilence and famine are inside the house. Whoever is in the open field will die by the sword, and famine and pestilence will consume everyone in the city.
20594	26	7	16	Their survivors will escape to the mountains and become like doves of the valleys; all of them will moan – each one for his iniquity.
20595	26	7	17	All of their hands will hang limp; their knees will be wet with urine.
20596	26	7	18	They will wear sackcloth, terror will cover them; shame will be on all their faces, and all of their heads will be shaved bald.
20597	26	7	19	They will discard their silver in the streets, and their gold will be treated like filth. Their silver and gold will not be able to deliver them on the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s fury. They will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs because their wealth was the obstacle leading to their iniquity.
20598	26	7	20	They rendered the beauty of his ornaments into pride, and with it they made their abominable images – their detestable idols. Therefore I will render it filthy to them.
20599	26	7	21	I will give it to foreigners as loot, to the world’s wicked ones as plunder, and they will desecrate it.
20600	26	7	22	I will turn my face away from them and they will desecrate my treasured place. Vandals will enter it and desecrate it.
20601	26	7	23	(Make the chain, because the land is full of murder and the city is full of violence.)
20602	26	7	24	I will bring the most wicked of the nations and they will take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the arrogance of the strong, and their sanctuaries will be desecrated.
20603	26	7	25	Terror is coming! They will seek peace, but find none.
20604	26	7	26	Disaster after disaster will come, and one rumor after another. They will seek a vision from a prophet; priestly instruction will disappear, along with counsel from the elders.
20605	26	7	27	The king will mourn and the prince will be clothed with shuddering; the hands of the people of the land will tremble. Based on their behavior I will deal with them, and by their standard of justice I will judge them. Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!”
20606	26	8	1	¶In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth of the month, as I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah sitting in front of me, the hand of the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> seized me.
20607	26	8	2	As I watched, I noticed a form that appeared to be a man. From his waist downward was something like fire, and from his waist upward something like a brightness, like an amber glow.
20608	26	8	3	He stretched out the form of a hand and grabbed me by a lock of hair on my head. Then a wind lifted me up between the earth and sky and brought me to Jerusalem by means of divine visions, to the door of the inner gate which faces north where the statue which provokes to jealousy was located.
20609	26	8	4	Then I perceived that the glory of the God of Israel was there, as in the vision I had seen earlier in the valley.
20610	26	8	5	¶He said to me, “Son of man, look up toward the north.” So I looked up toward the north, and I noticed to the north of the altar gate was this statue of jealousy at the entrance.
20611	26	8	6	¶He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing – the great abominations that the people of Israel are practicing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see greater abominations than these!”
20612	26	8	7	¶He brought me to the entrance of the court, and as I watched, I noticed a hole in the wall.
20613	26	8	8	He said to me, “Son of man, dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and discovered a doorway.
20614	26	8	9	¶He said to me, “Go in and see the evil abominations they are practicing here.”
20615	26	8	10	So I went in and looked. I noticed every figure of creeping thing and beast – detestable images – and every idol of the house of Israel, engraved on the wall all around.
20616	26	8	11	Seventy men from the elders of the house of Israel (with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing among them) were standing in front of them, each with a censer in his hand, and fragrant vapors from a cloud of incense were swirling upward.
20617	26	8	12	¶He said to me, “Do you see, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in the chamber of his idolatrous images? For they think, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> does not see us! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has abandoned the land!’”
20618	26	8	13	He said to me, “You will see them practicing even greater abominations!”
20619	26	8	14	¶Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s house. I noticed women sitting there weeping for Tammuz.
20620	26	8	15	He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see even greater abominations than these!”
20621	26	8	16	¶Then he brought me to the inner court of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s house. Right there at the entrance to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s temple, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s temple, facing east – they were worshiping the sun toward the east!
20622	26	8	17	¶He said to me, “Do you see, son of man? Is it a trivial thing that the house of Judah commits these abominations they are practicing here? For they have filled the land with violence and provoked me to anger still further. Look, they are putting the branch to their nose!
20623	26	8	18	Therefore I will act with fury! My eye will not pity them nor will I spare them. When they have shouted in my ears, I will not listen to them.”
20624	26	9	1	¶Then he shouted in my ears, “Approach, you who are to visit destruction on the city, each with his destructive weapon in his hand!”
20625	26	9	2	Next, I noticed six men coming from the direction of the upper gate which faces north, each with his war club in his hand. Among them was a man dressed in linen with a writing kit at his side. They came and stood beside the bronze altar.
20626	26	9	3	¶Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub where it had rested to the threshold of the temple. He called to the man dressed in linen who had the writing kit at his side.
20627	26	9	4	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Go through the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of the people who moan and groan over all the abominations practiced in it.”
20628	26	9	5	¶While I listened, he said to the others, “Go through the city after him and strike people down; do not let your eye pity nor spare anyone!
20629	26	9	6	Old men, young men, young women, little children, and women – wipe them out! But do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary!” So they began with the elders who were at the front of the temple.
20630	26	9	7	¶He said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courtyards with corpses. Go!” So they went out and struck people down throughout the city.
20631	26	9	8	While they were striking them down, I was left alone, and I threw myself face down and cried out, “Ah, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! Will you destroy the entire remnant of Israel when you pour out your fury on Jerusalem?”
20632	26	9	9	¶He said to me, “The sin of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is full of murder, and the city is full of corruption, for they say, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has abandoned the land, and the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> does not see!’
20633	26	9	10	But as for me, my eye will not pity them nor will I spare them; I hereby repay them for what they have done.”
20634	26	9	11	¶Next I noticed the man dressed in linen with the writing kit at his side bringing back word: “I have done just as you commanded me.”
20635	26	10	1	¶As I watched, I saw on the platform above the top of the cherubim something like a sapphire, resembling the shape of a throne, appearing above them.
20636	26	10	2	The<span class=\"smcaps\"> Lord</span> said to the man dressed in linen, “Go between the wheelwork underneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” He went as I watched.
20637	26	10	3	¶(The cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.)
20638	26	10	4	Then the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> arose from the cherub and moved to the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud while the court was filled with the brightness of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s glory.
20639	26	10	5	The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard from the outer court, like the sound of the Sovereign God when he speaks.
20640	26	10	6	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded the man dressed in linen, “Take fire from within the wheelwork, from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood by one of the wheels.
20641	26	10	7	Then one of the cherubim stretched out his hand toward the fire which was among the cherubim. He took some and put it into the hands of the man dressed in linen, who took it and left.
20642	26	10	8	(The cherubim appeared to have the form of human hands under their wings.)
20643	26	10	9	¶As I watched, I noticed four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub; the wheels gleamed like jasper.
20644	26	10	10	As for their appearance, all four of them looked the same, something like a wheel within a wheel.
20645	26	10	11	When they moved, they would go in any of the four directions they faced without turning as they moved; in the direction the head would turn they would follow without turning as they moved,
20646	26	10	12	along with their entire bodies, their backs, their hands, and their wings. The wheels of the four of them were full of eyes all around.
20647	26	10	13	As for their wheels, they were called “the wheelwork” as I listened.
20648	26	10	14	Each of the cherubim had four faces: The first was the face of a cherub, the second that of a man, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that of an eagle.
20649	26	10	15	¶The cherubim rose up; these were the living beings I saw at the Kebar River.
20650	26	10	16	When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them; when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not move from their side.
20651	26	10	17	When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still, and when they rose up, the wheels rose up with them, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.
20652	26	10	18	¶Then the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> moved away from the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim.
20653	26	10	19	The cherubim spread their wings, and they rose up from the earth while I watched (when they went the wheels went alongside them). They stopped at the entrance to the east gate of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple as the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them.
20654	26	10	20	¶These were the living creatures which I saw at the Kebar River underneath the God of Israel; I knew that they were cherubim.
20655	26	10	21	Each had four faces; each had four wings and the form of human hands under the wings.
20656	26	10	22	As for the form of their faces, they were the faces whose appearance I had seen at the Kebar River. Each one moved straight ahead.
20657	26	11	1	¶A wind lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple that faces the east. There, at the entrance of the gate, I noticed twenty-five men. Among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, officials of the people.
20658	26	11	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who plot evil and give wicked advice in this city.
20659	26	11	3	They say, ‘The time is not near to build houses; the city is a cooking pot and we are the meat in it.’
20660	26	11	4	Therefore, prophesy against them! Prophesy, son of man!”
20661	26	11	5	¶Then the Spirit of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came upon me and said to me, “Say: This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‘This is what you are thinking, O house of Israel; I know what goes through your minds.
20662	26	11	6	You have killed many people in this city; you have filled its streets with corpses.’
20663	26	11	7	Therefore, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‘The corpses you have dumped in the midst of the city are the meat, and this city is the cooking pot, but I will take you out of it.
20664	26	11	8	You fear the sword, so the sword I will bring against you,’ declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20665	26	11	9	‘But I will take you out of the city. And I will hand you over to foreigners. I will execute judgments on you.
20666	26	11	10	You will die by the sword; I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20667	26	11	11	This city will not be a cooking pot for you, and you will not be meat within it; I will judge you at the border of Israel.
20668	26	11	12	Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, whose statutes you have not followed and whose regulations you have not carried out. Instead you have behaved according to the regulations of the nations around you!’”
20669	26	11	13	¶Now, while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I threw myself face down and cried out with a loud voice, “Alas, Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! You are completely wiping out the remnant of Israel!”
20670	26	11	14	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20671	26	11	15	“Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, and the whole house of Israel, all of them are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘They have gone far away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; to us this land has been given as a possession.’
20672	26	11	16	¶“Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Although I have removed them far away among the nations and have dispersed them among the countries, I have been a little sanctuary for them among the lands where they have gone.’
20673	26	11	17	¶“Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: When I regather you from the peoples and assemble you from the lands where you have been dispersed, I will give you back the country of Israel.’
20674	26	11	18	¶“When they return to it, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.
20675	26	11	19	I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within them; I will remove the hearts of stone from their bodies and I will give them tender hearts,
20676	26	11	20	so that they may follow my statutes and observe my regulations and carry them out. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.
20677	26	11	21	But those whose hearts are devoted to detestable things and abominations, I hereby repay them for what they have done, says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
20678	26	11	22	¶Then the cherubim spread their wings with their wheels alongside them while the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them.
20679	26	11	23	The glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rose up from within the city and stopped over the mountain east of it.
20680	26	11	24	Then a wind lifted me up and carried me to the exiles in Babylonia, in the vision given to me by the Spirit of God. ¶Then the vision I had seen went up from me.
20681	26	11	25	So I told the exiles everything the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had shown me.
20682	26	12	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20683	26	12	2	“Son of man, you are living in the midst of a rebellious house. They have eyes to see, but do not see, and ears to hear, but do not hear, because they are a rebellious house.
20684	26	12	3	¶“Therefore, son of man, pack up your belongings as if for exile. During the day, while they are watching, pretend to go into exile. Go from where you live to another place. Perhaps they will understand, although they are a rebellious house.
20685	26	12	4	Bring out your belongings packed for exile during the day while they are watching. And go out at evening, while they are watching, as if for exile.
20686	26	12	5	While they are watching, dig a hole in the wall and carry your belongings out through it.
20687	26	12	6	While they are watching, raise your baggage onto your shoulder and carry it out in the dark. You must cover your face so that you cannot see the ground because I have made you an object lesson to the house of Israel.”
20688	26	12	7	¶So I did just as I was commanded. I carried out my belongings packed for exile during the day, and at evening I dug myself a hole through the wall with my hands. I went out in the darkness, carrying my baggage on my shoulder while they watched.
20689	26	12	8	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me in the morning:
20690	26	12	9	“Son of man, has not the house of Israel, that rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’
20691	26	12	10	Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said: The prince will raise this burden in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel within it.’
20692	26	12	11	Say, ‘I am an object lesson for you. Just as I have done, it will be done to them; they will go into exile and captivity.’
20693	26	12	12	¶“The prince who is among them will raise his belongings onto his shoulder in darkness, and will go out. He will dig a hole in the wall to leave through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land with his eyes.
20694	26	12	13	But I will throw my net over him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans (but he will not see it), and there he will die.
20695	26	12	14	All his retinue – his attendants and his troops – I will scatter to every wind; I will unleash a sword behind them.
20696	26	12	15	¶“Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among foreign countries.
20697	26	12	16	But I will let a small number of them survive the sword, famine, and pestilence, so that they can confess all their abominable practices to the nations where they go. Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
20698	26	12	17	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20699	26	12	18	“Son of man, eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with anxious shaking.
20700	26	12	19	Then say to the people of the land, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says about the inhabitants of Jerusalem and of the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water in fright, for their land will be stripped bare of all it contains because of the violence of all who live in it.
20701	26	12	20	The inhabited towns will be left in ruins and the land will be devastated. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
20702	26	12	21	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20703	26	12	22	“Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel, ‘The days pass slowly, and every vision fails’?
20704	26	12	23	Therefore tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: I hereby end this proverb; they will not recite it in Israel any longer.’ But say to them, ‘The days are at hand when every vision will be fulfilled.
20705	26	12	24	For there will no longer be any false visions or flattering omens amidst the house of Israel.
20706	26	12	25	For I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, will speak. Whatever word I speak will be accomplished. It will not be delayed any longer. Indeed in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and accomplish it, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>’”
20707	26	12	26	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20708	26	12	27	“Take note, son of man, the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees is for distant days; he is prophesying about the far future.’
20709	26	12	28	Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: None of my words will be delayed any longer! The word I speak will come to pass, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>’”
20710	26	13	1	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20711	26	13	2	“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to the prophets who prophesy from their imagination: ‘Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message!
20712	26	13	3	This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit but have seen nothing!
20713	26	13	4	Your prophets have become like jackals among the ruins, O Israel.
20714	26	13	5	You have not gone up in the breaks in the wall, nor repaired a wall for the house of Israel that it would stand strong in the battle on the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20715	26	13	6	They see delusion and their omens are a lie. They say, “the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> declares,” though the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not sent them; yet they expect their word to be confirmed.
20716	26	13	7	Have you not seen a false vision and announced a lying omen when you say, “the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> declares,” although I myself never spoke?
20717	26	13	8	¶“‘Therefore, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Because you have spoken false words and forecast delusion, look, I am against you, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20718	26	13	9	My hand will be against the prophets who see delusion and announce lying omens. They will not be included in the council of my people, nor be written in the registry of the house of Israel, nor enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20719	26	13	10	¶“‘This is because they have led my people astray saying, “All is well,” when things are not well. When anyone builds a wall without mortar, they coat it with whitewash.
20720	26	13	11	Tell the ones who coat it with whitewash that it will fall. When there is a deluge of rain, hailstones will fall and a violent wind will break out.
20721	26	13	12	When the wall has collapsed, people will ask you, “Where is the whitewash you coated it with?”
20722	26	13	13	¶“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: In my rage I will make a violent wind break out. In my anger there will be a deluge of rain and hailstones in destructive fury.
20723	26	13	14	I will break down the wall you coated with whitewash and knock it to the ground so that its foundation is exposed. When it falls you will be destroyed beneath it, and you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20724	26	13	15	I will vent my rage against the wall, and against those who coated it with whitewash. Then I will say to you, “The wall is no more and those who whitewashed it are no more –
20725	26	13	16	those prophets of Israel who would prophesy about Jerusalem and would see visions of peace for it, when there was no peace,” declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’
20726	26	13	17	¶“As for you, son of man, turn toward the daughters of your people who are prophesying from their imagination. Prophesy against them
20727	26	13	18	and say ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Woe to those who sew bands on all their wrists and make headbands for heads of every size to entrap people’s lives! Will you entrap my people’s lives, yet preserve your own lives?
20728	26	13	19	You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. You have put to death people who should not die and kept alive those who should not live by your lies to my people, who listen to lies!
20729	26	13	20	¶“‘Therefore, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Take note that I am against your wristbands with which you entrap people’s lives like birds. I will tear them from your arms and will release the people’s lives, which you hunt like birds.
20730	26	13	21	I will tear off your headbands and rescue my people from your power; they will no longer be prey in your hands. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20731	26	13	22	This is because you have disheartened the righteous person with lies (although I have not grieved him), and because you have encouraged the wicked person not to turn from his evil conduct and preserve his life.
20732	26	13	23	Therefore you will no longer see false visions and practice divination. I will rescue my people from your power, and you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
20733	26	14	1	¶Then some men from Israel’s elders came to me and sat down in front of me.
20734	26	14	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20735	26	14	3	“Son of man, these men have erected their idols in their hearts and placed the obstacle leading to their iniquity right before their faces. Should I really allow them to seek me?
20736	26	14	4	Therefore speak to them and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: When anyone from the house of Israel erects his idols in his heart and sets the obstacle leading to his iniquity before his face, and then consults a prophet, I the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> am determined to answer him personally according to the enormity of his idolatry.
20737	26	14	5	I will do this in order to capture the hearts of the house of Israel, who have alienated themselves from me on account of all their idols.’
20738	26	14	6	¶“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Return! Turn from your idols, and turn your faces away from your abominations.
20739	26	14	7	For when anyone from the house of Israel, or the resident foreigner who lives in Israel, separates himself from me and erects his idols in his heart and sets the obstacle leading to his iniquity before his face, and then consults a prophet to seek something from me, I the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> am determined to answer him personally.
20740	26	14	8	I will set my face against that person and will make him an object lesson and a byword and will cut him off from among my people. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20741	26	14	9	¶“‘As for the prophet, if he is made a fool by being deceived into speaking a prophetic word – I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have made a fool of that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from among my people Israel.
20742	26	14	10	They will bear their punishment; the punishment of the one who sought an oracle will be the same as the punishment of the prophet who gave it
20743	26	14	11	so that the house of Israel will no longer go astray from me, nor continue to defile themselves by all their sins. They will be my people and I will be their God, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
20744	26	14	12	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20745	26	14	13	“Son of man, suppose a country sins against me by being unfaithful, and I stretch out my hand against it, cut off its bread supply, cause famine to come on it, and kill both people and animals.
20746	26	14	14	Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would save only their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20747	26	14	15	¶“Suppose I were to send wild animals through the land and kill its children, leaving it desolate, without travelers due to the wild animals.
20748	26	14	16	Even if these three men were in it, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, they could not save their own sons or daughters; they would save only their own lives, and the land would become desolate.
20749	26	14	17	¶“Or suppose I were to bring a sword against that land and say, ‘Let a sword pass through the land,’ and I were to kill both people and animals.
20750	26	14	18	Even if these three men were in it, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, they could not save their own sons or daughters – they would save only their own lives.
20751	26	14	19	¶“Or suppose I were to send a plague into that land, and pour out my rage on it with bloodshed, killing both people and animals.
20752	26	14	20	Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, they could not save their own son or daughter; they would save only their own lives by their righteousness.
20753	26	14	21	¶“For this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: How much worse will it be when I send my four terrible judgments – sword, famine, wild animals, and plague – to Jerusalem to kill both people and animals!
20754	26	14	22	Yet some survivors will be left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out. They will come out to you, and when you see their behavior and their deeds, you will be consoled about the catastrophe I have brought on Jerusalem – for everything I brought on it.
20755	26	14	23	They will console you when you see their behavior and their deeds, because you will know that it was not without reason that I have done everything which I have done in it, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
20756	26	15	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20757	26	15	2	“Son of man, of all the woody branches among the trees of the forest, what happens to the wood of the vine?
20758	26	15	3	Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on?
20759	26	15	4	No! It is thrown in the fire for fuel; when the fire has burned up both ends of it and it is charred in the middle, will it be useful for anything?
20760	26	15	5	Indeed! If it was not made into anything useful when it was whole, how much less can it be made into anything when the fire has burned it up and it is charred?
20761	26	15	6	¶“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Like the wood of the vine is among the trees of the forest which I have provided as fuel for the fire – so I will provide the residents of Jerusalem as fuel.
20762	26	15	7	I will set my face against them – although they have escaped from the fire, the fire will still consume them! Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> when I set my face against them.
20763	26	15	8	I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
20764	26	16	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20765	26	16	2	“Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her abominable practices
20766	26	16	3	and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
20767	26	16	4	As for your birth, on the day you were born your umbilical cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water; you were certainly not rubbed down with salt, nor wrapped with blankets.
20768	26	16	5	No eye took pity on you to do even one of these things for you to spare you; you were thrown out into the open field because you were detested on the day you were born.
20769	26	16	6	¶“‘I passed by you and saw you kicking around helplessly in your blood. I said to you as you lay there in your blood, “Live!” I said to you as you lay there in your blood, “Live!”
20770	26	16	7	I made you plentiful like sprouts in a field; you grew tall and came of age so that you could wear jewelry. Your breasts had formed and your hair had grown, but you were still naked and bare.
20771	26	16	8	¶“‘Then I passed by you and watched you, noticing that you had reached the age for love. I spread my cloak over you and covered your nakedness. I swore a solemn oath to you and entered into a marriage covenant with you, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and you became mine.
20772	26	16	9	¶“‘Then I bathed you in water, washed the blood off you, and anointed you with fragrant oil.
20773	26	16	10	I dressed you in embroidered clothing and put fine leather sandals on your feet. I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk.
20774	26	16	11	I adorned you with jewelry. I put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck.
20775	26	16	12	I put a ring in your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.
20776	26	16	13	You were adorned with gold and silver, while your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidery. You ate the finest flour, honey, and olive oil. You became extremely beautiful and attained the position of royalty.
20777	26	16	14	Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty; your beauty was perfect because of the splendor which I bestowed on you, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20778	26	16	15	¶“‘But you trusted in your beauty and capitalized on your fame by becoming a prostitute. You offered your sexual favors to every man who passed by so that your beauty became his.
20779	26	16	16	You took some of your clothing and made for yourself decorated high places; you engaged in prostitution on them. You went to him to become his.
20780	26	16	17	You also took your beautiful jewelry, made of my gold and my silver I had given to you, and made for yourself male images and engaged in prostitution with them.
20781	26	16	18	You took your embroidered clothing and used it to cover them; you offered my olive oil and my incense to them.
20782	26	16	19	As for my food that I gave you – the fine flour, olive oil, and honey I fed you – you placed it before them as a soothing aroma. That is exactly what happened, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20783	26	16	20	¶“‘You took your sons and your daughters whom you bore to me and you sacrificed them as food for the idols to eat. As if your prostitution was not enough,
20784	26	16	21	you slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols.
20785	26	16	22	And with all your abominable practices and prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth when you were naked and bare, kicking around in your blood.
20786	26	16	23	¶“‘After all of your evil – “Woe! Woe to you!” declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> –
20787	26	16	24	you built yourself a chamber and put up a pavilion in every public square.
20788	26	16	25	At the head of every street you erected your pavilion and you disgraced your beauty when you spread your legs to every passerby and multiplied your promiscuity.
20789	26	16	26	You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your promiscuity and provoking me to anger.
20790	26	16	27	So see here, I have stretched out my hand against you and cut off your rations. I have delivered you into the power of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your obscene conduct.
20791	26	16	28	You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians because your desires were insatiable; you prostituted yourself with them and yet you were still not satisfied.
20792	26	16	29	Then you multiplied your promiscuity to the land of merchants, Babylonia, but you were not satisfied there either.
20793	26	16	30	¶“‘How sick is your heart, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, when you perform all of these acts, the deeds of a bold prostitute.
20794	26	16	31	When you built your chamber at the head of every street and put up your pavilion in every public square, you were not like a prostitute, because you scoffed at payment.
20795	26	16	32	¶“‘Adulterous wife, who prefers strangers instead of her own husband!
20796	26	16	33	All prostitutes receive payment, but instead you give gifts to every one of your lovers. You bribe them to come to you from all around for your sexual favors!
20797	26	16	34	You were different from other prostitutes because no one solicited you. When you gave payment and no payment was given to you, you became the opposite!
20798	26	16	35	¶“‘Therefore O prostitute, Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message:
20799	26	16	36	This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness was uncovered in your prostitution with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols, and because of the blood of your children you have given to them,
20800	26	16	37	therefore, take note: I am about to gather all your lovers whom you enjoyed, both all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around, and I will expose your nakedness to them, and they will see all your nakedness.
20801	26	16	38	I will punish you as an adulteress and murderer deserves. I will avenge your bloody deeds with furious rage.
20802	26	16	39	I will give you into their hands and they will destroy your chambers and tear down your pavilions. They will strip you of your clothing and take your beautiful jewelry and leave you naked and bare.
20803	26	16	40	They will summon a mob who will stone you and hack you in pieces with their swords.
20804	26	16	41	They will burn down your houses and execute judgments on you in front of many women. Thus I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer give gifts to your clients.
20805	26	16	42	I will exhaust my rage on you, and then my fury will turn from you. I will calm down and no longer be angry.
20806	26	16	43	¶“‘Because you did not remember the days of your youth and have enraged me with all these deeds, I hereby repay you for what you have done, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Have you not engaged in prostitution on top of all your other abominable practices?
20807	26	16	44	¶“‘Observe – everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: “Like mother, like daughter.”
20808	26	16	45	You are the daughter of your mother, who detested her husband and her sons, and you are the sister of your sisters who detested their husbands and their sons. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
20809	26	16	46	Your older sister was Samaria, who lived north of you with her daughters, and your younger sister, who lived south of you, was Sodom with her daughters.
20810	26	16	47	Have you not copied their behavior and practiced their abominable deeds? In a short time you became even more depraved in all your conduct than they were!
20811	26	16	48	As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, your sister Sodom and her daughters never behaved as wickedly as you and your daughters have behaved.
20812	26	16	49	¶“‘See here – this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters had majesty, abundance of food, and enjoyed carefree ease, but they did not help the poor and needy.
20813	26	16	50	They were haughty and practiced abominable deeds before me. Therefore when I saw it I removed them.
20814	26	16	51	Samaria has not committed half the sins you have; you have done more abominable deeds than they did. You have made your sisters appear righteous with all the abominable things you have done.
20815	26	16	52	So now, bear your disgrace, because you have given your sisters reason to justify their behavior. Because the sins you have committed were more abominable than those of your sisters; they have become more righteous than you. So now, be ashamed and bear the disgrace of making your sisters appear righteous.
20816	26	16	53	¶“‘I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters (along with your fortunes among them),
20817	26	16	54	so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in consoling them.
20818	26	16	55	As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters will be restored to their former status, Samaria and her daughters will be restored to their former status, and you and your daughters will be restored to your former status.
20819	26	16	56	In your days of majesty, was not Sodom your sister a byword in your mouth,
20820	26	16	57	before your evil was exposed? Now you have become an object of scorn to the daughters of Aram and all those around her and to the daughters of the Philistines – those all around you who despise you.
20821	26	16	58	You must bear your punishment for your obscene conduct and your abominable practices, declares the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20822	26	16	59	¶“‘For this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: I will deal with you according to what you have done when you despised your oath by breaking your covenant.
20823	26	16	60	Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish a lasting covenant with you.
20824	26	16	61	Then you will remember your conduct, and be ashamed when you receive your older and younger sisters. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on account of my covenant with you.
20825	26	16	62	I will establish my covenant with you, and then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20826	26	16	63	Then you will remember, be ashamed, and remain silent because of your disgrace when I make atonement for all you have done, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
20827	26	17	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20828	26	17	2	“Son of man, offer a riddle, and tell a parable to the house of Israel.
20829	26	17	3	Say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‡“‘A great eagle with broad wings, long feathers, ‡with full plumage which was multi-hued, ‡came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar.

20831	26	17	5	‡He took one of the seedlings of the land, ‡placed it in a cultivated plot; ‡a shoot by abundant water,‡like a willow he planted it.
20832	26	17	6	‡It sprouted and became a vine,‡spreading low to the ground; ‡its branches turning toward him, its roots were under itself. ‡So it became a vine; it produced shoots and sent out branches.
20833	26	17	7	‡“‘There was another great eagle ‡with broad wings and thick plumage. ‡Now this vine twisted its roots toward him ‡and sent its branches toward him‡to be watered from the soil where it was planted.

20837	26	17	11	¶Then <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:

20839	26	17	13	He took one from the royal family, made a treaty with him, and put him under oath. He then took the leaders of the land
20840	26	17	14	so it would be a lowly kingdom which could not rise on its own but must keep its treaty with him in order to stand.
20841	26	17	15	But this one from Israel’s royal family rebelled against the king of Babylon by sending his emissaries to Egypt to obtain horses and a large army. Will he prosper? Will the one doing these things escape? Can he break the covenant and escape?

20861	26	18	11	(though the father did not do any of them). He eats pagan sacrifices on the mountains, defiles his neighbor’s wife,
20862	26	18	12	oppresses the poor and the needy, commits robbery, does not give back what was given in pledge, prays to idols, performs abominable acts,
20863	26	18	13	engages in usury and charges interest. Will he live? He will not! Because he has done all these abominable deeds he will certainly die. He will bear the responsibility for his own death.
20864	26	18	14	¶“But suppose he in turn has a son who notices all the sins his father commits, considers them, and does not follow his father’s example.
20865	26	18	15	He does not eat pagan sacrifices on the mountains, does not pray to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor’s wife,
20866	26	18	16	does not oppress anyone or keep what has been given in pledge, does not commit robbery, gives his food to the hungry, and clothes the naked,
20867	26	18	17	refrains from wrongdoing, does not engage in usury or charge interest, carries out my regulations and follows my statutes. He will not die for his father’s iniquity; he will surely live.
20868	26	18	18	As for his father, because he practices extortion, robs his brother, and does what is not good among his people, he will die for his iniquity.
20869	26	18	19	¶“Yet you say, ‘Why should the son not suffer for his father’s iniquity?’ When the son does what is just and right, and observes all my statutes and carries them out, he will surely live.
20870	26	18	20	The person who sins is the one who will die. A son will not suffer for his father’s iniquity, and a father will not suffer for his son’s iniquity; the righteous person will be judged according to his righteousness, and the wicked person according to his wickedness.
20871	26	18	21	¶“But if the wicked person turns from all the sin he has committed and observes all my statutes and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die.
20872	26	18	22	None of the sins he has committed will be held against him; because of the righteousness he has done, he will live.
20873	26	18	23	Do I actually delight in the death of the wicked, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>? Do I not prefer that he turn from his wicked conduct and live?
20874	26	18	24	¶“But if a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and practices wrongdoing according to all the abominable practices the wicked carry out, will he live? All his righteous acts will not be remembered; because of the unfaithful acts he has done and the sin he has committed, he will die.
20875	26	18	25	¶“Yet you say, ‘The Lord’s conduct is unjust!’ Hear, O house of Israel: Is my conduct unjust? Is it not your conduct that is unjust?
20876	26	18	26	When a righteous person turns back from his righteousness and practices wrongdoing, he will die for it; because of the wrongdoing he has done, he will die.
20877	26	18	27	When a wicked person turns from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will preserve his life.
20878	26	18	28	Because he considered and turned from all the sins he had done, he will surely live; he will not die.
20879	26	18	29	Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The Lord’s conduct is unjust!’ Is my conduct unjust, O house of Israel? Is it not your conduct that is unjust?
20880	26	18	30	¶“Therefore I will judge each person according to his conduct, O house of Israel, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Repent and turn from all your wickedness; then it will not be an obstacle leading to iniquity.
20881	26	18	31	Throw away all your sins you have committed and fashion yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why should you die, O house of Israel?
20882	26	18	32	For I take no delight in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Repent and live!
20883	26	19	1	¶“And you, sing a lament for the princes of Israel,
20884	26	19	2	and say: ‡“‘What a lioness was your mother among the lions!‡She lay among young lions; she reared her cubs.
20885	26	19	3	‡She reared one of her cubs; he became a young lion.‡He learned to tear prey; he devoured people.
20886	26	19	4	‡The nations heard about him; he was trapped in their pit.‡They brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
20887	26	19	5	‡“‘When she realized that she waited in vain, her hope was lost. ‡She took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.
20888	26	19	6	‡He walked about among the lions; he became a young lion.‡He learned to tear prey; he devoured people.
20889	26	19	7	‡He broke down their strongholds and devastated their cities.‡The land and everything in it was frightened at the sound of his roaring.
20890	26	19	8	‡The nations – the surrounding regions – attacked him.‡They threw their net over him; he was caught in their pit.
20891	26	19	9	‡They put him in a collar with hooks; ‡they brought him to the king of Babylon;‡they brought him to prison ‡so that his voice would not be heard ‡any longer on the mountains of Israel.
20892	26	19	10	‡“‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by water.‡It was fruitful and full of branches because it was well-watered.
20893	26	19	11	‡Its boughs were strong, fit for rulers’ scepters; it reached up into the clouds.‡It stood out because of its height and its many branches.
20894	26	19	12	‡But it was plucked up in anger; it was thrown down to the ground.‡The east wind dried up its fruit;‡its strong branches broke off and withered – ‡a fire consumed them.
20895	26	19	13	‡Now it is planted in the wilderness,‡in a dry and thirsty land.
20896	26	19	14	‡A fire has gone out from its branch; it has consumed its shoot and its fruit. ‡No strong branch was left in it, nor a scepter to rule.’ ¶This is a lament song, and has become a lament song.”
20897	26	20	1	¶In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, some of the elders of Israel came to seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and they sat down in front of me.
20898	26	20	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20899	26	20	3	“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Are you coming to seek me? As surely as I live, I will not allow you to seek me, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’
20900	26	20	4	“Are you willing to pronounce judgment on them? Are you willing to pronounce judgment, son of man? Then confront them with the abominable practices of their fathers,
20901	26	20	5	and say to them: ¶“‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: On the day I chose Israel I swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt. I swore to them, “I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.”
20902	26	20	6	On that day I swore to bring them out of the land of Egypt to a land which I had picked out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands.
20903	26	20	7	I said to them, “Each of you must get rid of the detestable idols you keep before you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.”
20904	26	20	8	But they rebelled against me, and refused to listen to me; no one got rid of their detestable idols, nor did they abandon the idols of Egypt. Then I decided to pour out my rage on them and fully vent my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
20905	26	20	9	I acted for the sake of my reputation, so that I would not be profaned before the nations among whom they lived, before whom I revealed myself by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
20906	26	20	10	¶“‘So I brought them out of the land of Egypt and led them to the wilderness.
20907	26	20	11	I gave them my statutes and revealed my regulations to them. The one who carries them out will live by them!
20908	26	20	12	I also gave them my Sabbaths as a reminder of our relationship, so that they would know that I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> sanctify them.
20909	26	20	13	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; they did not follow my statutes and they rejected my regulations (the one who obeys them will live by them), and they utterly desecrated my Sabbaths. So I decided to pour out my rage on them in the wilderness and destroy them.
20910	26	20	14	I acted for the sake of my reputation, so that I would not be profaned before the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
20911	26	20	15	I also swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them to the land I had given them – a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands.
20912	26	20	16	I did this because they rejected my regulations, did not follow my statutes, and desecrated my Sabbaths; for their hearts followed their idols.
20913	26	20	17	Yet I had pity on them and did not destroy them, so I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.
20914	26	20	18	¶“‘But I said to their children in the wilderness, “Do not follow the practices of your fathers; do not observe their regulations, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
20915	26	20	19	I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God; follow my statutes, observe my regulations, and carry them out.
20916	26	20	20	Treat my Sabbaths as holy and they will be a reminder of our relationship, and then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.”
20917	26	20	21	“‘But the children rebelled against me, did not follow my statutes, did not observe my regulations by carrying them out (the one who obeys them will live by them), and desecrated my Sabbaths. I decided to pour out my rage on them and fully vent my anger against them in the wilderness.
20918	26	20	22	But I refrained from doing so, and acted instead for the sake of my reputation, so that I would not be profaned before the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
20919	26	20	23	I also swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands.
20920	26	20	24	I did this because they did not observe my regulations, they rejected my statutes, they desecrated my Sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed on their fathers’ idols.
20921	26	20	25	I also gave them decrees which were not good and regulations by which they could not live.
20922	26	20	26	I declared them to be defiled because of their sacrifices – they caused all their firstborn to pass through the fire – so that I would devastate them, so that they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’
20923	26	20	27	¶“Therefore, speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: In this way too your fathers blasphemed me when they were unfaithful to me.
20924	26	20	28	I brought them to the land which I swore to give them, but whenever they saw any high hill or leafy tree, they offered their sacrifices there and presented the offerings that provoke me to anger. They offered their soothing aroma there and poured out their drink offerings.
20925	26	20	29	So I said to them, What is this high place you go to?’” (So it is called “High Place” to this day.)
20926	26	20	30	¶“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Will you defile yourselves like your fathers and engage in prostitution with detestable idols?
20927	26	20	31	When you present your sacrifices – when you make your sons pass through the fire – you defile yourselves with all your idols to this very day. Will I allow you to seek me, O house of Israel? As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I will not allow you to seek me!
20928	26	20	32	¶“‘What you plan will never happen. You say, “We will be like the nations, like the clans of the lands, who serve gods of wood and stone.”
20929	26	20	33	As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, with a powerful hand and an outstretched arm, and with an outpouring of rage, I will be king over you.
20930	26	20	34	I will bring you out from the nations, and will gather you from the lands where you are scattered, with a powerful hand and an outstretched arm and with an outpouring of rage!
20931	26	20	35	I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
20932	26	20	36	Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20933	26	20	37	I will make you pass under the shepherd’s staff, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
20934	26	20	38	I will eliminate from among you the rebels and those who revolt against me. I will bring them out from the land where they have been residing, but they will not come to the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
20935	26	20	39	¶“‘As for you, O house of Israel, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Each of you go and serve your idols, if you will not listen to me. But my holy name will not be profaned again by your sacrifices and your idols.
20936	26	20	40	For there on my holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, all the house of Israel will serve me, all of them in the land. I will accept them there, and there I will seek your contributions and your choice gifts, with all your holy things.
20937	26	20	41	When I bring you out from the nations and gather you from the lands where you are scattered, I will accept you along with your soothing aroma. I will display my holiness among you in the sight of the nations.
20938	26	20	42	Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> when I bring you to the land of Israel, to the land I swore to give to your fathers.
20939	26	20	43	And there you will remember your conduct and all your deeds by which you defiled yourselves. You will despise yourselves because of all the evil deeds you have done.
20940	26	20	44	Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, when I deal with you for the sake of my reputation and not according to your wicked conduct and corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
20941	26	20	45	¶(21:1) The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20942	26	20	46	“Son of man, turn toward the south, and speak out against the south. Prophesy against the open scrub land of the Negev,
20943	26	20	47	and say to the scrub land of the Negev, ‘Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message: This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord </span> has said: Look here, I am about to start a fire in you, and it will devour every green tree and every dry tree in you. The flaming fire will not be extinguished, and the whole surface of the ground from the Negev to the north will be scorched by it.
20944	26	20	48	And everyone will see that I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> have burned it; it will not be extinguished.’”
20945	26	20	49	¶Then I said, “O Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! They are saying of me, ‘Does he not simply speak in eloquent figures of speech?’”
20946	26	21	1	¶(21:6) The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20947	26	21	2	“Son of man, turn toward Jerusalem and speak out against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel
20948	26	21	3	and say to them, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I am against you. I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
20949	26	21	4	Because I will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked, my sword will go out from its sheath against everyone from the south to the north.
20950	26	21	5	Then everyone will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> who drew my sword from its sheath – it will not be sheathed again!’
20951	26	21	6	¶“And you, son of man, groan with an aching heart and bitterness; groan before their eyes.
20952	26	21	7	When they ask you, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you will reply, ‘Because of the report that has come. Every heart will melt with fear and every hand will be limp; everyone will faint and every knee will be wet with urine.’ Pay attention – it is coming and it will happen, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
20953	26	21	8	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20954	26	21	9	“Son of man, prophesy and say: ‘This is what the Lord says:‡“‘A sword, a sword is sharpened,‡and also polished.
20955	26	21	10	‡It is sharpened for slaughter, ‡it is polished to flash like lightning!¶“‘Should we rejoice in the scepter of my son? No! The sword despises every tree!
20956	26	21	11	‡“‘He gave it to be polished,‡to be grasped in the hand – ‡the sword is sharpened, it is polished – ‡giving it into the hand of the executioner.
20957	26	21	12	‡Cry out and moan, son of man,‡for it is wielded against my people;‡against all the princes of Israel.‡They are delivered up to the sword, along with my people.‡Therefore, strike your thigh.
20958	26	21	13	¶“‘For testing will come, and what will happen when the scepter, which the sword despises, is no more? declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>’
20959	26	21	14	‡“And you, son of man, prophesy, ‡and clap your hands together.‡Let the sword strike twice, even three times!‡It is a sword for slaughter,‡a sword for the great slaughter surrounding them.
20960	26	21	15	‡So hearts melt with fear and many stumble.‡At all their gates I have stationed the sword for slaughter.‡Ah! It is made to flash, it is drawn for slaughter!
20961	26	21	16	‡Cut sharply on the right!‡Swing to the left, ‡wherever your edge is appointed to strike.
20962	26	21	17	‡I too will clap my hands together,‡I will exhaust my rage;‡I the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> have spoken.”
20963	26	21	18	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
20964	26	21	19	“You, son of man, mark out two routes for the king of Babylon’s sword to take; both of them will originate in a single land. Make a signpost and put it at the beginning of the road leading to the city.
20965	26	21	20	Mark out the routes for the sword to take: “Rabbah of the Ammonites” and “Judah with Jerusalem in it.”
20966	26	21	21	For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road at the head of the two routes. He looks for omens: He shakes arrows, he consults idols, he examines animal livers.
20967	26	21	22	Into his right hand comes the portent for Jerusalem – to set up battering rams, to give the signal for slaughter, to shout out the battle cry, to set up battering rams against the gates, to erect a siege ramp, to build a siege wall.
20968	26	21	23	But those in Jerusalem will view it as a false omen. They have sworn solemn oaths, but the king of Babylon will accuse them of violations in order to seize them.
20969	26	21	24	¶“Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‘Because you have brought up your own guilt by uncovering your transgressions and revealing your sins through all your actions, for this reason you will be taken by force.

20985	26	22	8	You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths!
20986	26	22	9	Slanderous men shed blood within you. Those who live within you eat pagan sacrifices on the mountains; they commit obscene acts among you.
20987	26	22	10	They have sexual relations with their father’s wife within you; they violate women during their menstrual period within you.
20988	26	22	11	One commits an abominable act with his neighbor’s wife; another obscenely defiles his daughter-in-law; another violates his sister – his father’s daughter – within you.
20989	26	22	12	They take bribes within you to shed blood. You engage in usury and charge interest; you extort money from your neighbors. You have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.

20994	26	22	17	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:

21003	26	22	26	Her priests abuse my law and have desecrated my holy things. They do not distinguish between the holy and the profane, or recognize any distinction between the unclean and the clean. They ignore my Sabbaths and I am profaned in their midst.
21004	26	22	27	Her officials are like wolves in her midst rending their prey – shedding blood and destroying lives – so they can get dishonest profit.
21005	26	22	28	Her prophets coat their messages with whitewash. They see false visions and announce lying omens for them, saying, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,’ when the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has not spoken.
21006	26	22	29	The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have wronged the poor and needy; they have oppressed the resident foreigner and denied them justice.
21007	26	22	30	¶“I looked for a man from among them who would repair the wall and stand in the gap before me on behalf of the land, so that I would not destroy it, but I found no one.
21008	26	22	31	So I have poured my anger on them, and destroyed them with the fire of my fury. I hereby repay them for what they have done, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
21009	26	23	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21010	26	23	2	“Son of man, there were two women who were daughters of the same mother.
21011	26	23	3	They engaged in prostitution in Egypt; in their youth they engaged in prostitution. Their breasts were squeezed there; lovers fondled their virgin nipples there.
21012	26	23	4	Oholah was the name of the older and Oholibah the name of her younger sister. They became mine, and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
21013	26	23	5	¶“Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was mine. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians – warriors
21014	26	23	6	clothed in blue, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
21015	26	23	7	She bestowed her sexual favors on them; all of them were the choicest young men of Assyria. She defiled herself with all whom she desired – with all their idols.
21016	26	23	8	She did not abandon the prostitution she had practiced in Egypt; for in her youth men went to bed with her, fondled her virgin breasts, and ravished her.
21017	26	23	9	Therefore I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians for whom she lusted.
21018	26	23	10	They exposed her nakedness, seized her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. She became notorious among women, and they executed judgments against her.
21019	26	23	11	¶“Her sister Oholibah watched this, but she became more corrupt in her lust than her sister had been, and her acts of prostitution were more numerous than those of her sister.
21020	26	23	12	She lusted after the Assyrians – governors and officials, warriors in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.
21021	26	23	13	I saw that she was defiled; both of them followed the same path.
21022	26	23	14	But she increased her prostitution. She saw men carved on the wall, images of the Chaldeans carved in bright red,
21023	26	23	15	wearing belts on their waists and flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, the image of Babylonians whose native land is Chaldea.
21024	26	23	16	When she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
21025	26	23	17	The Babylonians crawled into bed with her. They defiled her with their lust; after she was defiled by them, she became disgusted with them.
21026	26	23	18	When she lustfully exposed her nakedness, I was disgusted with her, just as I had been disgusted with her sister.
21027	26	23	19	Yet she increased her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth when she engaged in prostitution in the land of Egypt.
21028	26	23	20	She lusted after her lovers there, whose genitals were like those of donkeys, and whose emission was like that of stallions.
21029	26	23	21	This is how you assessed the obscene conduct of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your nipples and squeezed your young breasts.
21030	26	23	22	¶“Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look here, I am about to stir up against you the lovers with whom you were disgusted; I will bring them against you from every side:
21031	26	23	23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, all of them governors and officials, officers and nobles, all of them riding on horses.
21032	26	23	24	They will attack you with weapons, chariots, wagons, and with a huge army; they will array themselves against you on every side with large shields, small shields, and helmets. I will assign them the task of judgment; they will punish you according to their laws.
21033	26	23	25	I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in rage. They will cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors will die by the sword. They will seize your sons and daughters, and your survivors will be consumed by fire.
21034	26	23	26	They will strip your clothes off you and take away your beautiful jewelry.
21035	26	23	27	So I will put an end to your obscene conduct and your prostitution which you have practiced in the land of Egypt. You will not seek their help or remember Egypt anymore.
21036	26	23	28	¶“For this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look here, I am about to deliver you over to those whom you hate, to those with whom you were disgusted.
21037	26	23	29	They will treat you with hatred, take away all you have labored for, and leave you naked and bare. Your nakedness will be exposed, just as when you engaged in prostitution and obscene conduct.
21038	26	23	30	I will do these things to you because you engaged in prostitution with the nations, polluting yourself with their idols.
21039	26	23	31	You have followed the ways of your sister, so I will place her cup of judgment in your hand.
21040	26	23	32	“This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: “You will drink your sister’s deep and wide cup; you will be scorned and derided, for it holds a great deal.
21041	26	23	33	You will be overcome by drunkenness and sorrow. The cup of your sister Samaria is a cup of horror and desolation.
21042	26	23	34	You will drain it dry, gnaw its pieces, and tear out your breasts, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21043	26	23	35	¶“Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Because you have forgotten me and completely disregarded me, you must bear now the punishment for your obscene conduct and prostitution.”
21044	26	23	36	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me: “Son of man, are you willing to pronounce judgment on Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominable deeds!
21045	26	23	37	For they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and their sons, whom they bore to me, they have passed through the fire as food to their idols.
21046	26	23	38	Moreover, they have done this to me: In the very same day they desecrated my sanctuary and profaned my Sabbaths.
21047	26	23	39	On the same day they slaughtered their sons for their idols, they came to my sanctuary to desecrate it. This is what they have done in the middle of my house.
21048	26	23	40	¶“They even sent for men from far away; when the messenger arrived, those men set out. For them you bathed, painted your eyes, and decorated yourself with jewelry.
21049	26	23	41	You sat on a magnificent couch, with a table arranged in front of it where you placed my incense and my olive oil.
21050	26	23	42	The sound of a carefree crowd accompanied her, including all kinds of men; even Sabeans were brought from the desert. The sisters put bracelets on their wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads.
21051	26	23	43	Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, ‘Now they will commit immoral acts with her.’
21052	26	23	44	They slept with her the way someone sleeps with a prostitute. In this way they slept with Oholah and Oholibah, promiscuous women.
21053	26	23	45	But upright men will punish them appropriately for their adultery and bloodshed, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.
21054	26	23	46	¶“For this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Bring up an army against them and subject them to terror and plunder.
21055	26	23	47	That army will pelt them with stones and slash them with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses.
21056	26	23	48	I will put an end to the obscene conduct in the land; all the women will learn a lesson from this and not engage in obscene conduct.
21057	26	23	49	They will repay you for your obscene conduct, and you will be punished for idol worship. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
21058	26	24	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month :
21059	26	24	2	“Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
21060	26	24	3	Recite a proverb to this rebellious house and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“‘Set on the pot, set it on, ‡pour water in it too;
21061	26	24	4	‡add the pieces of meat to it, ‡every good piece,‡the thigh and the shoulder;‡fill it with choice bones.
21062	26	24	5	‡Take the choice bone of the flock,‡heap up wood under it;‡boil rapidly,‡and boil its bones in it.
21063	26	24	6	‡“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡Woe to the city of bloodshed,‡the pot whose rot is in it,‡whose rot has not been removed from it!‡Empty it piece by piece.‡No lot has fallen on it.
21064	26	24	7	‡For her blood was in it;‡she poured it on an exposed rock;‡she did not pour it on the ground to cover it up with dust.
21065	26	24	8	‡To arouse anger, to take vengeance,‡I have placed her blood on an exposed rock so that it cannot be covered up.
21066	26	24	9	‡“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‡Woe to the city of bloodshed!‡I will also make the pile high.
21067	26	24	10	‡Pile up the wood, kindle the fire;‡cook the meat well, mix in the spices,‡let the bones be charred.
21068	26	24	11	‡Set the empty pot on the coals, ‡until it becomes hot and its copper glows,‡until its uncleanness melts within it and its rot is consumed.
21069	26	24	12	‡It has tried my patience; ‡yet its thick rot is not removed from it.‡Subject its rot to the fire!
21070	26	24	13	‡You mix uncleanness with obscene conduct. ‡I tried to cleanse you, but you are not clean.‡You will not be cleansed from your uncleanness ‡until I have exhausted my anger on you.
21071	26	24	14	¶“‘I the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> have spoken; judgment is coming and I will act! I will not relent, or show pity, or be sorry! I will judge you according to your conduct and your deeds, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
21072	26	24	15	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21073	26	24	16	“Son of man, realize that I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you with a jolt, but you must not mourn or weep or shed tears.
21074	26	24	17	Groan to moan for the dead, but do not perform mourning rites. Bind on your turban and put your sandals on your feet. Do not cover your lip and do not eat food brought by others.”
21075	26	24	18	¶So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. In the morning I acted just as I was commanded.
21076	26	24	19	Then the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things you are doing mean for us?”
21077	26	24	20	¶So I said to them: “The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21078	26	24	21	Say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Realize I am about to desecrate my sanctuary – the source of your confident pride, the object in which your eyes delight, and your life’s passion. Your very own sons and daughters whom you have left behind will die by the sword.
21079	26	24	22	Then you will do as I have done: You will not cover your lip or eat food brought by others.
21080	26	24	23	Your turbans will be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you will not mourn or weep, but you will rot for your iniquities and groan among yourselves.
21081	26	24	24	Ezekiel will be an object lesson for you; you will do all that he has done. When it happens, then you will know that I am the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’
21082	26	24	25	¶“And you, son of man, this is what will happen on the day I take from them their stronghold – their beautiful source of joy, the object in which their eyes delight, and the main concern of their lives, as well as their sons and daughters:
21083	26	24	26	On that day a fugitive will come to you to report the news.
21084	26	24	27	On that day you will be able to speak again; you will talk with the fugitive and be silent no longer. You will be an object lesson for them, and they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
21085	26	25	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21086	26	25	2	“Son of man, turn toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
21087	26	25	3	Say to the Ammonites, ‘Hear the word of the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: You said “Aha!” about my sanctuary when it was desecrated, about the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and about the house of Judah when they went into exile.
21088	26	25	4	So take note, I am about to make you slaves of the tribes of the east. They will make camps among you and pitch their tents among you. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
21089	26	25	5	I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21090	26	25	6	For this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Because you clapped your hands, stamped your feet, and rejoiced with intense scorn over the land of Israel,
21091	26	25	7	take note, I have stretched out my hand against you, and I will hand you over as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from the lands. I will destroy you; then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
21092	26	25	8	¶“This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‘Moab and Seir say, “Look, the house of Judah is like all the other nations.”
21093	26	25	9	So look, I am about to open up Moab’s flank, eliminating the cities, including its frontier cities, the beauty of the land – Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim.
21094	26	25	10	I will hand it over, along with the Ammonites, to the tribes of the east, so that the Ammonites will no longer be remembered among the nations.
21095	26	25	11	I will execute judgments against Moab. Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
21096	26	25	12	¶“This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‘Edom has taken vengeance against the house of Judah; they have made themselves fully culpable by taking vengeance on them.
21097	26	25	13	So this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom, and I will kill the people and animals within her, and I will make her desolate; from Teman to Dedan they will die by the sword.
21098	26	25	14	I will exact my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel. They will carry out in Edom my anger and rage; they will experience my vengeance, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
21099	26	25	15	¶“This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‘The Philistines have exacted merciless revenge, showing intense scorn in their effort to destroy Judah with unrelenting hostility.
21100	26	25	16	So this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Take note, I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines. I will kill the Cherethites and destroy those who remain on the seacoast.
21101	26	25	17	I will exact great vengeance upon them with angry rebukes. Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, when I exact my vengeance upon them.’”
21102	26	26	1	¶In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21103	26	26	2	“Son of man, because Tyre has said about Jerusalem, ‘Aha, the gateway of the peoples is broken; it has swung open to me. I will become rich, now that she has been destroyed,’
21104	26	26	3	therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I am against you, O Tyre! I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.
21105	26	26	4	They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers. I will scrape her soil from her and make her a bare rock.
21106	26	26	5	She will be a place where fishing nets are spread, surrounded by the sea. For I have spoken, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. She will become plunder for the nations,
21107	26	26	6	and her daughters who are in the field will be slaughtered by the sword. Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21108	26	26	7	¶“For this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Take note that I am about to bring King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, king of kings, against Tyre from the north, with horses, chariots, and horsemen, an army and hordes of people.
21109	26	26	8	He will kill your daughters in the field with the sword. He will build a siege wall against you, erect a siege ramp against you, and raise a great shield against you.
21110	26	26	9	He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and tear down your towers with his weapons.
21111	26	26	10	He will cover you with the dust kicked up by his many horses. Your walls will shake from the noise of the horsemen, wheels, and chariots when he enters your gates like those who invade through a city’s broken walls.
21112	26	26	11	With his horses’ hoofs he will trample all your streets. He will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will tumble down to the ground.
21113	26	26	12	They will steal your wealth and loot your merchandise. They will tear down your walls and destroy your luxurious homes. Your stones, your trees, and your soil he will throw into the water.
21114	26	26	13	I will silence the noise of your songs; the sound of your harps will be heard no more.
21115	26	26	14	I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place where fishing nets are spread. You will never be built again, for I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> have spoken, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21116	26	26	15	¶“This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to Tyre: Oh, how the coastlands will shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, at the massive slaughter in your midst!
21117	26	26	16	All the princes of the sea will vacate their thrones. They will remove their robes and strip off their embroidered clothes; they will clothe themselves with trembling. They will sit on the ground; they will tremble continually and be shocked at what has happened to you.
21118	26	26	17	They will sing this lament over you: ‡“‘How you have perished – you have vanished from the seas,‡O renowned city, once mighty in the sea,‡she and her inhabitants, who spread their terror!
21119	26	26	18	‡Now the coastlands will tremble on the day of your fall; ‡the coastlands by the sea will be terrified by your passing.’
21120	26	26	19	¶“For this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: When I make you desolate like the uninhabited cities, when I bring up the deep over you and the surging waters overwhelm you,
21121	26	26	20	then I will bring you down to bygone people, to be with those who descend to the Pit. I will make you live in the lower parts of the earth, among the primeval ruins, with those who descend to the Pit, so that you will not be inhabited or stand in the land of the living.
21122	26	26	21	I will bring terrors on you, and you will be no more! Though you are sought after, you will never be found again, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
21123	26	27	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21124	26	27	2	“You, son of man, sing a lament for Tyre.
21125	26	27	3	Say to Tyre, who sits at the entrance of the sea, merchant to the peoples on many coasts, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“‘O Tyre, you have said, “I am perfectly beautiful.”
21126	26	27	4	‡Your borders are in the heart of the seas;‡your builders have perfected your beauty.
21127	26	27	5	‡They crafted all your planks out of fir trees from Senir; ‡they took a cedar from Lebanon to make your mast.
21128	26	27	6	‡They made your oars from oaks of Bashan;‡they made your deck with cypress wood from the coasts of Cyprus.
21129	26	27	7	‡Fine linen from Egypt, woven with patterns, was used for your sail‡to serve as your banner;‡blue and purple from the coastlands of Elishah was used for your deck’s awning.
21130	26	27	8	‡The leaders of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers;‡your skilled men, O Tyre, were your captains.
21131	26	27	9	‡The elders of Gebal and her skilled men were within you, mending cracks; ‡all the ships of the sea and their mariners were within you to trade for your merchandise.
21132	26	27	10	‡Men of Persia, Lud, and Put were in your army, men of war.‡They hung shield and helmet on you; they gave you your splendor.
21133	26	27	11	‡The Arvadites joined your army on your walls all around,‡and the Gammadites were in your towers. ‡They hung their quivers on your walls all around; ‡they perfected your beauty.
21134	26	27	12	¶“‘Tarshish was your trade partner because of your abundant wealth; they exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your products.
21135	26	27	13	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your clients; they exchanged slaves and bronze items for your merchandise.
21136	26	27	14	Beth Togarmah exchanged horses, chargers, and mules for your products.
21137	26	27	15	The Dedanites were your clients. Many coastlands were your customers; they paid you with ivory tusks and ebony.
21138	26	27	16	Edom was your trade partner because of the abundance of your goods; they exchanged turquoise, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies for your products.
21139	26	27	17	Judah and the land of Israel were your clients; they traded wheat from Minnith, millet, honey, olive oil, and balm for your merchandise.
21140	26	27	18	Damascus was your trade partner because of the abundance of your goods and of all your wealth: wine from Helbon, white wool from Zahar,
21141	26	27	19	and casks of wine from Izal they exchanged for your products. Wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane were among your merchandise.
21142	26	27	20	Dedan was your client in saddlecloths for riding.
21143	26	27	21	Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your trade partners; for lambs, rams, and goats they traded with you.
21144	26	27	22	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah engaged in trade with you; they traded the best kinds of spices along with precious stones and gold for your products.
21145	26	27	23	Haran, Kanneh, Eden, merchants from Sheba, Asshur, and Kilmad were your clients.
21146	26	27	24	They traded with you choice garments, purple clothes and embroidered work, and multicolored carpets, bound and reinforced with cords; these were among your merchandise.
21147	26	27	25	The ships of Tarshish were the transports for your merchandise. ‡“‘So you were filled and weighed down in the heart of the seas.
21148	26	27	26	‡Your rowers have brought you into surging waters.‡The east wind has wrecked you in the heart of the seas.
21149	26	27	27	‡Your wealth, products, and merchandise, your sailors and captains, ‡your ship’s carpenters, your merchants, ‡and all your fighting men within you, ‡along with all your crew who are in you,‡will fall into the heart of the seas on the day of your downfall.
21150	26	27	28	‡At the sound of your captains’ cry the waves will surge;
21151	26	27	29	‡They will descend from their ships – all who handle the oar, ‡the sailors and all the sea captains – they will stand on the land.
21152	26	27	30	‡They will lament loudly over you and cry bitterly. ‡They will throw dust on their heads and roll in the ashes;
21153	26	27	31	‡they will tear out their hair because of you and put on sackcloth, ‡and they will weep bitterly over you with intense mourning.
21154	26	27	32	‡As they wail they will lament over you, chanting:‡“Who was like Tyre, like a tower in the midst of the sea?”
21155	26	27	33	‡When your products went out from the seas,‡you satisfied many peoples;‡with the abundance of your wealth and merchandise‡you enriched the kings of the earth.
21156	26	27	34	‡Now you are wrecked by the seas, in the depths of the waters;‡your merchandise and all your company have sunk along with you.

21236	26	31	5	‡Therefore it grew taller than all the trees of the field;‡its boughs grew large and its branches grew long,‡because of the plentiful water in its shoots.
21237	26	31	6	‡All the birds of the sky nested in its boughs;‡under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth,‡in its shade all the great nations lived.
21238	26	31	7	‡It was beautiful in its loftiness, in the length of its branches;‡for its roots went down deep to plentiful waters.

21245	26	31	14	For this reason no watered trees will grow so tall; their tops will not reach into the clouds, nor will the well-watered ones grow that high.

21294	26	33	13	Suppose I tell the righteous that he will certainly live, but he becomes confident in his righteousness and commits iniquity. None of his righteous deeds will be remembered; because of the iniquity he has committed he will die.
21295	26	33	14	Suppose I say to the wicked, ‘You must certainly die,’ but he turns from his sin and does what is just and right.
21296	26	33	15	He returns what was taken in pledge, pays back what he has stolen, and follows the statutes that give life, committing no iniquity. He will certainly live – he will not die.
21297	26	33	16	None of the sins he has committed will be counted against him. He has done what is just and right; he will certainly live.
21298	26	33	17	¶“Yet your people say, ‘The behavior of the Lord is not right,’ when it is their behavior that is not right.
21299	26	33	18	When a righteous man turns from his godliness and commits iniquity, he will die for it.
21300	26	33	19	When the wicked turns from his sin and does what is just and right, he will live because of it.
21301	26	33	20	Yet you say, ‘The behavior of the Lord is not right.’ House of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his behavior.”
21302	26	33	21	¶In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth of the month, a refugee came to me from Jerusalem saying, “The city has been defeated!”
21303	26	33	22	Now the hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> had been on me the evening before the refugee reached me, but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> opened my mouth by the time the refugee arrived in the morning; he opened my mouth and I was no longer unable to speak.
21304	26	33	23	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21305	26	33	24	“Son of man, the ones living in these ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land, but we are many; surely the land has been given to us for a possession.’
21306	26	33	25	Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: You eat the meat with the blood still in it, pray to your idols, and shed blood. Do you really think you will possess the land?
21307	26	33	26	You rely on your swords and commit abominable deeds; each of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. Will you possess the land?’
21308	26	33	27	¶“This is what you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: As surely as I live, those living in the ruins will die by the sword, those in the open field I will give to the wild beasts for food, and those who are in the strongholds and caves will die of disease.
21309	26	33	28	I will turn the land into a desolate ruin; her confident pride will come to an end. The mountains of Israel will be so desolate no one will pass through them.
21310	26	33	29	Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> when I turn the land into a desolate ruin because of all the abominable deeds they have committed.’
21311	26	33	30	¶“But as for you, son of man, your people (who are talking about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses) say to one another, ‘Come hear the word that comes from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’
21312	26	33	31	They come to you in crowds, and they sit in front of you as my people. They hear your words, but do not obey them. For they talk lustfully, and their heart is set on their own advantage.
21313	26	33	32	Realize that to them you are like a sensual song, a beautiful voice and skilled musician. They hear your words, but they do not obey them.
21314	26	33	33	When all this comes true – and it certainly will – then they will know that a prophet was among them.”
21315	26	34	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21316	26	34	2	“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them – to the shepherds: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves! Should not shepherds feed the flock?
21317	26	34	3	You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the choice animals, but you do not feed the sheep!
21318	26	34	4	You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bandaged the injured, brought back the strays, or sought the lost, but with force and harshness you have ruled over them.
21319	26	34	5	They were scattered because they had no shepherd, and they became food for every wild beast.
21320	26	34	6	My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over the entire face of the earth with no one looking or searching for them.
21321	26	34	7	¶“‘Therefore, you shepherds, listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message:
21322	26	34	8	As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, my sheep have become prey and have become food for all the wild beasts. There was no shepherd, and my shepherds did not search for my flock, but fed themselves and did not feed my sheep,
21323	26	34	9	Therefore, you shepherds, listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message:
21324	26	34	10	This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I am against the shepherds, and I will demand my sheep from their hand. I will no longer let them be shepherds; the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore. I will rescue my sheep from their mouth, so that they will no longer be food for them.
21325	26	34	11	¶“‘For this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I myself will search for my sheep and seek them out.
21326	26	34	12	As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his scattered sheep, so I will seek out my flock. I will rescue them from all the places where they have been scattered on a cloudy, dark day.
21327	26	34	13	I will bring them out from among the peoples and gather them from foreign countries; I will bring them to their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams and all the inhabited places of the land.
21328	26	34	14	In a good pasture I will feed them; the mountain heights of Israel will be their pasture. There they will lie down in a lush pasture, and they will feed on rich grass on the mountains of Israel.
21329	26	34	15	I myself will feed my sheep and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21330	26	34	16	I will seek the lost and bring back the strays; I will bandage the injured and strengthen the sick, but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them – with judgment!
21331	26	34	17	¶“‘As for you, my sheep, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I am about to judge between one sheep and another, between rams and goats.
21332	26	34	18	Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must trample the rest of your pastures with your feet? When you drink clean water, must you muddy the rest of the water by trampling it with your feet?
21333	26	34	19	As for my sheep, they must eat what you trampled with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet!
21334	26	34	20	¶“‘Therefore, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to them: Look, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
21335	26	34	21	Because you push with your side and your shoulder, and thrust your horns at all the weak sheep until you scatter them abroad,
21336	26	34	22	I will save my sheep; they will no longer be prey. I will judge between one sheep and another.
21337	26	34	23	¶I will set one shepherd over them, and he will feed them – namely, my servant David. He will feed them and will be their shepherd.
21338	26	34	24	I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them; I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> have spoken!
21339	26	34	25	¶“‘I will make a covenant of peace with them and will rid the land of wild beasts, so that they can live securely in the wilderness and even sleep in the woods.
21340	26	34	26	I will turn them and the regions around my hill into a blessing. I will make showers come down in their season; they will be showers that bring blessing.
21341	26	34	27	The trees of the field will yield their fruit and the earth will yield its crops. They will live securely on their land; they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
21342	26	34	28	They will no longer be prey for the nations and the wild beasts will not devour them. They will live securely and no one will make them afraid.
21343	26	34	29	I will prepare for them a healthy planting. They will no longer be victims of famine in the land and will no longer bear the insults of the nations.
21344	26	34	30	Then they will know that I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God, am with them, and that they are my people, the house of Israel, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21345	26	34	31	And you, my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are my people, and I am your God, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
21346	26	35	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21347	26	35	2	“Son of man, turn toward Mount Seir, and prophesy against it.
21348	26	35	3	Say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‡“‘Look, I am against you, Mount Seir;‡I will stretch out my hand against you‡and turn you into a desolate ruin.
21349	26	35	4	‡I will lay waste your cities;‡and you will become desolate.‡Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!
21350	26	35	5	¶“‘You have shown unrelenting hostility and poured the people of Israel onto the blades of a sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of their final punishment.
21351	26	35	6	Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I will subject you to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.
21352	26	35	7	I will turn Mount Seir into a desolate ruin; I will cut off from it the one who passes through or returns.
21353	26	35	8	I will fill its mountains with its dead; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines, those killed by the sword will fall.
21354	26	35	9	I will turn you into a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21355	26	35	10	¶“‘You said, “These two nations, these two lands will be mine, and we will possess them,” – although the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was there –
21356	26	35	11	therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I will deal with you according to your anger, and according to your envy, by which you acted spitefully against them. I will reveal myself to them when I judge you.
21357	26	35	12	Then you will know that I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have heard all the insults you spoke against the mountains of Israel, saying, “They are desolate, they have been given to us for food.”
21358	26	35	13	You exalted yourselves against me with your speech and hurled many insults against me – I have heard them all!
21359	26	35	14	This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will turn you into a desolation.
21360	26	35	15	As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so will I deal with you – you will be desolate, Mount Seir, and all of Edom – all of it! Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
21361	26	36	1	¶“As for you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say: ‘O mountains of Israel, listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message!
21362	26	36	2	This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: The enemy has spoken against you, saying “Aha!” and, “The ancient heights have become our property!”’
21363	26	36	3	So prophesy and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Surely because they have made you desolate and crushed you from all directions, so that you have become the property of the rest of the nations, and have become the subject of gossip and slander among the people,
21364	26	36	4	therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>: This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to the mountains and hills, the ravines and valleys, and to the desolate ruins and the abandoned cities that have become prey and an object of derision to the rest of the nations round about –
21365	26	36	5	therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Surely I have spoken in the fire of my zeal against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who with great joy and utter contempt have made my land their property and prey, because of its pasture.’
21366	26	36	6	¶“Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, the ravines and valleys, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I have spoken in my zeal and in my anger, because you have endured the insults of the nations.
21367	26	36	7	So this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: I vow that the nations around you will endure insults as well.
21368	26	36	8	¶“‘But you, mountains of Israel, will grow your branches, and bear your fruit for my people Israel; for they will arrive soon.
21369	26	36	9	For indeed, I am on your side; I will turn to you, and you will be plowed and planted.
21370	26	36	10	I will multiply your people – the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities will be populated and the ruins rebuilt.
21371	26	36	11	I will increase the number of people and animals on you; they will increase and be fruitful. I will cause you to be inhabited as in ancient times, and will do more good for you than at the beginning of your history. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21372	26	36	12	I will lead people, my people Israel, across you; they will possess you and you will become their inheritance. No longer will you bereave them of their children.
21373	26	36	13	¶“‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Because they are saying to you, “You are a devourer of men, and bereave your nation of children,”
21374	26	36	14	therefore you will no longer devour people and no longer bereave your nation of children, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21375	26	36	15	I will no longer subject you to the nations’ insults; no longer will you bear the shame of the peoples, and no longer will you bereave your nation, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
21376	26	36	16	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21377	26	36	17	“Son of man, when the house of Israel was living on their own land, they defiled it by their behavior and their deeds. In my sight their behavior was like the uncleanness of a woman having her monthly period.
21378	26	36	18	So I poured my anger on them because of the blood they shed on the land and because of the idols with which they defiled it.
21379	26	36	19	I scattered them among the nations; they were dispersed throughout foreign countries. In accordance with their behavior and their deeds I judged them.
21380	26	36	20	But when they arrived in the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name. It was said of them, ‘These are the people of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, yet they have departed from his land.’
21381	26	36	21	I was concerned for my holy reputation which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they went.
21382	26	36	22	¶“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: It is not for your sake that I am about to act, O house of Israel, but for the sake of my holy reputation which you profaned among the nations where you went.
21383	26	36	23	I will magnify my great name that has been profaned among the nations, that you have profaned among them. The nations will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, when I magnify myself among you in their sight.
21384	26	36	24	¶“‘I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries; then I will bring you to your land.
21385	26	36	25	I will sprinkle you with pure water and you will be clean from all your impurities. I will purify you from all your idols.
21386	26	36	26	I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will remove the heart of stone from your body and give you a heart of flesh.
21387	26	36	27	I will put my Spirit within you; I will take the initiative and you will obey my statutes and carefully observe my regulations.
21388	26	36	28	Then you will live in the land I gave to your fathers; you will be my people, and I will be your God.
21389	26	36	29	I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and multiply it; I will not bring a famine on you.
21390	26	36	30	I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the produce of the fields, so that you will never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations.
21391	26	36	31	Then you will remember your evil behavior and your deeds which were not good; you will loathe yourselves on account of your sins and your abominable deeds.
21392	26	36	32	Understand that it is not for your sake I am about to act, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. Be ashamed and embarrassed by your behavior, O house of Israel.
21393	26	36	33	¶“‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: In the day I cleanse you from all your sins, I will populate the cities and the ruins will be rebuilt.
21394	26	36	34	The desolate land will be plowed, instead of being desolate in the sight of everyone who passes by.
21395	26	36	35	They will say, “This desolate land has become like the garden of Eden; the ruined, desolate, and destroyed cities are now fortified and inhabited.”
21396	26	36	36	Then the nations which remain around you will know that I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> have rebuilt the ruins and replanted what was desolate. I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have spoken – and I will do it!’
21397	26	36	37	¶“This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: I will allow the house of Israel to ask me to do this for them: I will multiply their people like sheep.
21398	26	36	38	Like the sheep for offerings, like the sheep of Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
21399	26	37	1	¶The hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and placed me in the midst of the valley, and it was full of bones.
21400	26	37	2	He made me walk all around among them. I realized there were a great many bones in the valley and they were very dry.
21401	26	37	3	He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I said to him, “Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you know.”
21402	26	37	4	Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them: ‘Dry bones, listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message.
21403	26	37	5	This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says to these bones: Look, I am about to infuse breath into you and you will live.
21404	26	37	6	I will put tendons on you and muscles over you and will cover you with skin; I will put breath in you and you will live. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
21405	26	37	7	¶So I prophesied as I was commanded. There was a sound when I prophesied – I heard a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to bone.
21406	26	37	8	As I watched, I saw tendons on them, then muscles appeared, and skin covered over them from above, but there was no breath in them.
21407	26	37	9	¶He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, – prophesy, son of man – and say to the breath: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these corpses so that they may live.’”
21408	26	37	10	So I prophesied as I was commanded, and the breath came into them; they lived and stood on their feet, an extremely great army.
21409	26	37	11	¶Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are all the house of Israel. Look, they are saying, ‘Our bones are dry, our hope has perished; we are cut off.’
21410	26	37	12	Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I am about to open your graves and will raise you from your graves, my people. I will bring you to the land of Israel.
21411	26	37	13	Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, when I open your graves and raise you from your graves, my people.
21412	26	37	14	I will place my breath in you and you will live; I will give you rest in your own land. Then you will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – I have spoken and I will act, declares the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’”
21413	26	37	15	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21414	26	37	16	“As for you, son of man, take one branch, and write on it, ‘For Judah, and for the Israelites associated with him.’ Then take another branch and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the branch of Ephraim and all the house of Israel associated with him.’
21415	26	37	17	Join them as one stick; they will be as one in your hand.
21416	26	37	18	When your people say to you, ‘Will you not tell us what these things mean?’
21417	26	37	19	tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I am about to take the branch of Joseph which is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel associated with him, and I will place them on the stick of Judah, and make them into one stick – they will be one in my hand.’
21418	26	37	20	The sticks you write on will be in your hand in front of them.
21419	26	37	21	Then tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I am about to take the Israelites from among the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from round about and bring them to their land.
21420	26	37	22	I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will rule over them all. They will never again be two nations and never again be divided into two kingdoms.
21421	26	37	23	They will not defile themselves with their idols, their detestable things, and all their rebellious deeds. I will save them from all their unfaithfulness by which they sinned. I will purify them; they will become my people and I will become their God.
21422	26	37	24	¶“‘My servant David will be king over them; there will be one shepherd for all of them. They will follow my regulations and carefully observe my statutes.
21423	26	37	25	They will live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob, in which your fathers lived; they will live in it – they and their children and their grandchildren forever. David my servant will be prince over them forever.
21424	26	37	26	I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be a perpetual covenant with them. I will establish them, increase their numbers, and place my sanctuary among them forever.
21425	26	37	27	My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people.
21426	26	37	28	Then, when my sanctuary is among them forever, the nations will know that I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> sanctify Israel.’”
21427	26	38	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to me:
21428	26	38	2	“Son of man, turn toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him
21429	26	38	3	and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
21430	26	38	4	I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and bring you out with all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them fully armed, a great company with shields of different types, all of them armed with swords.
21431	26	38	5	Persia, Ethiopia, and Put are with them, all of them with shields and helmets.
21432	26	38	6	They are joined by Gomer with all its troops, and by Beth Togarmah from the remote parts of the north with all its troops – many peoples are with you.
21433	26	38	7	¶“‘Be ready and stay ready, you and all your companies assembled around you, and be a guard for them.
21434	26	38	8	After many days you will be summoned; in the latter years you will come to a land restored from the ravages of war, from many peoples gathered on the mountains of Israel that had long been in ruins. Its people were brought out from the peoples, and all of them will be living securely.
21435	26	38	9	You will advance; you will come like a storm. You will be like a cloud covering the earth, you, all your troops, and the many other peoples with you.
21436	26	38	10	¶“‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: On that day thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil plan.
21437	26	38	11	You will say, “I will invade a land of unwalled towns; I will advance against those living quietly in security – all of them living without walls and barred gates –
21438	26	38	12	to loot and plunder, to attack the inhabited ruins and the people gathered from the nations, who are acquiring cattle and goods, who live at the center of the earth.”
21439	26	38	13	Sheba and Dedan and the traders of Tarshish with all its young warriors will say to you, “Have you come to loot? Have you assembled your armies to plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to haul away a great amount of spoils?”’
21440	26	38	14	¶“Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: On that day when my people Israel are living securely, you will take notice
21441	26	38	15	and come from your place, from the remote parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a vast army.
21442	26	38	16	You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud covering the earth. In the latter days I will bring you against my land so that the nations may acknowledge me, when before their eyes I magnify myself through you, O Gog.
21443	26	38	17	¶“‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Are you the one of whom I spoke in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days that I would bring you against them?
21444	26	38	18	On that day, when Gog invades the land of Israel, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, my rage will mount up in my anger.
21445	26	38	19	In my zeal, in the fire of my fury, I declare that on that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
21446	26	38	20	The fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the wild beasts, all the things that creep on the ground, and all people who live on the face of the earth will shake at my presence. The mountains will topple, the cliffs will fall, and every wall will fall to the ground.
21447	26	38	21	I will call for a sword to attack Gog on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; every man’s sword will be against his brother.
21448	26	38	22	I will judge him with plague and bloodshed. I will rain down on him, his troops and the many peoples who are with him a torrential downpour, hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
21449	26	38	23	I will exalt and magnify myself; I will reveal myself before many nations. Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’
21450	26	39	1	¶“As for you, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Look, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal!
21451	26	39	2	I will turn you around and drag you along; I will lead you up from the remotest parts of the north and bring you against the mountains of Israel.
21452	26	39	3	I will knock your bow out of your left hand and make your arrows fall from your right hand.
21453	26	39	4	You will fall dead on the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the people who are with you. I give you as food to every kind of bird and every wild beast.
21454	26	39	5	You will fall dead in the open field; for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21455	26	39	6	I will send fire on Magog and those who live securely in the coastlands; then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21456	26	39	7	¶“‘I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; I will not let my holy name be profaned anymore. Then the nations will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the Holy One of Israel.
21457	26	39	8	Realize that it is coming and it will be done, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. It is the day I have spoken about.
21458	26	39	9	¶“‘Then those who live in the cities of Israel will go out and use the weapons for kindling – the shields, bows and arrows, war clubs and spears – they will burn them for seven years.
21459	26	39	10	They will not need to take wood from the field or cut down trees from the forests, because they will make fires with the weapons. They will take the loot from those who looted them and seize the plunder of those who plundered them, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21460	26	39	11	¶“‘On that day I will assign Gog a grave in Israel. It will be the valley of those who travel east of the sea; it will block the way of the travelers. There they will bury Gog and all his horde; they will call it the valley of Hamon-Gog.
21461	26	39	12	For seven months Israel will bury them, in order to cleanse the land.
21462	26	39	13	All the people of the land will bury them, and it will be a memorial for them on the day I magnify myself, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21463	26	39	14	They will designate men to scout continually through the land, burying those who remain on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. They will search for seven full months.
21464	26	39	15	When the scouts survey the land and see a human bone, they will place a sign by it, until those assigned to burial duty have buried it in the valley of Hamon-Gog.
21465	26	39	16	(A city by the name of Hamonah will also be there.) They will cleanse the land.’
21466	26	39	17	¶“As for you, son of man, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Tell every kind of bird and every wild beast: ‘Assemble and come! Gather from all around to my slaughter which I am going to make for you, a great slaughter on the mountains of Israel! You will eat flesh and drink blood.
21467	26	39	18	You will eat the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the princes of the earth – the rams, lambs, goats, and bulls, all of them fattened animals of Bashan.
21468	26	39	19	You will eat fat until you are full, and drink blood until you are drunk, at my slaughter which I have made for you.
21469	26	39	20	You will fill up at my table with horses and charioteers, with warriors and all the soldiers,’ declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21470	26	39	21	¶“I will display my majesty among the nations. All the nations will witness the judgment I have executed, and the power I have exhibited among them.
21471	26	39	22	Then the house of Israel will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God, from that day forward.
21472	26	39	23	The nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile due to their iniquity, for they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies; all of them died by the sword.
21473	26	39	24	According to their uncleanness and rebellion I have dealt with them, and I hid my face from them.
21474	26	39	25	¶“Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob, and I will have mercy on the entire house of Israel. I will be zealous for my holy name.
21475	26	39	26	They will bear their shame for all their unfaithful acts against me, when they live securely on their land with no one to make them afraid.
21476	26	39	27	When I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from the countries of their enemies, I will magnify myself among them in the sight of many nations.
21477	26	39	28	Then they will know that I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God, because I sent them into exile among the nations, and then gathered them into their own land. I will not leave any of them in exile any longer.
21478	26	39	29	I will no longer hide my face from them, when I pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
21479	26	40	1	¶In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on this very day, the hand of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was on me, and he brought me there.
21480	26	40	2	By means of divine visions he brought me to the land of Israel and placed me on a very high mountain, and on it was a structure like a city, to the south.
21481	26	40	3	When he brought me there, I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring stick in his hand. He was standing in the gateway.
21482	26	40	4	The man said to me, “Son of man, watch closely, listen carefully, and pay attention to everything I show you, for you have been brought here so that I can show it to you. Tell the house of Israel everything you see.”
21483	26	40	5	¶I saw a wall all around the outside of the temple. In the man’s hand was a measuring stick 10½ feet long. He measured the thickness of the wall as 10½ feet, and its height as 10½ feet.
21484	26	40	6	Then he went to the gate facing east. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate as 10½ feet deep.
21485	26	40	7	The alcoves were 10½ feet long and 10½ feet wide; between the alcoves were 8¾ feet. The threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate facing inward was 10½ feet.
21486	26	40	8	Then he measured the porch of the gate facing inward as 10½ feet.
21487	26	40	9	He measured the porch of the gate as 14 feet, and its jambs as 3½ feet; the porch of the gate faced inward.
21488	26	40	10	There were three alcoves on each side of the east gate; the three had the same measurement, and the jambs on either side had the same measurement.
21489	26	40	11	He measured the width of the entrance of the gateway as 17½ feet, and the length of the gateway as 22¾ feet.
21490	26	40	12	There was a barrier in front of the alcoves, 1¾ feet on either side; the alcoves were 10½ feet on either side.
21491	26	40	13	He measured the gateway from the roof of one alcove to the roof of the other, a width of 43¾ feet from one entrance to the opposite one.
21492	26	40	14	He measured the porch at 105 feet high; the gateway went all around to the jamb of the courtyard.
21493	26	40	15	From the front of the entrance gate to the porch of the inner gate was 87½ feet.
21494	26	40	16	There were closed windows toward the alcoves and toward their jambs within the gate all around, and likewise for the porches. There were windows all around the inside, and on each jamb were decorative palm trees.
21495	26	40	17	¶Then he brought me to the outer court. I saw chambers there, and a pavement made for the court all around; thirty chambers faced the pavement.
21496	26	40	18	The pavement was beside the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.
21497	26	40	19	Then he measured the width from before the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the inner court as 175 feet on the east and on the north.
21498	26	40	20	¶He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court which faces north.
21499	26	40	21	Its alcoves, three on each side, and its jambs and porches had the same measurement as the first gate; 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide.
21500	26	40	22	Its windows, its porches, and its decorative palm trees had the same measurement as the gate which faced east. Seven steps led up to it, and its porch was in front of them.
21501	26	40	23	Opposite the gate on the north and the east was a gate of the inner court; he measured the distance from gate to gate at 175 feet.
21502	26	40	24	¶Then he led me toward the south. I saw a gate on the south. He measured its jambs and its porches; they had the same dimensions as the others.
21503	26	40	25	There were windows all around it and its porches, like the windows of the others; 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide.
21504	26	40	26	There were seven steps going up to it; its porches were in front of them. It had decorative palm trees on its jambs, one on either side.
21505	26	40	27	The inner court had a gate toward the south; he measured it from gate to gate toward the south as 175 feet.
21506	26	40	28	¶Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. He measured the south gate; it had the same dimensions as the others.
21507	26	40	29	Its alcoves, its jambs, and its porches had the same dimensions as the others, and there were windows all around it and its porches; its length was 87½ feet and its width 43¾ feet.
21508	26	40	30	There were porches all around, 43¾ feet long and 8¾ feet wide.
21509	26	40	31	Its porches faced the outer court, and decorative palm trees were on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps.
21510	26	40	32	¶Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side. He measured the gate; it had the same dimensions as the others.
21511	26	40	33	Its alcoves, its jambs, and its porches had the same dimensions as the others, and there were windows all around it and its porches; its length was 87½ feet and its width 43¾ feet.
21512	26	40	34	Its porches faced the outer court, it had decorative palm trees on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps.
21513	26	40	35	¶Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it; it had the same dimensions as the others –
21514	26	40	36	its alcoves, its jambs, and its porches. It had windows all around it; its length was 87½ feet and its width 43¾ feet.
21515	26	40	37	Its jambs faced the outer court, and it had decorative palm trees on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps.
21516	26	40	38	¶There was a chamber with its door by the porch of the gate; there they washed the burnt offering.
21517	26	40	39	In the porch of the gate were two tables on either side on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering.
21518	26	40	40	On the outside of the porch as one goes up at the entrance of the north gate were two tables, and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables.
21519	26	40	41	Four tables were on each side of the gate, eight tables on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered.
21520	26	40	42	The four tables for the burnt offering were of carved stone, 32 inches long, 32 inches wide, and 21 inches high. They would put the instruments which they used to slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice on them.
21521	26	40	43	There were hooks three inches long, fastened in the house all around, and on the tables was the flesh of the offering.
21522	26	40	44	¶On the outside of the inner gate were chambers for the singers of the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, and the other at the side of the south gate facing north.
21523	26	40	45	He said to me, “This chamber which faces south is for the priests who keep charge of the temple,
21524	26	40	46	and the chamber which faces north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the descendants of Zadok, from the descendants of Levi, who may approach the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to minister to him.”
21525	26	40	47	He measured the court as a square 175 feet long and 175 feet wide; the altar was in front of the temple.
21526	26	40	48	¶Then he brought me to the porch of the temple and measured the jambs of the porch as 8¾ feet on either side, and the width of the gate was 24½ feet and the sides were 5¼ feet on each side.
21527	26	40	49	The length of the porch was 35 feet and the width 19¼ feet; steps led up to it, and there were pillars beside the jambs on either side.
21528	26	41	1	¶Then he brought me to the outer sanctuary, and measured the jambs; the jambs were 10½ feet wide on each side.
21529	26	41	2	The width of the entrance was 17½ feet, and the sides of the entrance were 8¾ feet on each side. He measured the length of the outer sanctuary as 70 feet, and its width as 35 feet.
21530	26	41	3	¶Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance as 3½ feet, the entrance as 10½ feet, and the width of the entrance as 12¼ feet.
21531	26	41	4	Then he measured its length as 35 feet, and its width as 35 feet, before the outer sanctuary. He said to me, “This is the most holy place.”
21532	26	41	5	¶Then he measured the wall of the temple as 10½ feet, and the width of the side chambers as 7 feet, all around the temple.
21533	26	41	6	The side chambers were in three stories, one above the other, thirty in each story. There were offsets in the wall all around to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that the supports were not in the wall of the temple.
21534	26	41	7	The side chambers surrounding the temple were wider at each successive story; for the structure surrounding the temple went up story by story all around the temple. For this reason the width of the temple increased as it went up, and one went up from the lowest story to the highest by the way of the middle story.
21535	26	41	8	¶I saw that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full measuring stick of 10½ feet high.
21536	26	41	9	The width of the outer wall of the side chambers was 8¾ feet, and the open area between the side chambers of the temple
21537	26	41	10	and the chambers of the court was 35 feet in width all around the temple on every side.
21538	26	41	11	There were entrances from the side chambers toward the open area, one entrance toward the north, and another entrance toward the south; the width of the open area was 8¾ feet all around.
21539	26	41	12	¶The building that was facing the temple courtyard at the west side was 122½ feet wide; the wall of the building was 8¾ feet thick all around, and its length 157½ feet.
21540	26	41	13	¶Then he measured the temple as 175 feet long, the courtyard of the temple and the building and its walls as 175 feet long,
21541	26	41	14	and also the width of the front of the temple and the courtyard on the east as 175 feet.
21542	26	41	15	¶Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, with its galleries on either side as 175 feet. ¶The interior of the outer sanctuary and the porch of the court,
21543	26	41	16	as well as the thresholds, narrow windows and galleries all around on three sides facing the threshold were paneled with wood all around, from the ground up to the windows (now the windows were covered),
21544	26	41	17	to the space above the entrance, to the inner room, and on the outside, and on all the walls in the inner room and outside, by measurement.
21545	26	41	18	It was made with cherubim and decorative palm trees, with a palm tree between each cherub. Each cherub had two faces:
21546	26	41	19	a human face toward the palm tree on one side and a lion’s face toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple all around;
21547	26	41	20	from the ground to the area above the entrance, cherubim and decorative palm trees were carved on the wall of the outer sanctuary.
21548	26	41	21	The doorposts of the outer sanctuary were square. In front of the sanctuary one doorpost looked just like the other.
21549	26	41	22	The altar was of wood, 5¼ feet high, with its length 3½ feet; its corners, its length, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, “This is the table that is before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
21550	26	41	23	The outer sanctuary and the inner sanctuary each had a double door.
21551	26	41	24	Each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging leaves; two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other.
21552	26	41	25	On the doors of the outer sanctuary were carved cherubim and palm trees, like those carved on the walls, and there was a canopy of wood on the front of the outside porch.
21553	26	41	26	There were narrow windows and decorative palm trees on either side of the side walls of the porch; this is what the side chambers of the temple and the canopies were like.
21554	26	42	1	¶Then he led me out to the outer court, toward the north, and brought me to the chamber which was opposite the courtyard and opposite the building on the north.
21555	26	42	2	Its length was 175 feet on the north side, and its width 87½ feet.
21556	26	42	3	Opposite the 35 feet that belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, gallery faced gallery in the three stories.
21557	26	42	4	In front of the chambers was a walkway on the inner side, 17½ feet wide at a distance of 1¾ feet, and their entrances were on the north.
21558	26	42	5	Now the upper chambers were narrower, because the galleries took more space from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building.
21559	26	42	6	For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and middle ones.
21560	26	42	7	As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court facing the chambers, it was 87½ feet long.
21561	26	42	8	For the chambers on the outer court were 87½ feet long, while those facing the temple were 175 feet long.
21562	26	42	9	Below these chambers was a passage on the east side as one enters from the outer court.
21563	26	42	10	¶At the beginning of the wall of the court toward the south, facing the courtyard and the building, were chambers
21564	26	42	11	with a passage in front of them. They looked like the chambers on the north. Of the same length and width, and all their exits according to their arrangements and entrances
21565	26	42	12	were the chambers which were toward the south. There was an opening at the head of the passage, the passage in front of the corresponding wall toward the east when one enters.
21566	26	42	13	¶Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers which face the courtyard are holy chambers where the priests who approach the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will eat the most holy offerings. There they will place the most holy offerings – the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, because the place is holy.
21567	26	42	14	When the priests enter, then they will not go out from the sanctuary to the outer court without taking off their garments in which they minister, for these are holy; they will put on other garments, then they will go near the places where the people are.”
21568	26	42	15	¶Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple, he led me out by the gate which faces east and measured all around.
21569	26	42	16	He measured the east side with the measuring stick as 875 feet by the measuring stick.
21570	26	42	17	He measured the north side as 875 feet by the measuring stick.
21571	26	42	18	He measured the south side as 875 feet by the measuring stick.
21572	26	42	19	He turned to the west side and measured 875 feet by the measuring stick.
21573	26	42	20	He measured it on all four sides. It had a wall around it, 875 feet long and 875 feet wide, to separate the holy and common places.
21574	26	43	1	¶Then he brought me to the gate that faced toward the east.
21575	26	43	2	I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east; the sound was like that of rushing water; and the earth radiated his glory.
21576	26	43	3	It was like the vision I saw when he came to destroy the city, and the vision I saw by the Kebar River. I threw myself face down.
21577	26	43	4	The glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> came into the temple by way of the gate that faces east.
21578	26	43	5	Then a wind lifted me up and brought me to the inner court; I watched the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> filling the temple.
21579	26	43	6	¶I heard someone speaking to me from the temple, while the man was standing beside me.
21580	26	43	7	He said to me: “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will live among the people of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no longer profane my holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their spiritual prostitution or by the pillars of their kings set up when they die.
21581	26	43	8	When they placed their threshold by my threshold and their doorpost by my doorpost, with only the wall between me and them, they profaned my holy name by the abominable deeds they committed. So I consumed them in my anger.
21582	26	43	9	Now they must put away their spiritual prostitution and the pillars of their kings far from me, and then I will live among them forever.
21583	26	43	10	¶“As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, so that they will be ashamed of their sins and measure the pattern.
21584	26	43	11	When they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple, its pattern, its exits and entrances, and its whole design – all its statutes, its entire design, and all its laws; write it all down in their sight, so that they may observe its entire design and all its statutes and do them.
21585	26	43	12	¶“This is the law of the temple: The entire area on top of the mountain all around will be most holy. Indeed, this is the law of the temple.
21586	26	43	13	¶“And these are the measurements of the altar: Its base is 1¾ feet high, and 1¾ feet wide, and its border nine inches on its edge. This is to be the height of the altar.
21587	26	43	14	From the base of the ground to the lower ledge is 3½ feet, and the width 1¾ feet; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, 7 feet, and the width 1¾ feet;
21588	26	43	15	and the altar hearth, 7 feet, and from the altar hearth four horns projecting upward.
21589	26	43	16	Now the altar hearth is a perfect square, 21 feet long and 21 feet wide.
21590	26	43	17	The ledge is 24½ feet long and 24½ feet wide on four sides; the border around it is 10½ inches, and its surrounding base 1¾ feet. Its steps face east.”
21591	26	43	18	¶Then he said to me: “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: These are the statutes of the altar: On the day it is built to offer up burnt offerings on it and to sprinkle blood on it,
21592	26	43	19	you will give a young bull for a sin offering to the Levitical priests who are descended from Zadok, who approach me to minister to me, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21593	26	43	20	You will take some of its blood, and place it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around; you will purify it and make atonement for it.
21594	26	43	21	You will also take the bull for the sin offering, and it will be burned in the appointed place in the temple, outside the sanctuary.
21595	26	43	22	¶“On the second day, you will offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering. They will purify the altar just as they purified it with the bull.
21596	26	43	23	When you have finished purifying it, you will offer an unblemished young bull and an unblemished ram from the flock.
21597	26	43	24	You will present them before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, and the priests will scatter salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21598	26	43	25	¶“For seven days you will provide every day a goat for a sin offering; a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without blemish, will be provided.
21599	26	43	26	For seven days they will make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, so they will consecrate it.
21600	26	43	27	When the prescribed period is over, on the eighth day and thereafter the priests will offer up on the altar your burnt offerings and your peace offerings; I will accept you, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
21601	26	44	1	¶Then he brought me back by way of the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces east, but it was shut.
21602	26	44	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me: “This gate will be shut; it will not be opened, and no one will enter by it. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, has entered by it; therefore it will remain shut.
21603	26	44	3	Only the prince may sit in it to eat a sacrificial meal before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; he will enter by way of the porch of the gate and will go out by the same way.”
21604	26	44	4	¶Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. As I watched, I noticed the glory of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> filling the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s temple, and I threw myself face down.
21605	26	44	5	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me: “Son of man, pay attention, watch closely and listen carefully to everything I tell you concerning all the statutes of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s house and all its laws. Pay attention to the entrances to the temple with all the exits of the sanctuary.
21606	26	44	6	Say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Enough of all your abominable practices, O house of Israel!
21607	26	44	7	When you bring foreigners, those uncircumcised in heart and in flesh, into my sanctuary, you desecrate it – even my house – when you offer my food, the fat and the blood. You have broken my covenant by all your abominable practices.
21608	26	44	8	You have not kept charge of my holy things, but you have assigned foreigners to keep charge of my sanctuary for you.
21609	26	44	9	This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: No foreigner, who is uncircumcised in heart and flesh among all the foreigners who are among the people of Israel, will enter into my sanctuary.
21610	26	44	10	¶“‘But the Levites who went far from me, straying off from me after their idols when Israel went astray, will be responsible for their sin.
21611	26	44	11	Yet they will be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the temple, and serving the temple. They will slaughter the burnt offerings and the sacrifices for the people, and they will stand before them to minister to them.
21612	26	44	12	Because they used to minister to them before their idols, and became a sinful obstacle to the house of Israel, consequently I have made a vow concerning them, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, that they will be responsible for their sin.
21613	26	44	13	They will not come near me to serve me as priest, nor will they come near any of my holy things, the things which are most sacred. They will bear the shame of the abominable deeds they have committed.
21614	26	44	14	Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the temple, all of its service and all that will be done in it.
21615	26	44	15	¶“‘But the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the people of Israel went astray from me, will approach me to minister to me; they will stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21616	26	44	16	They will enter my sanctuary, and approach my table to minister to me; they will keep my charge.
21617	26	44	17	¶“‘When they enter the gates of the inner court, they must wear linen garments; they must not have any wool on them when they minister in the inner gates of the court and in the temple.
21618	26	44	18	Linen turbans will be on their heads and linen undergarments will be around their waists; they must not bind themselves with anything that causes sweat.
21619	26	44	19	When they go out to the outer court to the people, they must remove the garments they were ministering in, and place them in the holy chambers; they must put on other garments so that they will not transmit holiness to the people with their garments.
21620	26	44	20	¶“‘They must not shave their heads nor let their hair grow long; they must only trim their heads.
21621	26	44	21	No priest may drink wine when he enters the inner court.
21622	26	44	22	They must not marry a widow or a divorcee, but they may marry a virgin from the house of Israel or a widow who is a priest’s widow.
21623	26	44	23	Moreover, they will teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to distinguish between the ceremonially unclean and the clean.
21624	26	44	24	¶“‘In a controversy they will act as judges; they will judge according to my ordinances. They will keep my laws and my statutes regarding all my appointed festivals and will observe my Sabbaths.
21625	26	44	25	¶“‘They must not come near a dead person or they will be defiled; however, for father, mother, son, daughter, brother or unmarried sister, they may defile themselves.
21626	26	44	26	After a priest has become ceremonially clean, they must count off a period of seven days for him.
21627	26	44	27	On the day he enters the sanctuary, into the inner court to serve in the sanctuary, he must offer his sin offering, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21628	26	44	28	¶“‘This will be their inheritance: I am their inheritance, and you must give them no property in Israel; I am their property.
21629	26	44	29	They may eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, and every devoted thing in Israel will be theirs.
21630	26	44	30	The first of all the first fruits and all contributions of any kind will be for the priests; you will also give to the priest the first portion of your dough, so that a blessing may rest on your house.
21631	26	44	31	The priests will not eat any bird or animal that has died a natural death or was torn to pieces by a wild animal.
21632	26	45	1	¶“‘When you allot the land as an inheritance, you will offer an allotment to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, a holy portion from the land; the length will be eight and a quarter miles and the width three and one-third miles. This entire area will be holy.
21633	26	45	2	Of this area a square 875 feet by 875 feet will be designated for the sanctuary, with 87½ feet set aside for its open space round about.
21634	26	45	3	From this measured area you will measure a length of eight and a quarter miles and a width of three and one-third miles; in it will be the sanctuary, the most holy place.
21635	26	45	4	It will be a holy portion of the land; it will be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary who approach the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> to minister to him. It will be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.
21636	26	45	5	An area eight and a quarter miles in length and three and one-third miles in width will be for the Levites, who minister at the temple, as the place for the cities in which they will live.
21637	26	45	6	¶“‘Alongside the portion set apart as the holy allotment, you will allot for the city an area one and two-thirds miles wide and eight and a quarter miles long; it will be for the whole house of Israel.
21638	26	45	7	¶“‘For the prince there will be land on both sides of the holy allotment and the allotted city, alongside the holy allotment and the allotted city, on the west side and on the east side; it will be comparable in length to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border
21639	26	45	8	of the land. This will be his property in Israel. My princes will no longer oppress my people, but the land will be allotted to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
21640	26	45	9	¶“‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: Enough, you princes of Israel! Put away violence and destruction, and do what is just and right. Put an end to your evictions of my people, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21641	26	45	10	You must use just balances, a just dry measure (an ephah), and a just liquid measure (a bath).
21642	26	45	11	The dry and liquid measures will be the same, the bath will contain a tenth of a homer, and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer will be the standard measure.
21643	26	45	12	The shekel will be twenty gerahs. Sixty shekels will be a mina for you.
21644	26	45	13	¶“‘This is the offering you must offer: a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat; a sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley,
21645	26	45	14	and as the prescribed portion of olive oil, one tenth of a bath from each cor (which is ten baths or a homer, for ten baths make a homer);
21646	26	45	15	and one sheep from each flock of two hundred, from the watered places of Israel, for a grain offering, burnt offering, and peace offering, to make atonement for them, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21647	26	45	16	All the people of the land will contribute to this offering for the prince of Israel.
21648	26	45	17	It will be the duty of the prince to provide the burnt offerings, the grain offering, and the drink offering at festivals, on the new moons and Sabbaths, at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel; he will provide the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.
21649	26	45	18	¶“‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you must take an unblemished young bull and purify the sanctuary.
21650	26	45	19	The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering and place it on the doorpost of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the doorpost of the gate of the inner court.
21651	26	45	20	This is what you must do on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins inadvertently or through ignorance; so you will make atonement for the temple.
21652	26	45	21	¶“‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you will celebrate the Passover, and for the seven days of the festival bread made without yeast will be eaten.
21653	26	45	22	On that day the prince will provide for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.
21654	26	45	23	And during the seven days of the feast he will provide as a burnt offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> seven bulls and seven rams, all without blemish, on each of the seven days, and a male goat daily for a sin offering.
21655	26	45	24	He will provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull, an ephah for each ram, and a gallon of olive oil for each ephah of grain.
21656	26	45	25	In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he will make the same provisions for the sin offering, burnt offering, and grain offering, and for the olive oil, for the seven days.
21657	26	46	1	¶“‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: The gate of the inner court that faces east will be closed six working days, but on the Sabbath day it will be opened and on the day of the new moon it will be opened.
21658	26	46	2	The prince will enter by way of the porch of the gate from the outside, and will stand by the doorpost of the gate. The priests will provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he will bow down at the threshold of the gate and then go out. But the gate will not be closed until evening.
21659	26	46	3	The people of the land will bow down at the entrance of that gate before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.
21660	26	46	4	The burnt offering which the prince will offer to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on the Sabbath day will be six unblemished lambs and one unblemished ram.
21661	26	46	5	The grain offering will be an ephah with the ram, and the grain offering with the lambs will be as much as he is able to give, and a gallon of olive oil with an ephah.
21662	26	46	6	On the day of the new moon he will offer an unblemished young bull, and six lambs and a ram, all without blemish.
21663	26	46	7	He will provide a grain offering: an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wishes, and a gallon of olive oil with each ephah of grain.
21664	26	46	8	When the prince enters, he will come by way of the porch of the gate and will go out the same way.
21665	26	46	9	¶“‘When the people of the land come before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> at the appointed feasts, whoever enters by way of the north gate to worship will go out by way of the south gate; whoever enters by way of the south gate will go out by way of the north gate. No one will return by way of the gate they entered but will go out straight ahead.
21666	26	46	10	When they come in, the prince will come in with them, and when they go out, he will go out.
21667	26	46	11	¶“‘At the festivals and at the appointed feasts the grain offering will be an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as one is able, and a gallon of olive oil with each ephah of grain.
21668	26	46	12	When the prince provides a freewill offering, a burnt offering, or peace offerings as a voluntary offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the gate facing east will be opened for him, and he will provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings just as he did on the Sabbath. Then he will go out, and the gate will be closed after he goes out.
21669	26	46	13	¶“‘You will provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering daily to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; morning by morning he will provide it.
21670	26	46	14	And you will provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah, and a third of a gallon of olive oil to moisten the choice flour, as a grain offering to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>; this is a perpetual statute.
21671	26	46	15	Thus they will provide the lamb, the grain offering, and the olive oil morning by morning, as a perpetual burnt offering.
21672	26	46	16	¶“‘This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: If the prince should give a gift to one of his sons as his inheritance, it will belong to his sons, it is their property by inheritance.
21673	26	46	17	But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will be his until the year of liberty; then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance will only remain with his sons.
21674	26	46	18	The prince will not take away any of the people’s inheritance by oppressively removing them from their property. He will give his sons an inheritance from his own possessions so that my people will not be scattered, each from his own property.’”
21675	26	46	19	¶Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests which faced north. There I saw a place at the extreme western end.
21676	26	46	20	He said to me, “This is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they will bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out to the outer court to transmit holiness to the people.”
21677	26	46	21	¶Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me past the four corners of the court, and I noticed that in every corner of the court there was a court.
21678	26	46	22	In the four corners of the court were small courts, 70 feet in length and 52½ feet in width; the four were all the same size.
21679	26	46	23	There was a row of masonry around each of the four courts, and places for boiling offerings were made under the rows all around.
21680	26	46	24	Then he said to me, “These are the houses for boiling, where the ministers of the temple boil the sacrifices of the people.”
21681	26	47	1	¶Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple. I noticed that water was flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from under the right side of the temple, from south of the altar.
21682	26	47	2	He led me out by way of the north gate and brought me around the outside of the outer gate that faces toward the east; I noticed that the water was trickling out from the south side.
21683	26	47	3	¶When the man went out toward the east with a measuring line in his hand, he measured 1,750 feet, and then he led me through water, which was ankle deep.
21684	26	47	4	Again he measured 1,750 feet and led me through the water, which was now knee deep. Once more he measured 1,750 feet and led me through the water, which was waist deep.
21685	26	47	5	Again he measured 1,750 feet and it was a river I could not cross, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed.
21686	26	47	6	He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” ¶Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
21687	26	47	7	When I had returned, I noticed a vast number of trees on the banks of the river, on both sides.
21688	26	47	8	He said to me, “These waters go out toward the eastern region and flow down into the rift valley; when they enter the Dead Sea, where the sea is stagnant, the waters become fresh.
21689	26	47	9	Every living creature which swarms where the river flows will live; there will be many fish, for these waters flow there. It will become fresh and everything will live where the river flows.
21690	26	47	10	Fishermen will stand beside it; from En Gedi to En Eglaim they will spread nets. They will catch many kinds of fish, like the fish of the Great Sea.
21691	26	47	11	But its swamps and its marshes will not become fresh; they will remain salty.
21692	26	47	12	On both sides of the river’s banks, every kind of tree will grow for food. Their leaves will not wither nor will their fruit fail, but they will bear fruit every month, because their water source flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing.”
21693	26	47	13	¶This is what the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: “Here are the borders you will observe as you allot the land to the twelve tribes of Israel. (Joseph will have two portions.)
21694	26	47	14	You must divide it equally just as I vowed to give it to your forefathers; this land will be assigned as your inheritance.
21695	26	47	15	¶“This will be the border of the land: On the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to the entrance of Zedad;
21696	26	47	16	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, as far as Hazer-hattikon, which is on the border of Hauran.
21697	26	47	17	The border will run from the sea to Hazar-enan, at the border of Damascus, and on the north is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.
21698	26	47	18	On the east side, between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, will be the Jordan. You will measure from the border to the eastern sea. This is the east side.
21699	26	47	19	On the south side it will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh, the river, to the Great Sea. This is the south side.
21700	26	47	20	On the west side the Great Sea will be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo Hamath. This is the west side.
21701	26	47	21	¶“This is how you will divide this land for yourselves among the tribes of Israel.
21702	26	47	22	You must allot it as an inheritance among yourselves and for the resident foreigners who live among you, who have fathered sons among you. You must treat them as native-born among the people of Israel; they will be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
21703	26	47	23	In whatever tribe the resident foreigner lives, there you will give him his inheritance,” declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21704	26	48	1	¶“These are the names of the tribes: From the northern end beside the road of Hethlon to Lebo Hamath, as far as Hazar-enan (which is on the border of Damascus, toward the north beside Hamath), extending from the east side to the west, Dan will have one portion.
21705	26	48	2	Next to the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher will have one portion.
21706	26	48	3	Next to the border of Asher from the east side to the west side, Naphtali will have one portion.
21707	26	48	4	Next to the border of Naphtali from the east side to the west side, Manasseh will have one portion.
21708	26	48	5	Next to the border of Manasseh from the east side to the west side, Ephraim will have one portion.
21709	26	48	6	Next to the border of Ephraim from the east side to the west side, Reuben will have one portion.
21710	26	48	7	Next to the border of Reuben from the east side to the west side, Judah will have one portion.
21711	26	48	8	¶“Next to the border of Judah from the east side to the west side will be the allotment you must set apart. It is to be eight and a quarter miles wide, and the same length as one of the tribal portions, from the east side to the west side; the sanctuary will be in the middle of it.
21712	26	48	9	The allotment you set apart to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be eight and a quarter miles in length and three and one-third miles in width.
21713	26	48	10	These will be the allotments for the holy portion: for the priests, toward the north eight and a quarter miles in length, toward the west three and one-third miles in width, toward the east three and one-third miles in width, and toward the south eight and a quarter miles in length; the sanctuary of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be in the middle.
21714	26	48	11	This will be for the priests who are set apart from the descendants of Zadok who kept my charge and did not go astray when the people of Israel strayed off, like the Levites did.
21715	26	48	12	It will be their portion from the allotment of the land, a most holy place, next to the border of the Levites.
21716	26	48	13	¶“Alongside the border of the priests, the Levites will have an allotment eight and a quarter miles in length and three and one-third miles in width. The whole length will be eight and a quarter miles and the width three and one-third miles.
21717	26	48	14	They must not sell or exchange any of it; they must not transfer this choice portion of land, for it is set apart to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21718	26	48	15	¶“The remainder, one and two-thirds miles in width and eight and a quarter miles in length, will be for common use by the city, for houses and for open space. The city will be in the middle of it;
21719	26	48	16	these will be its measurements: The north side will be one and one-half miles, the south side one and one-half miles, the east side one and one-half miles, and the west side one and one-half miles.
21720	26	48	17	The city will have open spaces: On the north there will be 437½ feet, on the south 437½ feet, on the east 437½ feet, and on the west 437½ feet.
21721	26	48	18	The remainder of the length alongside the holy allotment will be three and one-third miles to the east and three and one-third miles toward the west, and it will be beside the holy allotment. Its produce will be for food for the workers of the city.
21722	26	48	19	The workers of the city from all the tribes of Israel will cultivate it.
21723	26	48	20	The whole allotment will be eight and a quarter miles square, you must set apart the holy allotment with the possession of the city.
21724	26	48	21	¶“The rest, on both sides of the holy allotment and the property of the city, will belong to the prince. Extending from the eight and a quarter miles of the holy allotment to the east border, and westward from the eight and a quarter miles to the west border, alongside the portions, it will belong to the prince. The holy allotment and the sanctuary of the temple will be in the middle of it.
21725	26	48	22	The property of the Levites and of the city will be in the middle of that which belongs to the prince. The portion between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin will be for the prince.
21726	26	48	23	¶“As for the rest of the tribes: From the east side to the west side, Benjamin will have one portion.
21727	26	48	24	Next to the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon will have one portion.
21728	26	48	25	Next to the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar will have one portion.
21729	26	48	26	Next to the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun will have one portion.
21730	26	48	27	Next to the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad will have one portion.
21731	26	48	28	Next to the border of Gad, at the south side, the border will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh, to the Stream of Egypt and on to the Great Sea.
21732	26	48	29	This is the land which you will allot to the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, declares the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
21733	26	48	30	¶“These are the exits of the city: On the north side, one and one-half miles by measure,
21734	26	48	31	the gates of the city will be named for the tribes of Israel; there will be three gates to the north: one gate for Reuben, one gate for Judah, and one gate for Levi.
21735	26	48	32	On the east side, one and one-half miles in length, there will be three gates: one gate for Joseph, one gate for Benjamin, and one gate for Dan.
21736	26	48	33	On the south side, one and one-half miles by measure, there will be three gates: one gate for Simeon, one gate for Issachar, and one gate for Zebulun.
21737	26	48	34	On the west side, one and one-half miles in length, there will be three gates: one gate for Gad, one gate for Asher, and one gate for Naphtali.
21738	26	48	35	The circumference of the city will be six miles. The name of the city from that day forward will be: ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> Is There.’”
21739	27	1	1	¶In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem and laid it under siege.
21740	27	1	2	Now the Lord delivered King Jehoiakim of Judah into his power, along with some of the vessels of the temple of God. He brought them to the land of Babylonia to the temple of his god and put the vessels in the treasury of his god.
21741	27	1	3	¶The king commanded Ashpenaz, who was in charge of his court officials, to choose some of the Israelites who were of royal and noble descent –
21742	27	1	4	young men in whom there was no physical defect and who were handsome, well versed in all kinds of wisdom, well educated and having keen insight, and who were capable of entering the king’s royal service – and to teach them the literature and language of the Babylonians.
21743	27	1	5	So the king assigned them a daily ration from his royal delicacies and from the wine he himself drank. They were to be trained for the next three years. At the end of that time they were to enter the king’s service.
21744	27	1	6	As it turned out, among these young men were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
21745	27	1	7	But the overseer of the court officials renamed them. He gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar, Hananiah he named Shadrach, Mishael he named Meshach, and Azariah he named Abednego.
21746	27	1	8	¶But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the royal delicacies or the royal wine. He therefore asked the overseer of the court officials for permission not to defile himself.
21747	27	1	9	Then God made the overseer of the court officials sympathetic to Daniel.
21748	27	1	10	But he responded to Daniel, “I fear my master the king. He is the one who has decided your food and drink. What would happen if he saw that you looked malnourished in comparison to the other young men your age? If that happened, you would endanger my life with the king!”
21749	27	1	11	Daniel then spoke to the warden whom the overseer of the court officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
21750	27	1	12	“Please test your servants for ten days by providing us with some vegetables to eat and water to drink.
21751	27	1	13	Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who are eating the royal delicacies; deal with us in light of what you see.”
21752	27	1	14	So the warden agreed to their proposal and tested them for ten days.
21753	27	1	15	¶At the end of the ten days their appearance was better and their bodies were healthier than all the young men who had been eating the royal delicacies.
21754	27	1	16	So the warden removed the delicacies and the wine from their diet and gave them a diet of vegetables instead.
21755	27	1	17	Now as for these four young men, God endowed them with knowledge and skill in all sorts of literature and wisdom – and Daniel had insight into all kinds of visions and dreams.
21756	27	1	18	¶When the time appointed by the king arrived, the overseer of the court officials brought them into Nebuchadnezzar’s presence.
21757	27	1	19	When the king spoke with them, he did not find among the entire group anyone like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, or Azariah. So they entered the king’s service.
21758	27	1	20	In every matter of wisdom and insight the king asked them about, he found them to be ten times better than any of the magicians and astrologers that were in his entire empire.
21759	27	1	21	Now Daniel lived on until the first year of Cyrus the king.
21760	27	2	1	¶In the second year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar had many dreams. His mind was disturbed and he suffered from insomnia.
21761	27	2	2	The king issued an order to summon the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and wise men in order to explain his dreams to him. So they came and awaited the king’s instructions.
21762	27	2	3	¶The king told them, “I have had a dream, and I am anxious to understand the dream.”
21763	27	2	4	The wise men replied to the king: [What follows is in Aramaic] “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will disclose its interpretation.”
21764	27	2	5	The king replied to the wise men, “My decision is firm. If you do not inform me of both the dream and its interpretation, you will be dismembered and your homes reduced to rubble!
21765	27	2	6	But if you can disclose the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts, a reward, and considerable honor. So disclose to me the dream and its interpretation!”
21766	27	2	7	They again replied, “Let the king inform us of the dream; then we will disclose its interpretation.”
21767	27	2	8	The king replied, “I know for sure that you are attempting to gain time, because you see that my decision is firm.
21768	27	2	9	If you don’t inform me of the dream, there is only one thing that is going to happen to you. For you have agreed among yourselves to report to me something false and deceitful until such time as things might change. So tell me the dream, and I will have confidence that you can disclose its interpretation.”
21769	27	2	10	¶The wise men replied to the king, “There is no man on earth who is able to disclose the king’s secret, for no king, regardless of his position and power, has ever requested such a thing from any magician, astrologer, or wise man.
21770	27	2	11	What the king is asking is too difficult, and no one exists who can disclose it to the king, except for the gods – but they don’t live among mortals!”
21771	27	2	12	¶Because of this the king got furiously angry and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
21772	27	2	13	So a decree went out, and the wise men were about to be executed. They also sought Daniel and his friends so that they could be executed.
21773	27	2	14	¶Then Daniel spoke with prudent counsel to Arioch, who was in charge of the king’s executioners and who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.
21774	27	2	15	He inquired of Arioch the king’s deputy, “Why is the decree from the king so urgent?” Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter.
21775	27	2	16	So Daniel went in and requested the king to grant him time, that he might disclose the interpretation to the king.
21776	27	2	17	Then Daniel went to his home and informed his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the matter.
21777	27	2	18	He asked them to pray for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery so that he and his friends would not be destroyed along with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
21778	27	2	19	Then in a night vision the mystery was revealed to Daniel. So Daniel praised the God of heaven,
21779	27	2	20	saying, ‡“Let the name of God be praised forever and ever,‡for wisdom and power belong to him.
21780	27	2	21	‡He changes times and seasons,‡deposing some kings ‡and establishing others. ‡He gives wisdom to the wise;‡he imparts knowledge to those with understanding;
21781	27	2	22	‡he reveals deep and hidden things.‡He knows what is in the darkness,‡and light resides with him.
21782	27	2	23	‡O God of my fathers, I acknowledge and glorify you,‡for you have bestowed wisdom and power on me.‡Now you have enabled me to understand what I requested from you.‡For you have enabled me to understand the king’s dilemma.”
21783	27	2	24	¶Then Daniel went in to see Arioch (whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon). He came and said to him, “Don’t destroy the wise men of Babylon! Escort me to the king, and I will disclose the interpretation to him!”
21784	27	2	25	¶So Arioch quickly ushered Daniel into the king’s presence, saying to him, “I have found a man from the captives of Judah who can make known the interpretation to the king.”
21785	27	2	26	The king then asked Daniel (whose name was also Belteshazzar), “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I saw, as well as its interpretation?”
21786	27	2	27	Daniel replied to the king, “The mystery that the king is asking about is such that no wise men, astrologers, magicians, or diviners can possibly disclose it to the king.
21787	27	2	28	However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the times to come. The dream and the visions you had while lying on your bed are as follows.
21788	27	2	29	¶“As for you, O king, while you were in your bed your thoughts turned to future things. The revealer of mysteries has made known to you what will take place.
21789	27	2	30	As for me, this mystery was revealed to me not because I possess more wisdom than any other living person, but so that the king may understand the interpretation and comprehend the thoughts of your mind.
21790	27	2	31	¶“You, O king, were watching as a great statue – one of impressive size and extraordinary brightness – was standing before you. Its appearance caused alarm.
21791	27	2	32	As for that statue, its head was of fine gold, its chest and arms were of silver, its belly and thighs were of bronze.
21792	27	2	33	Its legs were of iron; its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay.
21793	27	2	34	You were watching as a stone was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its iron and clay feet, breaking them in pieces.
21794	27	2	35	Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were broken in pieces without distinction and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors that the wind carries away. Not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a large mountain that filled the entire earth.
21795	27	2	36	This was the dream. Now we will set forth before the king its interpretation.
21796	27	2	37	¶“You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has granted you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor.
21797	27	2	38	Wherever human beings, wild animals, and birds of the sky live – he has given them into your power. He has given you authority over them all. You are the head of gold.
21798	27	2	39	Now after you another kingdom will arise, one inferior to yours. Then a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule in all the earth.
21799	27	2	40	Then there will be a fourth kingdom, one strong like iron. Just like iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything, and as iron breaks in pieces all of these metals, so it will break in pieces and crush the others.
21800	27	2	41	In that you were seeing feet and toes partly of wet clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom. Some of the strength of iron will be in it, for you saw iron mixed with wet clay.
21801	27	2	42	In that the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, the latter stages of this kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.
21802	27	2	43	And in that you saw iron mixed with wet clay, so people will be mixed with one another without adhering to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay.
21803	27	2	44	In the days of those kings the God of heaven will raise up an everlasting kingdom that will not be destroyed and a kingdom that will not be left to another people. It will break in pieces and bring about the demise of all these kingdoms. But it will stand forever.
21804	27	2	45	You saw that a stone was cut from a mountain, but not by human hands; it smashed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold into pieces. The great God has made known to the king what will occur in the future. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is reliable.”
21805	27	2	46	¶Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed down with his face to the ground and paid homage to Daniel. He gave orders to offer sacrifice and incense to him.
21806	27	2	47	The king replied to Daniel, “Certainly your God is a God of gods and Lord of kings and revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery!”
21807	27	2	48	Then the king elevated Daniel to high position and bestowed on him many marvelous gifts. He granted him authority over the entire province of Babylon and made him the main prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
21808	27	2	49	And at Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the administration of the province of Babylon. Daniel himself served in the king’s court.
21809	27	3	1	¶King Nebuchadnezzar had a golden statue made. It was 90 feet tall and nine feet wide. He erected it on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
21810	27	3	2	Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent out a summons to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other authorities of the province to attend the dedication of the statue that he had erected.
21811	27	3	3	So the satraps, prefects, governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other provincial authorities assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected. They were standing in front of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had erected.
21812	27	3	4	¶Then the herald made a loud proclamation: “To you, O peoples, nations, and language groups, the following command is given:
21813	27	3	5	When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music<b>,</b> you must bow down and pay homage to the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has erected.
21814	27	3	6	Whoever does not bow down and pay homage will immediately be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire!”
21815	27	3	7	Therefore when they all heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations, and language groups began bowing down and paying homage to the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected.
21816	27	3	8	¶Now at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought malicious accusations against the Jews.
21817	27	3	9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever!
21818	27	3	10	You have issued an edict, O king, that everyone must bow down and pay homage to the golden statue when they hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music.
21819	27	3	11	And whoever does not bow down and pay homage must be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.
21820	27	3	12	But there are Jewish men whom you appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon – Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego – and these men have not shown proper respect to you, O king. They don’t serve your gods and they don’t pay homage to the golden statue that you have erected.”
21821	27	3	13	¶Then Nebuchadnezzar in a fit of rage demanded that they bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego before him. So they brought them before the king.
21822	27	3	14	Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don’t serve my gods and that you don’t pay homage to the golden statue that I erected?
21823	27	3	15	Now if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music<b>,</b> you must bow down and pay homage to the statue that I had made. If you don’t pay homage to it, you will immediately be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire. Now, who is that god who can rescue you from my power?”
21824	27	3	16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to King Nebuchadnezzar, “We do not need to give you a reply concerning this.
21825	27	3	17	If our God whom we are serving exists, he is able to rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and he will rescue us, O king, from your power as well.
21826	27	3	18	But if he does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we don’t serve your gods, and we will not pay homage to the golden statue that you have erected.”
21827	27	3	19	¶Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and his disposition changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than it was normally heated.
21828	27	3	20	He ordered strong soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.
21829	27	3	21	So those men were tied up while still wearing their cloaks, trousers, turbans, and other clothes, and were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire.
21830	27	3	22	But since the king’s command was so urgent, and the furnace was so excessively hot, the men who escorted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were killed by the leaping flames.
21831	27	3	23	But those three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell into the furnace of blazing fire while still securely bound.
21832	27	3	24	¶Then King Nebuchadnezzar was startled and quickly got up. He said to his ministers, “Wasn’t it three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?” They replied to the king, “For sure, O king.”
21833	27	3	25	He answered, “But I see four men, untied and walking around in the midst of the fire! No harm has come to them! And the appearance of the fourth is like that of a god!”
21834	27	3	26	Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire. He called out, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the most high God, come out! Come here!” ¶Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego emerged from the fire.
21835	27	3	27	Once the satraps, prefects, governors, and ministers of the king had gathered around, they saw that those men were physically unharmed by the fire. The hair of their heads was not singed, nor were their trousers damaged. Not even the smell of fire was to be found on them!
21836	27	3	28	¶Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, “Praised be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent forth his angel and has rescued his servants who trusted in him, ignoring the edict of the king and giving up their bodies rather than serve or pay homage to any god other than their God!
21837	27	3	29	I hereby decree that any people, nation, or language group that blasphemes the god of Shadrach, Meshach, or Abednego will be dismembered and his home reduced to rubble! For there exists no other god who can deliver in this way.”
21838	27	3	30	Then Nebuchadnezzar promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
21839	27	4	1	¶(3:31) “King Nebuchadnezzar, to all peoples, nations, and language groups that live in all the land: Peace and prosperity!
21840	27	4	2	I am delighted to tell you about the signs and wonders that the most high God has done for me.
21841	27	4	3	‡“How great are his signs! ‡How mighty are his wonders! ‡His kingdom will last forever, ‡and his authority continues from one generation to the next.”
21842	27	4	4	¶(4:1) I, Nebuchadnezzar, was relaxing in my home, living luxuriously in my palace.
21843	27	4	5	I saw a dream that frightened me badly. The things I imagined while lying on my bed – these visions of my mind – were terrifying me.
21844	27	4	6	So I issued an order for all the wise men of Babylon to be brought before me so that they could make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
21845	27	4	7	When the magicians, astrologers, wise men, and diviners entered, I recounted the dream for them. But they were unable to make known its interpretation to me.
21846	27	4	8	Later Daniel entered (whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom there is a spirit of the holy gods). I recounted the dream for him as well,
21847	27	4	9	saying, “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, in whom I know there to be a spirit of the holy gods and whom no mystery baffles, consider my dream that I saw and set forth its interpretation!
21848	27	4	10	Here are the visions of my mind while I was on my bed. ‡While I was watching,‡there was a tree in the middle of the land. ‡It was enormously tall.
21849	27	4	11	‡The tree grew large and strong.‡Its top reached far into the sky;‡it could be seen from the borders of all the land.
21850	27	4	12	‡Its foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful;‡on it there was food enough for all.‡Under it the wild animals used to seek shade,‡and in its branches the birds of the sky used to nest.‡All creatures used to feed themselves from it.
21851	27	4	13	‡While I was watching in my mind’s visions on my bed,‡a holy sentinel came down from heaven.
21852	27	4	14	‡He called out loudly as follows: ‡‘Chop down the tree and lop off its branches!‡Strip off its foliage‡and scatter its fruit!‡Let the animals flee from under it‡and the birds from its branches!
21853	27	4	15	‡But leave its taproot in the ground,‡with a band of iron and bronze around it ‡surrounded by the grass of the field.‡Let it become damp with the dew of the sky,‡and let it live with the animals in the grass of the land.
21854	27	4	16	‡Let his mind be altered from that of a human being,‡and let an animal’s mind be given to him,‡and let seven periods of time go by for him.
21855	27	4	17	‡This announcement is by the decree of the sentinels;‡this decision is by the pronouncement of the holy ones, ‡so that those who are alive may understand ‡that the Most High has authority over human kingdoms, ‡and he bestows them on whomever he wishes.‡He establishes over them even the lowliest of human beings.’
21856	27	4	18	¶“This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, for none of the wise men in my kingdom are able to make known to me the interpretation. But you can do so, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
21857	27	4	19	¶Then Daniel (whose name is also Belteshazzar) was upset for a brief time; his thoughts were alarming him. The king said, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream and its interpretation alarm you.” But Belteshazzar replied, “Sir, if only the dream were for your enemies and its interpretation applied to your adversaries!
21858	27	4	20	The tree that you saw that grew large and strong, whose top reached to the sky, and which could be seen in all the land,
21859	27	4	21	whose foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful, and from which there was food available for all, under whose branches wild animals used to live, and in whose branches birds of the sky used to nest –
21860	27	4	22	it is you, O king! For you have become great and strong. Your greatness is such that it reaches to heaven, and your authority to the ends of the earth.
21861	27	4	23	As for the king seeing a holy sentinel coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave its taproot in the ground, with a band of iron and bronze around it, surrounded by the grass of the field. Let it become damp with the dew of the sky, and let it live with the wild animals, until seven periods of time go by for him’ –
21862	27	4	24	this is the interpretation, O king! It is the decision of the Most High that this has happened to my lord the king.
21863	27	4	25	You will be driven from human society, and you will live with the wild animals. You will be fed grass like oxen, and you will become damp with the dew of the sky. Seven periods of time will pass by for you, before you understand that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he wishes.
21864	27	4	26	They said to leave the taproot of the tree, for your kingdom will be restored to you when you come to understand that heaven rules.
21865	27	4	27	Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you. Break away from your sins by doing what is right, and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps your prosperity will be prolonged.”
21866	27	4	28	¶Now all of this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
21867	27	4	29	After twelve months, he happened to be walking around on the battlements of the royal palace of Babylon.
21868	27	4	30	The king uttered these words: “Is this not the great Babylon that I have built for a royal residence by my own mighty strength and for my majestic honor?”
21869	27	4	31	While these words were still on the king’s lips, a voice came down from heaven: “It is hereby announced to you, King Nebuchadnezzar, that your kingdom has been removed from you!
21870	27	4	32	You will be driven from human society, and you will live with the wild animals. You will be fed grass like oxen, and seven periods of time will pass by for you before you understand that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he wishes.”
21871	27	4	33	¶Now in that very moment this pronouncement about Nebuchadnezzar came true. He was driven from human society, he ate grass like oxen, and his body became damp with the dew of the sky, until his hair became long like an eagle’s feathers, and his nails like a bird’s claws.
21872	27	4	34	¶But at the end of the appointed time I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up toward heaven, and my sanity returned to me.‡I extolled the Most High, ‡and I praised and glorified the one who lives forever. ‡For his authority is an everlasting authority, ‡and his kingdom extends from one generation to the next.
21873	27	4	35	‡All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing. ‡He does as he wishes with the army of heaven‡and with those who inhabit the earth.‡No one slaps his hand‡and says to him, ‘What have you done?’
21874	27	4	36	¶At that time my sanity returned to me. I was restored to the honor of my kingdom<b>,</b> and my splendor returned to me. My ministers and my nobles were seeking me out, and I was reinstated over my kingdom. I became even greater than before.
21875	27	4	37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, for all his deeds are right and his ways are just. He is able to bring down those who live in pride.
21876	27	5	1	¶King Belshazzar prepared a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in front of them all.
21877	27	5	2	While under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar issued an order to bring in the gold and silver vessels – the ones that Nebuchadnezzar his father had confiscated from the temple in Jerusalem – so that the king and his nobles, together with his wives and his concubines, could drink from them.
21878	27	5	3	So they brought the gold and silver vessels that had been confiscated from the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, together with his wives and concubines, drank from them.
21879	27	5	4	As they drank wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
21880	27	5	5	¶At that very moment the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the royal palace wall, opposite the lampstand. The king was watching the back of the hand that was writing.
21881	27	5	6	Then all the color drained from the king’s face and he became alarmed. The joints of his hips gave way, and his knees began knocking together.
21882	27	5	7	The king called out loudly to summon the astrologers, wise men, and diviners. The king proclaimed to the wise men of Babylon that anyone who could read this inscription and disclose its interpretation would be clothed in purple and have a golden collar placed on his neck and be third ruler in the kingdom.
21883	27	5	8	¶So all the king’s wise men came in, but they were unable to read the writing or to make known its interpretation to the king.
21884	27	5	9	Then King Belshazzar was very terrified, and he was visibly shaken. His nobles were completely dumbfounded.
21885	27	5	10	¶Due to the noise caused by the king and his nobles, the queen mother then entered the banquet room. She said, “O king, live forever! Don’t be alarmed! Don’t be shaken!
21886	27	5	11	There is a man in your kingdom who has within him a spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, he proved to have insight, discernment, and wisdom like that of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar your father appointed him chief of the magicians, astrologers, wise men, and diviners.
21887	27	5	12	Thus there was found in this man Daniel, whom the king renamed Belteshazzar, an extraordinary spirit, knowledge, and skill to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. Now summon Daniel, and he will disclose the interpretation.”
21888	27	5	13	¶So Daniel was brought in before the king. The king said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the captives of Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah?
21889	27	5	14	I have heard about you, how there is a spirit of the gods in you, and how you have insight, discernment, and extraordinary wisdom.
21890	27	5	15	Now the wise men and astrologers were brought before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation. But they were unable to disclose the interpretation of the message.
21891	27	5	16	However, I have heard that you are able to provide interpretations and to solve difficult problems. Now if you are able to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, you will wear purple and have a golden collar around your neck and be third ruler in the kingdom.”
21892	27	5	17	¶But Daniel replied to the king, “Keep your gifts, and give your rewards to someone else! However, I will read the writing for the king and make known its interpretation.
21893	27	5	18	As for you, O king, the most high God bestowed on your father Nebuchadnezzar a kingdom, greatness, honor, and majesty.
21894	27	5	19	Due to the greatness that he bestowed on him, all peoples, nations, and language groups were trembling with fear before him. He killed whom he wished, he spared whom he wished, he exalted whom he wished, and he brought low whom he wished.
21895	27	5	20	And when his mind became arrogant and his spirit filled with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and his honor was removed from him.
21896	27	5	21	He was driven from human society, his mind was changed to that of an animal, he lived with the wild donkeys, he was fed grass like oxen, and his body became damp with the dew of the sky, until he came to understand that the most high God rules over human kingdoms, and he appoints over them whomever he wishes.
21897	27	5	22	¶“But you, his son Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself, although you knew all this.
21898	27	5	23	Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. You brought before you the vessels from his temple, and you and your nobles, together with your wives and concubines, drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone – gods that cannot see or hear or comprehend! But you have not glorified the God who has in his control your very breath and all your ways!
21899	27	5	24	Therefore the palm of a hand was sent from him, and this writing was inscribed.
21900	27	5	25	¶“This is the writing that was inscribed: <span class=\"smcaps\">mene</span>, <span class=\"smcaps\">mene</span>, <span class=\"smcaps\">teqel</span>, and <span class=\"smcaps\">pharsin</span>.
21901	27	5	26	This is the interpretation of the words: As for <i>mene</i> – God has numbered your kingdom’s days and brought it to an end.
21902	27	5	27	As for <i>teqel</i> – you are weighed on the balances and found to be lacking.
21903	27	5	28	As for <i>peres</i> – your kingdom is divided and given over to the Medes and Persians.”
21904	27	5	29	¶Then, on Belshazzar’s orders, Daniel was clothed in purple, a golden collar was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed third ruler in the kingdom.
21905	27	5	30	And in that very night Belshazzar, the Babylonian king, was killed.
21906	27	5	31	(6:1) So Darius the Mede took control of the kingdom when he was about sixty-two years old.
21907	27	6	1	¶It seemed like a good idea to Darius to appoint over the kingdom 120 satraps who would be in charge of the entire kingdom.
21908	27	6	2	Over them would be three supervisors, one of whom was Daniel. These satraps were accountable to them, so that the king’s interests might not incur damage.
21909	27	6	3	Now this Daniel was distinguishing himself above the other supervisors and the satraps, for he had an extraordinary spirit. In fact, the king intended to appoint him over the entire kingdom.
21910	27	6	4	Consequently the supervisors and satraps were trying to find some pretext against Daniel in connection with administrative matters. But they were unable to find any such damaging evidence, because he was trustworthy and guilty of no negligence or corruption.
21911	27	6	5	So these men concluded, “We won’t find any pretext against this man Daniel unless it is in connection with the law of his God.”
21912	27	6	6	¶So these supervisors and satraps came by collusion to the king and said to him, “O King Darius, live forever!
21913	27	6	7	To all the supervisors of the kingdom, the prefects, satraps, counselors, and governors it seemed like a good idea for a royal edict to be issued and an interdict to be enforced. For the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human other than you, O king, should be thrown into a den of lions.
21914	27	6	8	Now let the king issue a written interdict so that it cannot be altered, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.”
21915	27	6	9	So King Darius issued the written interdict.
21916	27	6	10	¶When Daniel realized that a written decree had been issued, he entered his home, where the windows in his upper room opened toward Jerusalem. Three times daily he was kneeling and offering prayers and thanks to his God just as he had been accustomed to do previously.
21917	27	6	11	Then those officials who had gone to the king came by collusion and found Daniel praying and asking for help before his God.
21918	27	6	12	So they approached the king and said to him, “Did you not issue an edict to the effect that for the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human other than to you, O king, would be thrown into a den of lions?” The king replied, “That is correct, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.”
21919	27	6	13	Then they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the captives from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the edict that you issued. Three times daily he offers his prayer.”
21920	27	6	14	¶When the king heard this, he was very upset and began thinking about how he might rescue Daniel. Until late afternoon he was struggling to find a way to rescue him.
21921	27	6	15	Then those men came by collusion to the king and said to him, “Recall, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no edict or decree that the king issues can be changed.”
21922	27	6	16	So the king gave the order, and Daniel was brought and thrown into a den of lions. The king consoled Daniel by saying, “Your God whom you continually serve will rescue you!”
21923	27	6	17	Then a stone was brought and placed over the opening to the den. The king sealed it with his signet ring and with those of his nobles so that nothing could be changed with regard to Daniel.
21924	27	6	18	Then the king departed to his palace. But he spent the night without eating, and no diversions were brought to him. He was unable to sleep.
21925	27	6	19	¶In the morning, at the earliest sign of daylight, the king got up and rushed to the lions’ den.
21926	27	6	20	As he approached the den, he called out to Daniel in a worried voice, “Daniel, servant of the living God, was your God whom you continually serve able to rescue you from the lions?”
21927	27	6	21	¶Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live forever!
21928	27	6	22	My God sent his angel and closed the lions’ mouths so that they have not harmed me, because I was found to be innocent before him. Nor have I done any harm to you, O king.”
21929	27	6	23	¶Then the king was delighted and gave an order to haul Daniel up from the den. So Daniel was hauled up out of the den. He had no injury of any kind, because he had trusted in his God.
21930	27	6	24	The king gave another order, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the lions’ den – they, their children, and their wives. They did not even reach the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
21931	27	6	25	¶Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and language groups who were living in all the land: “Peace and prosperity!
21932	27	6	26	I have issued an edict that throughout all the dominion of my kingdom people are to revere and fear the God of Daniel. ‡“For he is the living God;‡he endures forever.‡His kingdom will not be destroyed;‡his authority is forever.
21933	27	6	27	‡He rescues and delivers ‡and performs signs and wonders‡in the heavens and on the earth.‡He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions!”
21934	27	6	28	¶So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
21935	27	7	1	¶In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream filled with visions while he was lying on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream in summary fashion.
21936	27	7	2	Daniel explained: “I was watching in my vision during the night as the four winds of the sky were stirring up the great sea.
21937	27	7	3	Then four large beasts came up from the sea; they were different from one another.
21938	27	7	4	¶“The first one was like a lion with eagles’ wings. As I watched, its wings were pulled off and it was lifted up from the ground. It was made to stand on two feet like a human being, and a human mind was given to it.
21939	27	7	5	¶“Then a second beast appeared, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and devour much flesh!’
21940	27	7	6	¶“After these things, as I was watching, another beast like a leopard appeared, with four bird-like wings on its back. This beast had four heads, and ruling authority was given to it.
21941	27	7	7	¶“After these things, as I was watching in the night visions a fourth beast appeared – one dreadful, terrible, and very strong. It had two large rows of iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and anything that was left it trampled with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that came before it, and it had ten horns.
21942	27	7	8	¶“As I was contemplating the horns, another horn – a small one – came up between them, and three of the former horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it. This horn had eyes resembling human eyes and a mouth speaking arrogant things.
21943	27	7	9	¶“While I was watching,‡thrones were set up,‡and the Ancient of Days took his seat.‡His attire was white like snow;‡the hair of his head was like lamb’s wool.‡His throne was ablaze with fire‡and its wheels were all aflame.
21944	27	7	10	‡A river of fire was streaming forth‡and proceeding from his presence.‡Many thousands were ministering to him;‡many tens of thousands stood ready to serve him. ‡The court convened ‡and the books were opened.
21945	27	7	11	¶“Then I kept on watching because of the arrogant words of the horn that was speaking. I was watching until the beast was killed and its body destroyed and thrown into the flaming fire.
21946	27	7	12	As for the rest of the beasts, their ruling authority had already been removed, though they were permitted to go on living for a time and a season.
21947	27	7	13	I was watching in the night visions,‡“And with the clouds of the sky ‡one like a son of man was approaching.‡He went up to the Ancient of Days‡and was escorted before him.
21948	27	7	14	‡To him was given ruling authority, honor, and sovereignty.‡All peoples, nations, and language groups were serving him.‡His authority is eternal and will not pass away. ‡His kingdom will not be destroyed.
21949	27	7	15	¶“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed, and the visions of my mind were alarming me.
21950	27	7	16	I approached one of those standing nearby and asked him about the meaning of all this. So he spoke with me and revealed to me the interpretation of the vision:
21951	27	7	17	‘These large beasts, which are four in number, represent four kings who will arise from the earth.
21952	27	7	18	The holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will take possession of the kingdom forever and ever.’
21953	27	7	19	¶“Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others. It was very dreadful, with two rows of iron teeth and bronze claws, and it devoured, crushed, and trampled anything that was left with its feet.
21954	27	7	20	I also wanted to know the meaning of the ten horns on its head, and of that other horn which came up and before which three others fell. This was the horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogant things, whose appearance was more formidable than the others.
21955	27	7	21	While I was watching, that horn began to wage war against the holy ones and was defeating them,
21956	27	7	22	until the Ancient of Days arrived and judgment was rendered in favor of the holy ones of the Most High. Then the time came for the holy ones to take possession of the kingdom.
21957	27	7	23	‡“This is what he told me: ‡‘The fourth beast means that there will be a fourth kingdom on earth‡that will differ from all the other kingdoms.‡It will devour all the earth‡and will trample and crush it.
21958	27	7	24	‡The ten horns‡mean that ten kings will arise from that kingdom.‡Another king will arise after them,‡but he will be different from the earlier ones.‡He will humiliate three kings.
21959	27	7	25	‡He will speak words against the Most High.‡He will harass the holy ones of the Most High continually.‡His intention will be to change times established by law. ‡They will be delivered into his hand‡For a time, times, and half a time.
21960	27	7	26	‡But the court will convene, and his ruling authority will be removed – ‡destroyed and abolished forever!
21961	27	7	27	‡Then the kingdom, authority,‡and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven‡will be delivered to the people of the holy ones of the Most High.‡His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; ‡all authorities will serve him and obey him.’
21962	27	7	28	¶“This is the conclusion of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and the color drained from my face. But I kept the matter to myself.”
21963	27	8	1	¶In the third year of King Belshazzar’s reign, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me previously.
21964	27	8	2	In this vision I saw myself in Susa the citadel, which is located in the province of Elam. In the vision I saw myself at the Ulai Canal.
21965	27	8	3	I looked up and saw a ram with two horns standing at the canal. Its two horns were both long, but one was longer than the other. The longer one was coming up after the shorter one.
21966	27	8	4	I saw that the ram was butting westward, northward, and southward. No animal was able to stand before it, and there was none who could deliver from its power. It did as it pleased and acted arrogantly.
21967	27	8	5	¶While I was contemplating all this, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of all the land without touching the ground. This goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes.
21968	27	8	6	It came to the two-horned ram that I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed against it with raging strength.
21969	27	8	7	I saw it approaching the ram. It went into a fit of rage against the ram and struck it and broke off its two horns. The ram had no ability to resist it. The goat hurled the ram to the ground and trampled it. No one could deliver the ram from its power.
21970	27	8	8	The male goat acted even more arrogantly. But no sooner had the large horn become strong than it was broken, and there arose four conspicuous horns in its place, extending toward the four winds of the sky.
21971	27	8	9	¶From one of them came a small horn. But it grew to be very big, toward the south and the east and toward the beautiful land.
21972	27	8	10	It grew so big it reached the army of heaven, and it brought about the fall of some of the army and some of the stars to the ground, where it trampled them.
21973	27	8	11	It also acted arrogantly against the Prince of the army, from whom the daily sacrifice was removed and whose sanctuary was thrown down.
21974	27	8	12	The army was given over, along with the daily sacrifice, in the course of his sinful rebellion. It hurled truth to the ground and enjoyed success.
21975	27	8	13	¶Then I heard a holy one speaking. Another holy one said to the one who was speaking, “To what period of time does the vision pertain – this vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the destructive act of rebellion and the giving over of both the sanctuary and army to be trampled?”
21976	27	8	14	He said to me, “To 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be put right again.”
21977	27	8	15	¶While I, Daniel, was watching the vision, I sought to understand it. Now one who appeared to be a man was standing before me.
21978	27	8	16	Then I heard a human voice coming from between the banks of the Ulai. It called out, “Gabriel, enable this person to understand the vision.”
21979	27	8	17	So he approached the place where I was standing. As he came, I felt terrified and fell flat on the ground. Then he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision pertains to the time of the end.”
21980	27	8	18	As he spoke with me, I fell into a trance with my face to the ground. But he touched me and stood me upright.
21981	27	8	19	¶Then he said, “I am going to inform you about what will happen in the latter time of wrath, for the vision pertains to the appointed time of the end.
21982	27	8	20	The ram that you saw with the two horns stands for the kings of Media and Persia.
21983	27	8	21	The male goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king.
21984	27	8	22	The horn that was broken and in whose place there arose four others stands for four kingdoms that will arise from his nation, though they will not have his strength.
21985	27	8	23	Toward the end of their rule, when rebellious acts are complete, a rash and deceitful king will arise.
21986	27	8	24	His power will be great, but it will not be by his strength alone. He will cause terrible destruction. He will be successful in what he undertakes. He will destroy powerful people and the people of the holy ones.
21987	27	8	25	By his treachery he will succeed through deceit. He will have an arrogant attitude, and he will destroy many who are unaware of his schemes. He will rise up against the Prince of princes, yet he will be broken apart – but not by human agency.
21988	27	8	26	The vision of the evenings and mornings that was told to you is correct. But you should seal up the vision, for it refers to a time many days from now.”
21989	27	8	27	¶I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up and again carried out the king’s business. But I was astonished at the vision, and there was no one to explain it.
21990	27	9	1	¶In the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, who was of Median descent and who had been appointed king over the Babylonian empire –
21991	27	9	2	in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, came to understand from the sacred books that the number of years for the fulfilling of the desolation of Jerusalem, which had come as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message to the prophet Jeremiah, would be 70 years.
21992	27	9	3	So I turned my attention to the Lord God to implore him by prayer and requests, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
21993	27	9	4	I prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God, confessing in this way: ¶“O Lord, great and awesome God who is faithful to his covenant with those who love him and keep his commandments,
21994	27	9	5	we have sinned! We have done what is wrong and wicked; we have rebelled by turning away from your commandments and standards.
21995	27	9	6	We have not paid attention to your servants the prophets, who spoke by your authority to our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors, and to all the inhabitants of the land as well.
21996	27	9	7	¶“You are righteous, O Lord, but we are humiliated this day – the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far away in all the countries in which you have scattered them, because they have behaved unfaithfully toward you.
21997	27	9	8	O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, we have been humiliated – our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors – because we have sinned against you.
21998	27	9	9	Yet the Lord our God is compassionate and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him.
21999	27	9	10	We have not obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God by living according to his laws that he set before us through his servants the prophets.
22000	27	9	11	¶“All Israel has broken your law and turned away by not obeying you. Therefore you have poured out on us the judgment solemnly threatened in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against you.
22001	27	9	12	He has carried out his threats against us and our rulers who were over us by bringing great calamity on us – what has happened to Jerusalem has never been equaled under all heaven!
22002	27	9	13	Just as it is written in the law of Moses, so all this calamity has come on us. Still we have not tried to pacify the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God by turning back from our sin and by seeking wisdom from your reliable moral standards.
22003	27	9	14	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was mindful of the calamity, and he brought it on us. For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God is just in all he has done, and we have not obeyed him.
22004	27	9	15	¶“Now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with great power and made a name for yourself that is remembered to this day – we have sinned and behaved wickedly.
22005	27	9	16	O Lord, according to all your justice, please turn your raging anger away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. For due to our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people are mocked by all our neighbors.
22006	27	9	17	¶“So now, our God, accept the prayer and requests of your servant, and show favor to your devastated sanctuary for your own sake.
22007	27	9	18	Listen attentively, my God, and hear! Open your eyes and look on our desolated ruins and the city called by your name. For it is not because of our own righteous deeds that we are praying to you, but because your compassion is abundant.
22008	27	9	19	O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, pay attention, and act! Don’t delay, for your own sake, O my God! For your city and your people are called by your name.”
22009	27	9	20	¶While I was still speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my request before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God concerning his holy mountain –
22010	27	9	21	yes, while I was still praying, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen previously in a vision, was approaching me in my state of extreme weariness, around the time of the evening offering.
22011	27	9	22	He spoke with me, instructing me as follows: “Daniel, I have now come to impart understanding to you.
22012	27	9	23	At the beginning of your requests a message went out, and I have come to convey it to you, for you are of great value in God’s sight. Therefore consider the message and understand the vision:
22013	27	9	24	‡“Seventy weeks have been determined‡concerning your people and your holy city‡to put an end to rebellion,‡to bring sin to completion, ‡to atone for iniquity,‡to bring in perpetual righteousness,‡to seal up the prophetic vision, ‡and to anoint a most holy place.
22014	27	9	25	‡So know and understand:‡From the issuing of the command to restore and rebuild ‡Jerusalem until an anointed one, a prince arrives, ‡there will be a period of seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.‡It will again be built, with plaza and moat,‡but in distressful times.
22015	27	9	26	‡Now after the sixty-two weeks, ‡an anointed one will be cut off and have nothing. ‡As for the city and the sanctuary,‡the people of the coming prince will destroy them.‡But his end will come speedily like a flood. ‡Until the end of the war that has been decreed‡there will be destruction.
22016	27	9	27	‡He will confirm a covenant with many for one week. ‡But in the middle of that week‡he will bring sacrifices and offerings to a halt.‡On the wing of abominations will come one who destroys,‡until the decreed end is poured out on the one who destroys.”
22017	27	10	1	¶In the third year of King Cyrus of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel (who was also called Belteshazzar). This message was true and concerned a great war. He understood the message and gained insight by the vision.
22018	27	10	2	¶In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three whole weeks.
22019	27	10	3	I ate no choice food; no meat or wine came to my lips, nor did I anoint myself with oil until the end of those three weeks.
22020	27	10	4	¶On the twenty-fourth day of the first month I was beside the great river, the Tigris.
22021	27	10	5	I looked up and saw a man clothed in linen; around his waist was a belt made of gold from Ufaz.
22022	27	10	6	His body resembled yellow jasper, and his face had an appearance like lightning. His eyes were like blazing torches; his arms and feet had the gleam of polished bronze. His voice thundered forth like the sound of a large crowd.
22023	27	10	7	¶Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men who were with me did not see it. On the contrary, they were overcome with fright and ran away to hide.
22024	27	10	8	I alone was left to see this great vision. My strength drained from me, and my vigor disappeared; I was without energy.
22025	27	10	9	I listened to his voice, and as I did so I fell into a trance-like sleep with my face to the ground.
22026	27	10	10	Then a hand touched me and set me on my hands and knees.
22027	27	10	11	He said to me, “Daniel, you are of great value. Understand the words that I am about to speak to you. So stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” When he said this to me, I stood up shaking.
22028	27	10	12	Then he said to me, “Don’t be afraid, Daniel, for from the very first day you applied your mind to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come in response to your words.
22029	27	10	13	However, the prince of the kingdom of Persia was opposing me for twenty-one days. But Michael, one of the leading princes, came to help me, because I was left there with the kings of Persia.
22030	27	10	14	Now I have come to help you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to future days.”
22031	27	10	15	¶While he was saying this to me, I was flat on the ground and unable to speak.
22032	27	10	16	Then one who appeared to be a human being was touching my lips. I opened my mouth and started to speak, saying to the one who was standing before me, “Sir, due to the vision, anxiety has gripped me and I have no strength.
22033	27	10	17	How, sir, am I able to speak with you? My strength is gone, and I am breathless.”
22034	27	10	18	Then the one who appeared to be a human being touched me again and strengthened me.
22035	27	10	19	He said to me, “Don’t be afraid, you who are valued. Peace be to you! Be strong! Be really strong!” When he spoke to me, I was strengthened. I said, “Sir, you may speak now, for you have given me strength.”
22036	27	10	20	He said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Now I am about to return to engage in battle with the prince of Persia. When I go, the prince of Greece is coming.
22037	27	10	21	However, I will first tell you what is written in a dependable book. (There is no one who strengthens me against these princes, except Michael your prince.
22038	27	11	1	And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood to strengthen him and to provide protection for him.)
22039	27	11	2	Now I will tell you the truth.¶“Three more kings will arise for Persia. Then a fourth king will be unusually rich, more so than all who preceded him. When he has amassed power through his riches, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.
22040	27	11	3	Then a powerful king will arise, exercising great authority and doing as he pleases.
22041	27	11	4	Shortly after his rise to power, his kingdom will be broken up and distributed toward the four winds of the sky – but not to his posterity or with the authority he exercised, for his kingdom will be uprooted and distributed to others besides these.
22042	27	11	5	¶“Then the king of the south and one of his subordinates will grow strong. His subordinate will resist him and will rule a kingdom greater than his.
22043	27	11	6	After some years have passed, they will form an alliance. Then the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but she will not retain her power, nor will he continue in his strength. She, together with the one who brought her, her child, and her benefactor will all be delivered over at that time.
22044	27	11	7	¶“There will arise in his place one from her family line who will come against their army and will enter the stronghold of the king of the north and will move against them successfully.
22045	27	11	8	He will also take their gods into captivity to Egypt, along with their cast images and prized utensils of silver and gold. Then he will withdraw for some years from the king of the north.
22046	27	11	9	Then the king of the north will advance against the empire of the king of the south, but will withdraw to his own land.
22047	27	11	10	His sons will wage war, mustering a large army which will advance like an overflowing river and carrying the battle all the way to the enemy’s fortress.
22048	27	11	11	¶“Then the king of the south will be enraged and will march out to fight against the king of the north, who will also muster a large army, but that army will be delivered into his hand.
22049	27	11	12	When the army is taken away, the king of the south will become arrogant. He will be responsible for the death of thousands and thousands of people, but he will not continue to prevail.
22050	27	11	13	For the king of the north will again muster an army, one larger than before. At the end of some years he will advance with a huge army and enormous supplies.
22051	27	11	14	¶“In those times many will oppose the king of the south. Those who are violent among your own people will rise up in confirmation of the vision, but they will falter.
22052	27	11	15	Then the king of the north will advance and will build siege mounds and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the south will not prevail, not even his finest contingents. They will have no strength to prevail.
22053	27	11	16	The one advancing against him will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to stand before him. He will prevail in the beautiful land, and its annihilation will be within his power.
22054	27	11	17	His intention will be to come with the strength of his entire kingdom, and he will form alliances. He will give the king of the south a daughter in marriage in order to destroy the kingdom, but it will not turn out to his advantage.
22055	27	11	18	Then he will turn his attention to the coastal regions and will capture many of them. But a commander will bring his shameful conduct to a halt; in addition, he will make him pay for his shameful conduct.
22056	27	11	19	He will then turn his attention to the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall, not to be found again.
22057	27	11	20	There will arise after him one who will send out an exactor of tribute to enhance the splendor of the kingdom, but after a few days he will be destroyed, though not in anger or battle.
22058	27	11	21	¶“Then there will arise in his place a despicable person to whom the royal honor has not been rightfully conferred. He will come on the scene in a time of prosperity and will seize the kingdom through deceit.
22059	27	11	22	Armies will be suddenly swept away in defeat before him; both they and a covenant leader will be destroyed.
22060	27	11	23	After entering into an alliance with him, he will behave treacherously; he will ascend to power with only a small force.
22061	27	11	24	In a time of prosperity for the most productive areas of the province he will come and accomplish what neither his fathers nor their fathers accomplished. He will distribute loot, spoils, and property to his followers, and he will devise plans against fortified cities, but not for long.
22062	27	11	25	He will rouse his strength and enthusiasm against the king of the south with a large army. The king of the south will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to prevail because of the plans devised against him.
22063	27	11	26	Those who share the king’s fine food will attempt to destroy him, and his army will be swept away; many will be killed in battle.
22064	27	11	27	These two kings, their minds filled with evil intentions, will trade lies with one another at the same table. But it will not succeed, for there is still an end at the appointed time.
22065	27	11	28	Then the king of the north will return to his own land with much property. His mind will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action, and then return to his own land.
22066	27	11	29	At an appointed time he will again invade the south, but this latter visit will not turn out the way the former one did.
22067	27	11	30	The ships of Kittim will come against him, leaving him disheartened. He will turn back and direct his indignation against the holy covenant. He will return and honor those who forsake the holy covenant.
22068	27	11	31	His forces will rise up and profane the fortified sanctuary, stopping the daily sacrifice. In its place they will set up the abomination that causes desolation.
22069	27	11	32	Then with smooth words he will defile those who have rejected the covenant. But the people who are loyal to their God will act valiantly.
22070	27	11	33	These who are wise among the people will teach the masses. However, they will fall by the sword and by the flame, and they will be imprisoned and plundered for some time.
22071	27	11	34	When they stumble, they will be granted some help. But many will unite with them deceitfully.
22072	27	11	35	Even some of the wise will stumble, resulting in their refinement, purification, and cleansing until the time of the end, for it is still for the appointed time.
22073	27	11	36	¶“Then the king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every deity and he will utter presumptuous things against the God of gods. He will succeed until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been decreed must occur.
22074	27	11	37	He will not respect the gods of his fathers – not even the god loved by women. He will not respect any god; he will elevate himself above them all.
22075	27	11	38	What he will honor is a god of fortresses – a god his fathers did not acknowledge he will honor with gold, silver, valuable stones, and treasured commodities.
22076	27	11	39	He will attack mighty fortresses, aided by a foreign deity. To those who recognize him he will grant considerable honor. He will place them in authority over many people, and he will parcel out land for a price.
22077	27	11	40	¶“At the time of the end the king of the south will attack him. Then the king of the north will storm against him with chariots, horsemen, and a large armada of ships. He will invade lands, passing through them like an overflowing river.
22078	27	11	41	Then he will enter the beautiful land. Many will fall, but these will escape: Edom, Moab, and the Ammonite leadership.
22079	27	11	42	He will extend his power against other lands; the land of Egypt will not escape.
22080	27	11	43	He will have control over the hidden stores of gold and silver, as well as all the treasures of Egypt. Libyans and Ethiopians will submit to him.
22081	27	11	44	But reports will trouble him from the east and north, and he will set out in a tremendous rage to destroy and wipe out many.
22082	27	11	45	He will pitch his royal tents between the seas toward the beautiful holy mountain. But he will come to his end, with no one to help him.
22083	27	12	1	‡“At that time Michael, ‡the great prince who watches over your people, ‡will arise. ‡There will be a time of distress‡unlike any other from the nation’s beginning ‡up to that time.‡But at that time your own people,‡all those whose names are found written in the book,‡will escape.
22084	27	12	2	‡Many of those who sleep‡in the dusty ground will awake – ‡some to everlasting life,‡and others to shame and everlasting abhorrence.
22085	27	12	3	‡But the wise will shine‡like the brightness of the heavenly expanse.‡And those bringing many to righteousness ‡will be like the stars forever and ever.
22086	27	12	4	¶“But you, Daniel, close up these words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many will dash about, and knowledge will increase.”
22087	27	12	5	¶I, Daniel, watched as two others stood there, one on each side of the river.
22088	27	12	6	One said to the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river, “When will the end of these wondrous events occur?”
22089	27	12	7	Then I heard the man clothed in linen who was over the waters of the river as he raised both his right and left hands to the sky and made an oath by the one who lives forever: “It is for a time, times, and half a time. Then, when the power of the one who shatters the holy people has been exhausted, all these things will be finished.”
22090	27	12	8	¶I heard, but I did not understand. So I said, “Sir, what will happen after these things?”
22091	27	12	9	He said, “Go, Daniel. For these matters are closed and sealed until the time of the end.
22092	27	12	10	Many will be purified, made clean, and refined, but the wicked will go on being wicked. None of the wicked will understand, though the wise will understand.
22093	27	12	11	From the time that the daily sacrifice is removed and the abomination that causes desolation is set in place, there are 1,290 days.
22094	27	12	12	Blessed is the one who waits and attains to the 1,335 days.
22095	27	12	13	But you should go your way until the end. You will rest and then at the end of the days you will arise to receive what you have been allotted.”
22096	28	1	1	¶This is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the time of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the time of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel.
22097	28	1	2	¶When the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> first spoke through Hosea, he said to him, “Go marry a prostitute who will bear illegitimate children conceived through prostitution, because the nation continually commits spiritual prostitution by turning away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>”
22098	28	1	3	So Hosea married Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim. Then she conceived and gave birth to a son for him.
22099	28	1	4	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Hosea, “Name him ‘Jezreel,’ because in a little while I will punish the dynasty of Jehu on account of the bloodshed in the valley of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel.
22100	28	1	5	At that time, I will destroy the military power of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.”
22101	28	1	6	¶She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Name her ‘No Pity’ (Lo-Ruhamah) because I will no longer have pity on the nation of Israel. For I will certainly not forgive their guilt.
22102	28	1	7	But I will have pity on the nation of Judah. I will deliver them by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God; I will not deliver them by the warrior’s bow, by sword, by military victory, by chariot horses, or by chariots.”
22103	28	1	8	¶When she had weaned ‘No Pity’ (Lo-Ruhamah) she conceived again and gave birth to another son.
22104	28	1	9	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said: “Name him ‘Not My People’ (Lo-Ammi), because you are not my people and I am not your God.”
22105	28	1	10	¶(2:1) However, in the future the number of the people of Israel will be like the sand of the sea which can be neither measured nor numbered. Although it was said to them, “You are not my people,” it will be said to them, “You are children of the living God!”
22106	28	1	11	Then the people of Judah and the people of Israel will be gathered together. They will appoint for themselves one leader, and will flourish in the land. Certainly, the day of Jezreel will be great!
22107	28	2	1	Then you will call your brother, “My People” (Ammi)! You will call your sister, “Pity” (Ruhamah)!
22108	28	2	2	‡Plead earnestly with your mother ‡(for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband), ‡so that she might put an end to her adulterous lifestyle, ‡and turn away from her sexually immoral behavior.
22109	28	2	3	‡Otherwise, I will strip her naked,‡and expose her like she was when she was born. ‡I will turn her land into a wilderness ‡and make her country a parched land, ‡so that I might kill her with thirst.
22110	28	2	4	‡I will have no pity on her children, ‡because they are children conceived in adultery.
22111	28	2	5	‡For their mother has committed adultery; ‡she who conceived them has acted shamefully. ‡For she said, “I will seek out my lovers; ‡they are the ones who give me my bread and my water, ‡my wool, my flax, my olive oil, and my wine.
22112	28	2	6	‡Therefore, I will soon fence her in with thorns; ‡I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.
22113	28	2	7	‡Then she will pursue her lovers, but she will not catch them; ‡she will seek them, but she will not find them. ‡Then she will say,‡“I will go back to my husband, ‡because I was better off then than I am now.”
22114	28	2	8	‡Yet until now she has refused to acknowledge that I was the one‡who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil; ‡and that it was I who lavished on her the silver and gold – ‡which they used in worshiping Baal!
22115	28	2	9	‡Therefore, I will take back my grain during the harvest time ‡and my new wine when it ripens; ‡I will take away my wool and my flax ‡which I had provided in order to clothe her.
22116	28	2	10	‡Soon I will expose her lewd nakedness in front of her lovers, ‡and no one will be able to rescue her from me!
22117	28	2	11	‡I will put an end to all her celebration: ‡her annual religious festivals, ‡monthly new moon celebrations, ‡and weekly Sabbath festivities – ‡all her appointed festivals.
22118	28	2	12	‡I will destroy her vines and fig trees, ‡about which she said, “These are my wages for prostitution ‡that my lovers gave to me!”‡I will turn her cultivated vines and fig trees into an uncultivated thicket, ‡so that wild animals will devour them.
22119	28	2	13	‡“I will punish her for the festival days‡when she burned incense to the Baal idols; ‡she adorned herself with earrings and jewelry,‡and went after her lovers,‡but she forgot me!” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22120	28	2	14	‡However, in the future I will allure her; ‡I will lead her back into the wilderness, ‡and speak tenderly to her.
22121	28	2	15	‡From there I will give back her vineyards to her, ‡and turn the “Valley of Trouble” into an “Opportunity for Hope.” ‡There she will sing as she did when she was young, ‡when she came up from the land of Egypt.
22122	28	2	16	‡“At that time,” declares the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡“you will call, ‘My husband’; ‡you will never again call me, ‘My master.’
22123	28	2	17	‡For I will remove the names of the Baal idols from your lips, ‡so that you will never again utter their names!”
22124	28	2	18	‡“At that time I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals, ‡the birds of the air, and the creatures that crawl on the ground. ‡I will abolish the warrior’s bow and sword‡– that is, every weapon of warfare – from the land, ‡and I will allow them to live securely.”
22125	28	2	19	‡I will commit myself to you forever; ‡I will commit myself to you in righteousness and justice, ‡in steadfast love and tender compassion.
22126	28	2	20	‡I will commit myself to you in faithfulness; ‡then you will acknowledge the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.”
22127	28	2	21	‡“At that time, I will willingly respond,” declares the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡“I will respond to the sky, ‡and the sky will respond to the ground;
22128	28	2	22	‡then the ground will respond to the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil; ‡and they will respond to ‘God Plants’ (Jezreel)!
22129	28	2	23	‡Then I will plant her as my own in the land. ‡I will have pity on ‘No Pity’ (Lo-Ruhamah). ‡I will say to ‘Not My People’ (Lo-Ammi), ‘You are my people!’ ‡And he will say, ‘You are my God!’”
22130	28	3	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Go, show love to your wife again, even though she loves another man and continually commits adultery. Likewise, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> loves the Israelites although they turn to other gods and love to offer raisin cakes to idols.”
22131	28	3	2	So I paid fifteen shekels of silver and about seven bushels of barley to purchase her.
22132	28	3	3	Then I told her, “You must live with me many days; you must not commit adultery or become joined to another man, and I also will wait for you.”
22133	28	3	4	<b><sup></sup></b> For the Israelites must live many days without a king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred fertility pillar, without ephod or idols.
22134	28	3	5	<b><sup></sup></b> Afterward, the Israelites will turn and seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God and their Davidic king. Then they will submit to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in fear and receive his blessings in the future.
22135	28	4	1	‡Listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message, you Israelites! ‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has a covenant lawsuit against the people of Israel. ‡For there is neither faithfulness nor loyalty in the land, ‡nor do they acknowledge God.
22136	28	4	2	‡There is only cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and adultery.‡They resort to violence and bloodshed.
22137	28	4	3	‡Therefore the land will mourn, ‡and all its inhabitants will perish. ‡The wild animals, the birds of the sky, ‡and even the fish in the sea will perish.
22138	28	4	4	‡Do not let anyone accuse or contend against anyone else: ‡for my case is against you priests!
22139	28	4	5	‡You stumble day and night, ‡and the false prophets stumble with you;‡You have destroyed your own people!
22140	28	4	6	‡You have destroyed my people ‡by failing to acknowledge me! ‡Because you refuse to acknowledge me, ‡I will reject you as my priests.‡Because you reject the law of your God,‡I will reject your descendants.
22141	28	4	7	‡The more the priests increased in numbers, ‡the more they rebelled against me.‡They have turned their glorious calling ‡into a shameful disgrace!
22142	28	4	8	‡They feed on the sin offerings of my people;‡their appetites long for their iniquity!
22143	28	4	9	‡I will deal with the people and priests together: ‡I will punish them both for their ways, ‡and I will repay them for their deeds.
22144	28	4	10	‡They will eat, but not be satisfied;‡they will engage in prostitution, but not increase in numbers;‡because they have abandoned the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡by pursuing other gods.
22145	28	4	11	‡Old and new wine ‡take away the understanding of my people.
22146	28	4	12	‡They consult their wooden idols, ‡and their diviner’s staff answers with an oracle.‡The wind of prostitution blows them astray;‡they commit spiritual adultery against their God.
22147	28	4	13	‡They sacrifice on the mountaintops, ‡and burn offerings on the hills;‡they sacrifice under oak, poplar, and terebinth,‡because their shade is so pleasant.‡As a result, your daughters have become cult prostitutes,‡and your daughters-in-law commit adultery!
22148	28	4	14	‡I will not punish your daughters when they commit prostitution,‡nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.‡For the men consort with harlots, ‡they sacrifice with temple prostitutes.‡It is true: “A people that lacks understanding will come to ruin!”
22149	28	4	15	‡Although you, O Israel, commit adultery,‡do not let Judah become guilty!‡Do not journey to Gilgal! ‡Do not go up to Beth Aven! ‡Do not swear, “As surely as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> lives!”
22150	28	4	16	‡Israel has rebelled like a stubborn heifer!‡Soon the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will put them out to pasture‡like a lamb in a broad field!
22151	28	4	17	‡Ephraim has attached himself to idols;‡Do not go near him!
22152	28	4	18	‡They consume their alcohol, ‡then engage in cult prostitution;‡they dearly love their shameful behavior.
22153	28	4	19	‡A whirlwind has wrapped them in its wings;‡they will be brought to shame because of their idolatrous worship.
22154	28	5	1	‡Hear this, you priests! ‡Pay attention, you Israelites! ‡Listen closely, O king! ‡For judgment is about to overtake you! ‡For you were like a trap to Mizpah, ‡like a net spread out to catch Tabor.
22155	28	5	2	‡Those who revolt are knee-deep in slaughter, ‡but I will discipline them all.
22156	28	5	3	‡I know Ephraim all too well; ‡the evil of Israel is not hidden from me.‡For you have engaged in prostitution, O Ephraim; ‡Israel has defiled itself.
22157	28	5	4	‡Their wicked deeds do not allow them to return to their God;‡for a spirit of idolatry is in them, ‡and they do not acknowledge the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22158	28	5	5	‡The arrogance of Israel testifies against it;‡Israel and Ephraim will be overthrown because of their iniquity.‡Even Judah will be brought down with them.
22159	28	5	6	‡Although they bring their flocks and herds ‡to seek the favor of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡They will not find him – ‡he has withdrawn himself from them!
22160	28	5	7	‡They have committed treason against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡because they bore illegitimate children.‡Soon the new moon festival will devour them and their fields.
22161	28	5	8	‡Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah! ‡Sound the trumpet in Ramah!‡Sound the alarm in Beth Aven! ‡Tremble in fear, O Benjamin!
22162	28	5	9	‡Ephraim will be ruined in the day of judgment! ‡What I am declaring to the tribes of Israel will certainly take place!
22163	28	5	10	‡The princes of Judah are like those who move boundary markers.‡I will pour out my rage on them like a torrential flood!
22164	28	5	11	‡Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed under judgment, ‡because he was determined to pursue worthless idols.
22165	28	5	12	‡I will be like a moth to Ephraim, ‡like wood rot to the house of Judah.
22166	28	5	13	‡When Ephraim saw his sickness ‡and Judah saw his wound,‡then Ephraim turned to Assyria,‡and begged its great king for help.‡But he will not be able to heal you! ‡He cannot cure your wound!
22167	28	5	14	‡I will be like a lion to Ephraim,‡like a young lion to the house of Judah.‡I myself will tear them to pieces,‡then I will carry them off, and no one will be able to rescue them!
22168	28	5	15	‡Then I will return again to my lair ‡until they have suffered their punishment. ‡Then they will seek me; ‡in their distress they will earnestly seek me.
22169	28	6	1	‡“Come on! Let’s return to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!‡He himself has torn us to pieces, ‡but he will heal us!‡He has injured us, ‡but he will bandage our wounds!
22170	28	6	2	‡He will restore us in a very short time; ‡he will heal us in a little while, ‡so that we may live in his presence.
22171	28	6	3	‡So let us search for him! ‡Let us seek to know the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!‡He will come to our rescue as certainly as the appearance of the dawn,‡as certainly as the winter rain comes,‡as certainly as the spring rain that waters the land.”
22172	28	6	4	‡What am I going to do with you, O Ephraim?‡What am I going to do with you, O Judah?‡For your faithfulness is as fleeting as the morning mist; ‡it disappears as quickly as dawn’s dew!
22173	28	6	5	‡Therefore, I will certainly cut you into pieces at the hands of the prophets; ‡I will certainly kill you in fulfillment of my oracles of judgment; ‡for my judgment will come forth like the light of the dawn.
22174	28	6	6	‡For I delight in faithfulness, not simply in sacrifice;‡I delight in acknowledging God, not simply in whole burnt offerings.
22175	28	6	7	‡At Adam they broke the covenant;‡Oh how they were unfaithful to me!
22176	28	6	8	‡Gilead is a city full of evildoers; ‡its streets are stained with bloody footprints!
22177	28	6	9	‡The company of priests is like a gang of robbers,‡lying in ambush to pounce on a victim.‡They commit murder on the road to Shechem;‡they have done heinous crimes!
22178	28	6	10	‡I have seen a disgusting thing in the house of Israel:‡there Ephraim commits prostitution with other gods, ‡and Israel defiles itself.
22179	28	6	11	‡I have appointed a time to reap judgment for you also, O Judah!‡Whenever I want to restore the fortunes of my people,
22180	28	7	1	‡whenever I want to heal Israel,‡the sin of Ephraim is revealed,‡and the evil deeds of Samaria are exposed.‡For they do what is wrong;‡thieves break into houses,‡and gangs rob people out in the streets.
22181	28	7	2	‡They do not realize ‡that I remember all of their wicked deeds.‡Their evil deeds have now surrounded them;‡their sinful deeds are always before me.
22182	28	7	3	‡The royal advisers delight the king with their evil schemes,‡the princes make him glad with their lies.
22183	28	7	4	‡They are all like bakers, ‡they are like a smoldering oven;‡they are like a baker who does not stoke the fire‡until the kneaded dough is ready for baking.
22184	28	7	5	‡At the celebration of their king, ‡his princes become inflamed with wine;‡they conspire with evildoers.
22185	28	7	6	‡They approach him, all the while plotting against him.‡Their hearts are like an oven;‡their anger smolders all night long,‡but in the morning it bursts into a flaming fire.
22186	28	7	7	‡All of them are blazing like an oven;‡they devour their rulers.‡All of their kings fall – ‡and none of them call on me!
22187	28	7	8	‡Ephraim has mixed itself like flour among the nations;‡Ephraim is like a ruined cake of bread that is scorched on one side.
22188	28	7	9	‡Foreigners are consuming what his strenuous labor produced, ‡but he does not recognize it!‡His head is filled with gray hair,‡but he does not realize it!
22189	28	7	10	‡The arrogance of Israel testifies against him,‡yet they refuse to return to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God!‡In spite of all this they refuse to seek him!
22190	28	7	11	‡Ephraim has been like a dove, ‡easily deceived and lacking discernment.‡They called to Egypt for help;‡they turned to Assyria for protection.
22191	28	7	12	‡I will throw my bird net over them while they are flying,‡I will bring them down like birds in the sky;‡I will discipline them when I hear them flocking together.
22192	28	7	13	‡Woe to them! For they have fled from me!‡Destruction to them! For they have rebelled against me!‡I want to deliver them,‡but they have lied to me.
22193	28	7	14	‡They do not pray to me, ‡but howl in distress on their beds;‡They slash themselves for grain and new wine,‡but turn away from me.
22194	28	7	15	‡Although I trained and strengthened them, ‡they plot evil against me!
22195	28	7	16	‡They turn to Baal; ‡they are like an unreliable bow. ‡Their leaders will fall by the sword‡because their prayers to Baal have made me angry.‡So people will disdain them in the land of Egypt.
22196	28	8	1	‡Sound the alarm! ‡An eagle looms over the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!‡For they have broken their covenant with me, ‡and have rebelled against my law.
22197	28	8	2	‡Israel cries out to me,‡“My God, we acknowledge you!”
22198	28	8	3	‡But Israel has rejected what is morally good;‡so an enemy will pursue him.
22199	28	8	4	‡They enthroned kings without my consent! ‡They appointed princes without my approval! ‡They made idols out of their silver and gold,‡but they will be destroyed!
22200	28	8	5	‡O Samaria, he has rejected your calf idol!‡My anger burns against them!‡They will not survive much longer without being punished, ‡even though they are Israelites!
22201	28	8	6	‡That idol was made by a workman – it is not God!‡The calf idol of Samaria will be broken to bits.
22202	28	8	7	‡They sow the wind,‡and so they will reap the whirlwind!‡The stalk does not have any standing grain;‡it will not produce any flour.‡Even if it were to yield grain,‡foreigners would swallow it all up.
22203	28	8	8	‡Israel will be swallowed up among the nations;‡they will be like a worthless piece of pottery.
22204	28	8	9	‡They have gone up to Assyria, ‡like a wild donkey that wanders off.‡Ephraim has hired prostitutes as lovers.
22205	28	8	10	‡Even though they have hired lovers among the nations, ‡I will soon gather them together for judgment. ‡Then they will begin to waste away‡under the oppression of a mighty king.
22206	28	8	11	‡Although Ephraim has built many altars for sin offerings,‡these have become altars for sinning!
22207	28	8	12	‡I spelled out my law for him in great detail,‡but they regard it as something totally unknown to them!
22208	28	8	13	‡They offer up sacrificial gifts to me,‡and eat the meat,‡but the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> does not accept their sacrifices. ‡Soon he will remember their wrongdoing,‡he will punish their sins,‡and they will return to Egypt.
22209	28	8	14	‡Israel has forgotten his Maker and built royal palaces,‡and Judah has built many fortified cities.‡But I will send fire on their cities;‡it will consume their royal citadels.
22210	28	9	1	‡O Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly like the nations,‡for you are unfaithful to your God.‡You love to receive a prostitute’s wages ‡on all the floors where you thresh your grain.
22211	28	9	2	‡Threshing floors and wine vats will not feed the people, ‡and new wine only deceives them.
22212	28	9	3	‡They will not remain in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s land.‡Ephraim will return to Egypt;‡they will eat ritually unclean food in Assyria.
22213	28	9	4	‡They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡they will not please him with their sacrifices.‡Their sacrifices will be like bread eaten while in mourning;‡all those who eat them will make themselves ritually unclean.‡For their bread will be only to satisfy their appetite;‡it will not come into the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22214	28	9	5	‡So what will you do on the festival day,‡on the festival days of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>?
22215	28	9	6	‡Look! Even if they flee from the destruction,‡Egypt will take hold of them,‡and Memphis will bury them.‡The weeds will inherit the silver they treasure – ‡thorn bushes will occupy their homes.
22216	28	9	7	‡The time of judgment is about to arrive! ‡The time of retribution is imminent! ‡Israel will be humbled! ‡The prophet is considered a fool – ‡the inspired man is viewed as a madman – ‡because of the multitude of your sins‡and your intense animosity.
22217	28	9	8	‡The prophet is a watchman over Ephraim on behalf of God, ‡yet traps are laid for him along all of his paths; ‡animosity rages against him in the land of his God.
22218	28	9	9	‡They have sunk deep into corruption ‡as in the days of Gibeah.‡He will remember their wrongdoing.‡He will repay them for their sins.
22219	28	9	10	‡When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the wilderness.‡I viewed your ancestors like an early fig on a fig tree in its first season.‡Then they came to Baal-Peor and they dedicated themselves to shame –‡they became as detestable as what they loved.
22220	28	9	11	‡Ephraim will be like a bird;‡what they value will fly away.‡They will not bear children –‡they will not enjoy pregnancy –‡they will not even conceive!
22221	28	9	12	‡Even if they raise their children, ‡I will take away every last one of them. ‡Woe to them!‡For I will turn away from them.
22222	28	9	13	‡Ephraim, as I have seen, has given their children for prey; ‡Ephraim will bear his sons for slaughter.
22223	28	9	14	‡Give them, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – ‡what will you give them?‡Give them wombs that miscarry,‡and breasts that cannot nurse!
22224	28	9	15	‡Because of all their evil in Gilgal,‡I hate them there.‡On account of their evil deeds,‡I will drive them out of my land. ‡I will no longer love them;‡all their rulers are rebels.
22225	28	9	16	‡Ephraim will be struck down – ‡their root will be dried up;‡they will not yield any fruit.‡Even if they do bear children,‡I will kill their precious offspring.
22226	28	9	17	‡My God will reject them,‡for they have not obeyed him;‡so they will be fugitives among the nations.
22227	28	10	1	‡Israel was a fertile vine‡that yielded fruit.‡As his fruit multiplied,‡he multiplied altars to Baal. ‡As his land prospered,‡they adorned the fertility pillars.
22228	28	10	2	‡Their hearts are slipping;‡soon they will be punished for their guilt.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will break their altars;‡he will completely destroy their fertility pillars.
22229	28	10	3	‡Very soon they will say, “We have no king‡since we did not fear the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡But what can a king do for us anyway?”
22230	28	10	4	‡They utter empty words, ‡taking false oaths and making empty agreements.‡Therefore legal disputes sprout up‡like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a plowed field.
22231	28	10	5	‡The inhabitants of Samaria will lament over the calf idol of Beth Aven. ‡Its people will mourn over it;‡its idolatrous priests will wail over it, ‡because its splendor will be taken from them into exile.
22232	28	10	6	‡Even the calf idol will be carried to Assyria,‡as tribute for the great king. ‡Ephraim will be disgraced;‡Israel will be put to shame because of its wooden idol.
22233	28	10	7	‡Samaria and its king will be carried off ‡like a twig on the surface of the waters.
22234	28	10	8	‡The high places of the “House of Wickedness” will be destroyed;‡it is the place where Israel sins.‡Thorns and thistles will grow up over its altars.‡Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!”‡and to the hills, “Fall on us!”
22235	28	10	9	‡O Israel, you have sinned since the time of Gibeah, ‡and there you have remained.‡Did not war overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?
22236	28	10	10	‡When I please, I will discipline them; ‡I will gather nations together to attack them, ‡to bind them in chains for their two sins.
22237	28	10	11	‡Ephraim was a well-trained heifer who loved to thresh grain;‡I myself put a fine yoke on her neck.‡I will harness Ephraim.‡Let Judah plow! ‡Let Jacob break up the unplowed ground for himself!
22238	28	10	12	‡Sow righteousness for yourselves,‡reap unfailing love.‡Break up the unplowed ground for yourselves,‡for it is time to seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡until he comes and showers deliverance on you.
22239	28	10	13	‡But you have plowed wickedness;‡you have reaped injustice;‡you have eaten the fruit of deception.‡Because you have depended on your chariots; ‡you have relied on your many warriors.
22240	28	10	14	‡The roar of battle will rise against your people;‡all your fortresses will be devastated,‡just as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle,‡when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children.
22241	28	10	15	‡So will it happen to you, O Bethel, ‡because of your great wickedness!‡When that day dawns, ‡the king of Israel will be destroyed.
22242	28	11	1	‡When Israel was a young man, I loved him like a son, ‡and I summoned my son out of Egypt.
22243	28	11	2	‡But the more I summoned them,‡the farther they departed from me. ‡They sacrificed to the Baal idols‡and burned incense to images.
22244	28	11	3	‡Yet it was I who led Ephraim,‡I took them by the arm;‡but they did not acknowledge ‡that I had healed them.
22245	28	11	4	‡I led them with leather cords,‡with leather ropes;‡I lifted the yoke from their neck, ‡and gently fed them.
22246	28	11	5	‡They will return to Egypt! ‡Assyria will rule over them ‡because they refuse to repent!
22247	28	11	6	‡A sword will flash in their cities,‡it will destroy the bars of their city gates,‡and will devour them in their fortresses.
22248	28	11	7	‡My people are obsessed with turning away from me; ‡they call to Baal, but he will never exalt them!
22249	28	11	8	‡How can I give you up, O Ephraim?‡How can I surrender you, O Israel?‡How can I treat you like Admah?‡How can I make you like Zeboiim?‡I have had a change of heart! ‡All my tender compassions are aroused!
22250	28	11	9	‡I cannot carry out my fierce anger!‡I cannot totally destroy Ephraim!‡Because I am God, and not man – the Holy One among you – ‡I will not come in wrath!
22251	28	11	10	‡He will roar like a lion, ‡and they will follow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡when he roars, ‡his children will come trembling from the west.
22252	28	11	11	‡They will return in fear and trembling ‡like birds from Egypt,‡like doves from Assyria,‡and I will settle them in their homes,” declares the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22253	28	11	12	‡(12:1) Ephraim has surrounded me with lies;‡the house of Israel has surrounded me with deceit.‡But Judah still roams about with God;‡he remains faithful to the Holy One.
22254	28	12	1	‡Ephraim continually feeds on the wind;‡he chases the east wind all day;‡he multiplies lies and violence.‡They make treaties with Assyria,‡and send olive oil as tribute to Egypt.
22255	28	12	2	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> also has a covenant lawsuit against Judah;‡he will punish Jacob according to his ways‡and repay him according to his deeds.
22256	28	12	3	‡In the womb he attacked his brother;‡in his manly vigor he struggled with God.
22257	28	12	4	‡He struggled with an angel and prevailed;‡he wept and begged for his favor.‡He found God at Bethel, ‡and there he spoke with him!
22258	28	12	5	‡As for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God Almighty,‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is the name by which he is remembered!
22259	28	12	6	‡But you must return to your God,‡by maintaining love and justice,‡and by waiting for your God to return to you.
22260	28	12	7	‡The businessmen love to cheat; ‡they use dishonest scales.
22261	28	12	8	‡Ephraim boasts, “I am very rich! ‡I have become wealthy! ‡In all that I have done to gain my wealth, ‡no one can accuse me of any offense that is actually sinful.”
22262	28	12	9	‡“I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God who brought you out of Egypt;‡I will make you live in tents again as in the days of old.
22263	28	12	10	‡I spoke to the prophets;‡I myself revealed many visions; ‡I spoke in parables through the prophets.”
22264	28	12	11	‡Is there idolatry in Gilead? ‡Certainly its inhabitants will come to nothing! ‡Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal?‡Surely their altars will be like stones heaped up on a plowed field!
22265	28	12	12	‡Jacob fled to the country of Aram,‡then Israel worked to acquire a wife;‡he tended sheep to pay for her.
22266	28	12	13	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> brought Israel out of Egypt by a prophet,‡and due to a prophet Israel was preserved alive.
22267	28	12	14	‡But Ephraim bitterly provoked him to anger;‡so he will hold him accountable for the blood he has shed, ‡his Lord will repay him for the contempt he has shown.
22268	28	13	1	‡When Ephraim spoke, there was terror; ‡he was exalted in Israel,‡but he became guilty by worshiping Baal and died.
22269	28	13	2	‡Even now they persist in sin! ‡They make metal images for themselves,‡idols that they skillfully fashion from their own silver;‡all of them are nothing but the work of craftsmen!‡There is a saying about them: ‡“Those who sacrifice to the calf idol are calf kissers!”
22270	28	13	3	‡Therefore they will disappear like the morning mist, ‡like early morning dew that evaporates, ‡like chaff that is blown away from a threshing floor,‡like smoke that disappears through an open window.
22271	28	13	4	‡But I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,‡who brought you out of Egypt.‡Therefore, you must not acknowledge any God but me;‡except me there is no Savior.
22272	28	13	5	‡I cared for you in the wilderness,‡in the dry desert where no water was.
22273	28	13	6	‡When they were fed, they became satisfied;‡when they were satisfied, they became proud; ‡as a result, they forgot me!
22274	28	13	7	‡So I will pounce on them like a lion; ‡like a leopard I will lurk by the path.
22275	28	13	8	‡I will attack them like a bear robbed of her cubs – ‡I will rip open their chests.‡I will devour them there like a lion – ‡like a wild animal would tear them apart.
22276	28	13	9	‡I will destroy you, O Israel!‡Who is there to help you?
22277	28	13	10	‡Where then is your king, ‡that he may save you in all your cities?‡Where are your rulers for whom you asked, saying,‡“Give me a king and princes”?
22278	28	13	11	‡I granted you a king in my anger,‡and I will take him away in my wrath!
22279	28	13	12	‡The punishment of Ephraim has been decreed; ‡his punishment is being stored up for the future.
22280	28	13	13	‡The labor pains of a woman will overtake him,‡but the baby will lack wisdom;‡when the time arrives,‡he will not come out of the womb!
22281	28	13	14	‡Will I deliver them from the power of Sheol? No, I will not! ‡Will I redeem them from death? No, I will not!‡O Death, bring on your plagues! ‡O Sheol, bring on your destruction! ‡My eyes will not show any compassion!
22282	28	13	15	‡Even though he flourishes like a reed plant, ‡a scorching east wind will come,‡a wind from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rising up from the desert.‡As a result, his spring will dry up; ‡his well will become dry.‡That wind will spoil all his delightful foods‡in the containers in his storehouse.
22283	28	13	16	‡(14:1) Samaria will be held guilty, ‡because she rebelled against her God.‡They will fall by the sword,‡their infants will be dashed to the ground – ‡their pregnant women will be ripped open.
22284	28	14	1	‡Return, O Israel, to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,‡for your sin has been your downfall!
22285	28	14	2	‡Return to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and repent! ‡Say to him: “Completely forgive our iniquity;‡accept our penitential prayer, ‡that we may offer the praise of our lips as sacrificial bulls.
22286	28	14	3	‡Assyria cannot save us;‡we will not ride warhorses.‡We will never again say, ‘Our gods’‡to what our own hands have made.‡For only you will show compassion to Orphan Israel!”

22291	28	14	8	‡O Ephraim, I do not want to have anything to do with idols anymore!‡I will answer him and care for him.‡I am like a luxuriant cypress tree; ‡your fruitfulness comes from me!
22292	28	14	9	‡Who is wise? ‡Let him discern these things!‡Who is discerning? ‡Let him understand them!‡For the ways of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> are right;‡the godly walk in them,¶but in them the rebellious stumble.
22293	29	1	1	‡This is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message that came to Joel the son of Pethuel:
22294	29	1	2	‡Listen to this, you elders; ‡pay attention, all inhabitants of the land.‡Has anything like this ever happened in your whole life ‡or in the lifetime of your ancestors?
22295	29	1	3	‡Tell your children about it,‡have your children tell their children,‡and their children the following generation.
22296	29	1	4	‡What the <i>gazam</i>-locust left the <i>‘arbeh</i>-locust consumed, ‡what the <i>‘arbeh</i>-locust left the <i>yeleq</i>-locust consumed,‡and what the <i>yeleq</i>-locust left the <i>hasil</i>-locust consumed!
22297	29	1	5	‡Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!‡Wail, all you wine drinkers, ‡because the sweet wine has been taken away from you.
22298	29	1	6	‡For a nation has invaded my land,‡mighty and without number.‡Their teeth are lion’s teeth;‡they have the fangs of a lioness.
22299	29	1	7	‡They have destroyed my vines; ‡they have turned my fig trees into mere splinters.‡They have completely stripped off the bark and thrown it aside;‡the twigs are stripped bare.
22300	29	1	8	‡Wail like a young virgin clothed in sackcloth,‡lamenting the death of her husband-to-be.
22301	29	1	9	‡No one brings grain offerings or drink offerings ‡to the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> anymore. ‡So the priests, those who serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, are in mourning.
22302	29	1	10	‡The crops of the fields have been destroyed. ‡The ground is in mourning because the grain has perished.‡The fresh wine has dried up;‡the olive oil languishes.
22303	29	1	11	‡Be distressed, farmers;‡wail, vinedressers, over the wheat and the barley.‡For the harvest of the field has perished.

22305	29	1	13	‡Get dressed and lament, you priests!‡Wail, you who minister at the altar!‡Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you servants of my God,‡because no one brings grain offerings or drink offerings ‡to the temple of your God anymore.
22306	29	1	14	‡Announce a holy fast; ‡proclaim a sacred assembly.‡Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land‡to the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,‡and cry out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.

22315	29	2	3	‡Like fire they devour everything in their path; ‡a flame blazes behind them. ‡The land looks like the Garden of Eden before them,‡but behind them there is only a desolate wilderness – ‡for nothing escapes them!
22316	29	2	4	‡They look like horses; ‡they charge ahead like war horses.
22317	29	2	5	‡They sound like chariots rumbling over mountain tops,‡like the crackling of blazing fire consuming stubble,‡like the noise of a mighty army being drawn up for battle.
22318	29	2	6	‡People writhe in fear when they see them. ‡All of their faces turn pale with fright.
22319	29	2	7	‡They charge like warriors;‡they scale walls like soldiers. ‡Each one proceeds on his course;‡they do not alter their path.
22320	29	2	8	‡They do not jostle one another; ‡each of them marches straight ahead. ‡They burst through the city defenses ‡and do not break ranks.
22321	29	2	9	‡They rush into the city;‡they scale its walls.‡They climb up into the houses;‡they go in through the windows like a thief.
22322	29	2	10	‡The earth quakes before them; ‡the sky reverberates. ‡The sun and the moon grow dark; ‡the stars refuse to shine.
22323	29	2	11	‡The voice of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> thunders as he leads his army. ‡Indeed, his warriors are innumerable; ‡Surely his command is carried out! ‡Yes, the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is awesome ‡and very terrifying – who can survive it?
22324	29	2	12	‡“Yet even now,” the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“return to me with all your heart – ‡with fasting, weeping, and mourning.
22325	29	2	13	‡Tear your hearts, ‡not just your garments!”‡Return to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,‡for he is merciful and compassionate, ‡slow to anger and boundless in loyal love – often relenting from calamitous punishment.
22326	29	2	14	‡Who knows? ‡Perhaps he will be compassionate and grant a reprieve, ‡and leave blessing in his wake – ‡a meal offering and a drink offering for you to offer to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God!
22327	29	2	15	‡Blow the trumpet in Zion.‡Announce a holy fast;‡proclaim a sacred assembly!
22328	29	2	16	‡Gather the people;‡sanctify an assembly!‡Gather the elders;‡gather the children and the nursing infants.‡Let the bridegroom come out from his bedroom‡and the bride from her private quarters.
22329	29	2	17	‡Let the priests, those who serve the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, weep‡from the vestibule all the way back to the altar. ‡Let them say, “Have pity, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, on your people;‡please do not turn over your inheritance to be mocked,‡to become a proverb among the nations.‡Why should it be said among the peoples,‡“Where is their God?”
22330	29	2	18	‡Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> became zealous for his land;‡he had compassion on his people.
22331	29	2	19	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responded to his people,‡“Look! I am about to restore your grain ‡as well as fresh wine and olive oil.‡You will be fully satisfied. ‡I will never again make you an object of mockery among the nations.
22332	29	2	20	‡I will remove the one from the north far from you.‡I will drive him out to a dry and desolate place.‡Those in front will be driven eastward into the Dead Sea, ‡and those in back westward into the Mediterranean Sea. ‡His stench will rise up as a foul smell.” ‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has accomplished great things.
22333	29	2	21	‡Do not fear, my land!‡Rejoice and be glad,‡because the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has accomplished great things!
22334	29	2	22	‡Do not fear, wild animals! ‡For the pastures of the wilderness are again green with grass.‡Indeed, the trees bear their fruit;‡the fig tree and the vine yield to their fullest.
22335	29	2	23	‡Citizens of Zion, rejoice! ‡Be glad because of what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God has done! ‡For he has given to you the early rains as vindication.‡He has sent to you the rains – ‡both the early and the late rains as formerly.
22336	29	2	24	‡The threshing floors are full of grain;‡the vats overflow with fresh wine and olive oil.
22337	29	2	25	‡I will make up for the years ‡that the <i>‘arbeh</i>-locust consumed your crops – ‡the <i>yeleq</i>-locust, the <i>hasil</i>-locust, and the <i>gazam</i>-locust – ‡my great army that I sent against you.
22338	29	2	26	‡You will have plenty to eat, ‡and your hunger will be fully satisfied; ‡you will praise the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God,‡who has acted wondrously in your behalf.‡My people will never again be put to shame.
22339	29	2	27	‡You will be convinced that I am in the midst of Israel.‡I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God; there is no other.‡My people will never again be put to shame.
22340	29	2	28	‡(3:1) After all of this ‡I will pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people. ‡Your sons and daughters will prophesy.‡Your elderly will have prophetic dreams; ‡your young men will see visions.
22341	29	2	29	‡Even on male and female servants‡I will pour out my Spirit in those days.
22342	29	2	30	‡I will produce portents both in the sky and on the earth – ‡blood, fire, and columns of smoke.
22343	29	2	31	‡The sunlight will be turned to darkness‡and the moon to the color of blood, ‡before the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> comes – ‡that great and terrible day!
22344	29	2	32	‡It will so happen that ‡everyone who calls on the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be delivered. ‡For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who survive, ‡just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has promised;‡the remnant will be those whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will call.
22345	29	3	1	‡(4:1) For look! In those days and at that time‡I will return the exiles to Judah and Jerusalem.
22346	29	3	2	‡Then I will gather all the nations,‡and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat. ‡I will enter into judgment against them there‡concerning my people Israel who are my inheritance, ‡whom they scattered among the nations.‡They partitioned my land,
22347	29	3	3	‡and they cast lots for my people.‡They traded a boy for a prostitute;‡they sold a little girl for wine so they could drink.
22348	29	3	4	‡Why are you doing these things to me, Tyre and Sidon? ‡Are you trying to get even with me, land of Philistia? ‡If you are, I will very quickly repay you for what you have done!
22349	29	3	5	‡For you took my silver and my gold‡and brought my precious valuables to your own palaces.
22350	29	3	6	‡You sold Judeans and Jerusalemites to the Greeks,‡removing them far from their own country.
22351	29	3	7	‡Look! I am rousing them from that place to which you sold them.‡I will repay you for what you have done!
22352	29	3	8	‡I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah. ‡They will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken!
22353	29	3	9	‡Proclaim this among the nations:‡“Prepare for a holy war!‡Call out the warriors!‡Let all these fighting men approach and attack!
22354	29	3	10	‡Beat your plowshares into swords,‡and your pruning hooks into spears! ‡Let the weak say, ‘I too am a warrior!’
22355	29	3	11	‡Lend your aid and come,‡all you surrounding nations,‡and gather yourselves to that place.”‡Bring down, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, your warriors!
22356	29	3	12	‡Let the nations be roused and let them go up‡to the valley of Jehoshaphat,‡for there I will sit in judgment on all the surrounding nations.
22357	29	3	13	‡Rush forth with the sickle, for the harvest is ripe!‡Come, stomp the grapes, for the winepress is full!‡The vats overflow.‡Indeed, their evil is great!
22358	29	3	14	‡Crowds, great crowds are in the valley of decision,‡for the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is near in the valley of decision!
22359	29	3	15	‡The sun and moon are darkened;‡the stars withhold their brightness.
22360	29	3	16	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> roars from Zion;‡from Jerusalem his voice bellows out. ‡The heavens and the earth shake.‡But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is a refuge for his people;‡he is a stronghold for the citizens of Israel.
22361	29	3	17	‡You will be convinced that I the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> am your God,‡dwelling on Zion, my holy mountain.‡Jerusalem will be holy – ‡conquering armies will no longer pass through it.
22362	29	3	18	‡On that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine, ‡and the hills will flow with milk. ‡All the dry stream beds of Judah will flow with water.‡A spring will flow out from the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡watering the Valley of Acacia Trees.
22363	29	3	19	‡Egypt will be desolate‡and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,‡because of the violence they did to the people of Judah, ‡in whose land they shed innocent blood.
22364	29	3	20	‡But Judah will reside securely forever,‡and Jerusalem will be secure from one generation to the next.
22365	29	3	21	‡I will avenge their blood which I had not previously acquitted.¶It is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who dwells in Zion!
22366	30	1	1	¶The following is a record of what Amos prophesied. He was one of the herdsmen from Tekoa. These prophecies about Israel were revealed to him during the time of King Uzziah of Judah and King Jeroboam son of Joash of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
22367	30	1	2	‡Amos said:‡“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> comes roaring out of Zion;‡from Jerusalem he comes bellowing! ‡The shepherds’ pastures wilt; ‡the summit of Carmel withers.”
22368	30	1	3	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Because Damascus has committed three crimes – ‡make that four! – I will not revoke my ‡decree of judgment. ‡They ripped through Gilead like threshing sledges with iron teeth.
22369	30	1	4	‡So I will set Hazael’s house on fire;‡fire will consume Ben Hadad’s fortresses.
22370	30	1	5	‡I will break the bar on the gate of Damascus.‡I will remove the ruler from Wicked Valley, ‡the one who holds the royal scepter from Beth Eden. ‡The people of Aram will be deported to Kir.” ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken!
22371	30	1	6	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Because Gaza has committed three crimes – ‡make that four! – I will not revoke my decree of judgment. ‡They deported a whole community and sold them to Edom.
22372	30	1	7	‡So I will set Gaza’s city wall on fire;‡fire will consume her fortresses.
22373	30	1	8	‡I will remove the ruler from Ashdod, ‡the one who holds the royal scepter from Ashkelon. ‡I will strike Ekron with my hand; ‡the rest of the Philistines will also die.” ‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken!
22374	30	1	9	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Because Tyre has committed three crimes – ‡make that four! – I will not revoke my decree of judgment. ‡They sold a whole community to Edom;‡they failed to observe a treaty of brotherhood.
22375	30	1	10	‡So I will set fire to Tyre’s city wall; ‡fire will consume her fortresses.”
22376	30	1	11	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Because Edom has committed three crimes – ‡make that four! – I will not revoke my decree of judgment. ‡He chased his brother with a sword;‡he wiped out his allies. ‡In his anger he tore them apart without stopping to rest; ‡in his fury he relentlessly attacked them.
22377	30	1	12	‡So I will set Teman on fire;‡fire will consume Bozrah’s fortresses.”
22378	30	1	13	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Because the Ammonites have committed three crimes – ‡make that four! – I will not revoke my decree of judgment. ‡They ripped open Gilead’s pregnant women ‡so they could expand their territory.
22379	30	1	14	‡So I will set fire to Rabbah’s city wall; ‡fire will consume her fortresses.‡War cries will be heard on the day of battle; ‡a strong gale will blow on the day of the windstorm.
22380	30	1	15	‡Ammon’s king will be deported; ‡he and his officials will be carried off together.”‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken!
22381	30	2	1	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Because Moab has committed three crimes – ‡make that four! – I will not revoke my decree of judgment. ‡They burned the bones of Edom’s king into lime.
22382	30	2	2	‡So I will set Moab on fire, ‡and it will consume Kerioth’s fortresses.‡Moab will perish in the heat of battle ‡amid war cries and the blaring of the ram’s horn.
22383	30	2	3	‡I will remove Moab’s leader; ‡I will kill all Moab’s officials with him.”‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken!
22384	30	2	4	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Because Judah has committed three covenant transgressions – ‡make that four! – I will not revoke my decree of judgment. ‡They rejected the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s law; ‡they did not obey his commands.‡Their false gods, ‡to which their fathers were loyal, ‡led them astray.
22385	30	2	5	‡So I will set Judah on fire,‡and it will consume Jerusalem’s fortresses.”
22386	30	2	6	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Because Israel has committed three covenant transgressions – ‡make that four! – I will not revoke my decree of judgment. ‡They sold the innocent for silver, ‡the needy for a pair of sandals.
22387	30	2	7	‡They trample on the dirt-covered heads of the poor; ‡they push the destitute away. ‡A man and his father go to the same girl; ‡in this way they show disrespect for my moral purity.
22388	30	2	8	‡They stretch out on clothing seized as collateral; ‡they do so right beside every altar!‡They drink wine bought with the fines they have levied;‡they do so right in the temple of their God!
22389	30	2	9	‡For Israel’s sake I destroyed the Amorites. ‡They were as tall as cedars ‡and as strong as oaks,‡but I destroyed the fruit on their branches ‡and their roots in the ground.
22390	30	2	10	‡I brought you up from the land of Egypt;‡I led you through the wilderness for forty years‡so you could take the Amorites’ land as your own.
22391	30	2	11	‡I made some of your sons prophets‡and some of your young men Nazirites. ‡Is this not true, you Israelites?”‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking!
22392	30	2	12	‡“But you made the Nazirites drink wine; ‡you commanded the prophets, ‘Do not prophesy!’
22393	30	2	13	‡Look! I will press you down,‡like a cart loaded down with grain presses down.
22394	30	2	14	‡Fast runners will find no place to hide; ‡strong men will have no strength left; ‡warriors will not be able to save their lives.
22395	30	2	15	‡Archers will not hold their ground; ‡fast runners will not save their lives,‡nor will those who ride horses.
22396	30	2	16	‡Bravehearted warriors will run away naked in that day.”‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking!
22397	30	3	1	‡Listen, you Israelites, to this message which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is proclaiming against you! This message is for the entire clan I brought up from the land of Egypt:
22398	30	3	2	“I have chosen you alone from all the clans of the earth. Therefore I will punish you for all your sins.”
22399	30	3	3	‡Do two walk together without having met?
22400	30	3	4	‡Does a lion roar in the woods if he has not cornered his prey? ‡Does a young lion bellow from his den if he has not caught something?
22401	30	3	5	‡Does a bird swoop down into a trap on the ground if there is no bait?‡Does a trap spring up from the ground unless it has surely caught something?
22402	30	3	6	‡If an alarm sounds in a city, do people not fear? ‡If disaster overtakes a city, is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> not responsible?
22403	30	3	7	‡Certainly the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> does nothing without first revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.
22404	30	3	8	‡A lion has roared! Who is not afraid?‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken! Who can refuse to prophesy?
22405	30	3	9	‡Make this announcement in the fortresses of Ashdod‡and in the fortresses in the land of Egypt.‡Say this:‡“Gather on the hills around Samaria! ‡Observe the many acts of violence taking place within the city, ‡the oppressive deeds occurring in it.”
22406	30	3	10	‡“They do not know how to do what is right.” (The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking.)‡“They store up the spoils of destructive violence in their fortresses.
22407	30	3	11	‡Therefore,” says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “an enemy will encircle the land. ‡He will take away your power; ‡your fortresses will be looted.”
22408	30	3	12	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Just as a shepherd salvages from the lion’s mouth a couple of leg bones or a piece of an ear,‡so the Israelites who live in Samaria will be salvaged. ‡They will be left with just a corner of a bed, ‡and a part of a couch.”
22409	30	3	13	‡Listen and warn the family of Jacob! ‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God who commands armies, is speaking!
22410	30	3	14	‡“Certainly when I punish Israel for their covenant transgressions, ‡I will destroy Bethel’s altars.‡The horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.
22411	30	3	15	‡I will destroy both the winter and summer houses. ‡The houses filled with ivory will be ruined,‡the great houses will be swept away.” ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking!
22412	30	4	1	‡Listen to this message, you cows of Bashan who live on Mount Samaria!‡You oppress the poor;‡you crush the needy.‡You say to your husbands,‡“Bring us more to drink!”
22413	30	4	2	‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> confirms this oath by his own holy character: ‡“Certainly the time is approaching ‡when you will be carried away in baskets, ‡every last one of you in fishermen’s pots.
22414	30	4	3	‡Each of you will go straight through the gaps in the walls; ‡you will be thrown out toward Harmon.” ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking!
22415	30	4	4	‡“Go to Bethel and rebel! ‡At Gilgal rebel some more!‡Bring your sacrifices in the morning,‡your tithes on the third day!
22416	30	4	5	‡Burn a thank offering of bread made with yeast! ‡Make a public display of your voluntary offerings! ‡For you love to do this, you Israelites.”‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking!
22417	30	4	6	‡“But surely I gave you no food to eat in all your cities;‡you lacked food everywhere you live. ‡Still you did not come back to me.”‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking!
22418	30	4	7	‡“I withheld rain from you three months before the harvest. ‡I gave rain to one city, but not to another. ‡One field would get rain, but the field that received no rain dried up.
22419	30	4	8	‡People from two or three cities staggered into one city to get water, ‡but remained thirsty. ‡Still you did not come back to me.” ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking!
22420	30	4	9	‡“I destroyed your crops with blight and disease. ‡Locusts kept devouring your orchards, vineyards, fig trees, and olive trees. ‡Still you did not come back to me.” ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking!
22421	30	4	10	‡“I sent against you a plague like one of the Egyptian plagues. ‡I killed your young men with the sword, ‡along with the horses you had captured. ‡I made the stench from the corpses rise up into your nostrils. ‡Still you did not come back to me.” ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking!
22422	30	4	11	‡“I overthrew some of you the way God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. ‡You were like a burning stick snatched from the flames. ‡Still you did not come back to me.” ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking!
22423	30	4	12	‡“Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel. ‡Because I will do this to you, ‡prepare to meet your God, Israel!
22424	30	4	13	‡For here he is! ‡He formed the mountains and created the wind. ‡He reveals his plans to men. ‡He turns the dawn into darkness ‡and marches on the heights of the earth. ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, is his name!”
22425	30	5	1	‡Listen to this funeral song I am ready to sing about you, family of Israel:
22426	30	5	2	‡“The virgin Israel has fallen down and will not get up again.‡She is abandoned on her own land ‡with no one to help her get up.”
22427	30	5	3	‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says this:‡“The city that marches out with a thousand soldiers will have only a hundred left;‡the town that marches out with a hundred soldiers will have only ten left for the family of Israel.”
22428	30	5	4	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says this to the family of Israel:‡“Seek me so you can live!
22429	30	5	5	‡Do not seek Bethel! ‡Do not visit Gilgal!‡Do not journey down to Beer Sheba!‡For the people of Gilgal will certainly be carried into exile; ‡and Bethel will become a place where disaster abounds.”
22430	30	5	6	‡Seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> so you can live!‡Otherwise he will break out like fire against Joseph’s family; ‡the fire will consume ‡and no one will be able to quench it and save Bethel.
22431	30	5	7	‡The Israelites turn justice into bitterness; ‡they throw what is fair and right to the ground.
22432	30	5	8	‡(But there is one who made the constellations Pleiades and Orion;‡he can turn the darkness into morning‡and daylight into night.‡He summons the water of the seas‡and pours it out on the earth’s surface.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is his name!
22433	30	5	9	‡He flashes destruction down upon the strong ‡so that destruction overwhelms the fortified places.)
22434	30	5	10	‡The Israelites hate anyone who arbitrates at the city gate; ‡they despise anyone who speaks honestly.
22435	30	5	11	‡Therefore, because you make the poor pay taxes on their crops ‡and exact a grain tax from them,‡you will not live in the houses you built with chiseled stone,‡nor will you drink the wine from the fine vineyards you planted.
22436	30	5	12	‡Certainly I am aware of your many rebellious acts ‡and your numerous sins.‡You torment the innocent, you take bribes,‡and you deny justice to the needy at the city gate.
22437	30	5	13	‡For this reason whoever is smart keeps quiet in such a time,‡for it is an evil time.
22438	30	5	14	‡Seek good and not evil so you can live!‡Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, just might be with you, ‡as you claim he is.
22439	30	5	15	‡Hate what is wrong, love what is right!‡Promote justice at the city gate! ‡Maybe the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, will have mercy on those who are left from Joseph.
22440	30	5	16	‡Because of Israel’s sins this is what the Lord, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, says:‡“In all the squares there will be wailing,‡in all the streets they will mourn the dead. ‡They will tell the field workers to lament‡and the professional mourners to wail.

22442	30	5	18	‡Woe to those who wish for the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!‡Why do you want the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s day of judgment to come?‡It will bring darkness, not light.
22443	30	5	19	‡Disaster will be inescapable, ‡as if a man ran from a lion only to meet a bear, ‡then escaped into a house, ‡leaned his hand against the wall, ‡and was bitten by a poisonous snake.
22444	30	5	20	‡Don’t you realize the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s day of judgment will bring darkness, not light – ‡gloomy blackness, not bright light?
22445	30	5	21	‡“I absolutely despise your festivals!‡I get no pleasure from your religious assemblies!
22446	30	5	22	‡Even if you offer me burnt and grain offerings, I will not be satisfied;‡I will not look with favor on your peace offerings of fattened calves.
22447	30	5	23	‡Take away from me your noisy songs;‡I don’t want to hear the music of your stringed instruments.
22448	30	5	24	‡Justice must flow like torrents of water,‡righteous actions like a stream that never dries up.
22449	30	5	25	‡You did not bring me sacrifices and grain offerings during the forty years you spent in the wilderness, family of Israel.
22450	30	5	26	‡You will pick up your images of Sikkuth, your king, ‡and Kiyyun, your star god, which you made for yourselves,
22451	30	5	27	‡and I will drive you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡He is called the God of Heaven’s Armies!
22452	30	6	1	‡Woe to those who live in ease in Zion, ‡to those who feel secure on Mount Samaria.‡They think of themselves as the elite class of the best nation.‡The family of Israel looks to them for leadership.
22453	30	6	2	‡They say to the people: ‡“Journey over to Calneh and look at it!‡Then go from there to Hamath-Rabbah! ‡Then go down to Gath of the Philistines!‡Are they superior to our two kingdoms?‡Is their territory larger than yours?”
22454	30	6	3	‡You refuse to believe a day of disaster will come, ‡but you establish a reign of violence.
22455	30	6	4	‡They lie around on beds decorated with ivory, ‡and sprawl out on their couches.‡They eat lambs from the flock,‡and calves from the middle of the pen.
22456	30	6	5	‡They sing to the tune of stringed instruments; ‡like David they invent musical instruments.
22457	30	6	6	‡They drink wine from sacrificial bowls, ‡and pour the very best oils on themselves. ‡Yet they are not concerned over the ruin of Joseph.
22458	30	6	7	‡Therefore they will now be the first to go into exile, ‡and the religious banquets where they sprawl on couches will end.
22459	30	6	8	‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> confirms this oath by his very own life. ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies, is speaking:‡“I despise Jacob’s arrogance;‡I hate their fortresses.‡I will hand over to their enemies the city of Samaria and everything in it.”
22460	30	6	9	‡If ten men are left in one house, they too will die.
22461	30	6	10	When their close relatives, the ones who will burn the corpses, pick up their bodies to remove the bones from the house, they will say to anyone who is in the inner rooms of the house, “Is anyone else with you?” He will respond, “No one.” Then he will say, “Hush! Don’t invoke the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s name!”
22462	30	6	11	‡Indeed, look! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is giving the command. ‡He will smash the large house to bits,‡and the small house into little pieces.
22463	30	6	12	‡Can horses run on rocky cliffs?‡Can one plow the sea with oxen? ‡Yet you have turned justice into a poisonous plant,‡and the fruit of righteous actions into a bitter plant.
22464	30	6	13	‡You are happy because you conquered Lo-Debar. ‡You say, “Did we not conquer Karnaim by our own power?”
22465	30	6	14	‡“Look! I am about to bring a nation against you, family of Israel.”‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God who commands armies, is speaking.‡“They will oppress you all the way from Lebo Hamath to the stream of the rift valley.”
22466	30	7	1	¶The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> showed me this: I saw him making locusts just as the crops planted late were beginning to sprout. (The crops planted late sprout after the royal harvest.)
22467	30	7	2	When they had completely consumed the earth’s vegetation, I said, ‡“Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, forgive Israel! ‡How can Jacob survive? ‡He is too weak!”
22468	30	7	3	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> decided not to do this. “It will not happen,” the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said.
22469	30	7	4	¶The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> showed me this: I saw the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> summoning a shower of fire. It consumed the great deep and devoured the fields.
22470	30	7	5	‡I said, “Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, stop! ‡How can Jacob survive? ‡He is too weak!”
22471	30	7	6	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> decided not to do this. The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “This will not happen either.”
22472	30	7	7	¶He showed me this: I saw the Lord standing by a tin wall holding tin in his hand.
22473	30	7	8	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “What do you see, Amos?” I said, “Tin.” The Lord then said,‡“Look, I am about to place tin among my people Israel. ‡I will no longer overlook their sin.
22474	30	7	9	‡Isaac’s centers of worship will become desolate;‡Israel’s holy places will be in ruins.‡I will attack Jeroboam’s dynasty with the sword.”
22475	30	7	10	¶Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent this message to King Jeroboam of Israel: “Amos is conspiring against you in the very heart of the kingdom of Israel! The land cannot endure all his prophecies.
22476	30	7	11	As a matter of fact, Amos is saying this: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly be carried into exile away from its land.’”
22477	30	7	12	¶Amaziah then said to Amos, “Leave, you visionary! Run away to the land of Judah! Earn your living and prophesy there!
22478	30	7	13	Don’t prophesy at Bethel any longer, for a royal temple and palace are here!”
22479	30	7	14	¶Amos replied to Amaziah, “I was not a prophet by profession. No, I was a herdsman who also took care of sycamore fig trees.
22480	30	7	15	Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> took me from tending flocks and gave me this commission, ‘Go! Prophesy to my people Israel!’
22481	30	7	16	So now listen to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message! You say, ‘Don’t prophesy against Israel! Don’t preach against the family of Isaac!’
22482	30	7	17	‡“Therefore this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the streets ‡and your sons and daughters will die violently. ‡Your land will be given to others ‡and you will die in a foreign land.‡Israel will certainly be carried into exile away from its land.’”
22483	30	8	1	‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> showed me this: I saw a basket of summer fruit.
22484	30	8	2	¶He said, “What do you see, Amos?” I replied, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “The end has come for my people Israel! I will no longer overlook their sins.
22485	30	8	3	‡The women singing in the temple will wail in that day.” ‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is speaking. ‡“There will be many corpses littered everywhere! Be quiet!”
22486	30	8	4	‡Listen to this, you who trample the needy,‡and do away with the destitute in the land.
22487	30	8	5	‡You say, ‡“When will the new moon festival be over, so we can sell grain? ‡When will the Sabbath end, so we can open up the grain bins? ‡We’re eager to sell less for a higher price, ‡and to cheat the buyer with rigged scales!
22488	30	8	6	‡We’re eager to trade silver for the poor, ‡a pair of sandals for the needy!‡We want to mix in some chaff with the grain!”
22489	30	8	7	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> confirms this oath by the arrogance of Jacob: ‡“I swear I will never forget all you have done!
22490	30	8	8	‡Because of this the earth will quake, ‡and all who live in it will mourn.‡The whole earth will rise like the River Nile, ‡it will surge upward and then grow calm, like the Nile in Egypt.
22491	30	8	9	‡In that day,” says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “I will make the sun set at noon,‡and make the earth dark in the middle of the day.
22492	30	8	10	‡I will turn your festivals into funerals, ‡and all your songs into funeral dirges.‡I will make everyone wear funeral clothes ‡and cause every head to be shaved bald. ‡I will make you mourn as if you had lost your only son; ‡when it ends it will indeed have been a bitter day.
22493	30	8	11	‡Be certain of this, the time is coming,” says the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡“when I will send a famine through the land – ‡not a shortage of food or water‡but an end to divine revelation!
22494	30	8	12	‡People will stagger from sea to sea, ‡and from the north around to the east. ‡They will wander about looking for a message from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡but they will not find any.
22495	30	8	13	‡In that day your beautiful young women and your young men will faint from thirst.
22496	30	8	14	‡These are the ones who now take oaths in the name of the sinful idol goddess of Samaria. ‡They vow, ‘As surely as your god lives, O Dan,’ or ‘As surely as your beloved one lives, O Beer Sheba!’ ‡But they will fall down and not get up again.”
22497	30	9	1	‡I saw the Lord standing by the altar and he said, “Strike the tops of the support pillars, so the thresholds shake!‡Knock them down on the heads of all the people, ‡and I will kill the survivors with the sword.‡No one will be able to run away; ‡no one will be able to escape.
22498	30	9	2	‡Even if they could dig down into the netherworld, ‡my hand would pull them up from there.‡Even if they could climb up to heaven,‡I would drag them down from there.
22499	30	9	3	‡Even if they were to hide on the top of Mount Carmel,‡I would hunt them down and take them from there.‡Even if they tried to hide from me at the bottom of the sea,‡from there I would command the Sea Serpent to bite them.
22500	30	9	4	‡Even when their enemies drive them into captivity, ‡from there I will command the sword to kill them.‡I will not let them out of my sight;‡they will experience disaster, not prosperity.”
22501	30	9	5	‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will do this. ‡He touches the earth and it dissolves; ‡all who live on it mourn.‡The whole earth rises like the River Nile, ‡and then grows calm like the Nile in Egypt.
22502	30	9	6	‡He builds the upper rooms of his palace in heaven‡and sets its foundation supports on the earth. ‡He summons the water of the sea‡and pours it out on the earth’s surface.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is his name.
22503	30	9	7	‡“You Israelites are just like the Ethiopians in my sight,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‡“Certainly I brought Israel up from the land of Egypt, ‡but I also brought the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir.
22504	30	9	8	‡Look, the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is watching the sinful nation, ‡and I will destroy it from the face of the earth.‡But I will not completely destroy the family of Jacob,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22505	30	9	9	‡“For look, I am giving a command‡and I will shake the family of Israel together with all the nations.‡It will resemble a sieve being shaken, ‡when not even a pebble falls to the ground.
22506	30	9	10	‡All the sinners among my people will die by the sword – ‡the ones who say, ‘Disaster will not come near, it will not confront us.’
22507	30	9	11	‡“In that day I will rebuild the collapsing hut of David.‡I will seal its gaps,‡repair its ruins,‡and restore it to what it was like in days gone by.
22508	30	9	12	‡As a result they will conquer those left in Edom ‡and all the nations subject to my rule.” ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who is about to do this, is speaking!
22509	30	9	13	‡“Be sure of this, the time is coming,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡“when the plowman will catch up to the reaper ‡and the one who stomps the grapes will overtake the planter. ‡Juice will run down the slopes, ‡it will flow down all the hillsides.
22510	30	9	14	‡I will bring back my people, Israel; ‡they will rebuild the cities lying in rubble and settle down. ‡They will plant vineyards and drink the wine they produce; ‡they will grow orchards and eat the fruit they produce.
22511	30	9	15	‡I will plant them on their land‡and they will never again be uprooted from the land I have given them,”¶says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.
22512	31	1	1	‡The vision that Obadiah saw. ‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says this concerning Edom: ‡We have heard a report from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡An envoy was sent among the nations, saying, ‡“Arise! Let us make war against Edom!”
22513	31	1	2	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, “Look! I will make you a weak nation; ‡you will be greatly despised!
22514	31	1	3	‡Your presumptuous heart has deceived you – ‡you who reside in the safety of the rocky cliffs, ‡whose home is high in the mountains. ‡You think to yourself, ‡‘No one can bring me down to the ground!’
22515	31	1	4	‡Even if you were to soar high like an eagle, ‡even if you were to make your nest among the stars,‡I can bring you down even from there!” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22516	31	1	5	‡“If thieves came to rob you during the night, ‡they would steal only as much as they wanted! ‡If grape pickers came to harvest your vineyards, ‡they would leave some behind for the poor! ‡But you will be totally destroyed!
22517	31	1	6	‡How the people of Esau will be thoroughly plundered! ‡Their hidden valuables will be ransacked!
22518	31	1	7	‡All your allies will force you from your homeland! ‡Your treaty partners will deceive you and overpower you.‡Your trusted friends will set an ambush for you‡that will take you by surprise!
22519	31	1	8	‡At that time,” the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says,‡“I will destroy the wise sages of Edom, ‡the advisers from Esau’s mountain!
22520	31	1	9	‡Your warriors will be shattered, O Teman, ‡so that everyone will be destroyed from Esau’s mountain!
22521	31	1	10	‡“Because you violently slaughtered your relatives, the people of Jacob, ‡shame will cover you, and you will be destroyed forever.
22522	31	1	11	‡You stood aloof while strangers took his army captive,‡and foreigners advanced to his gates. ‡When they cast lots over Jerusalem, ‡you behaved as though you were in league with them.
22523	31	1	12	‡You should not have gloated when your relatives suffered calamity. ‡You should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah when they were destroyed. ‡You should not have boasted when they suffered adversity.
22524	31	1	13	‡You should not have entered the city of my people when they experienced distress. ‡You should not have joined in gloating over their misfortune when they suffered distress. ‡You should not have looted their wealth when they endured distress.
22525	31	1	14	‡You should not have stood at the fork in the road to slaughter those trying to escape. ‡You should not have captured their refugees when they suffered adversity.
22526	31	1	15	‡“For the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is approaching for all the nations! ‡Just as you have done, so it will be done to you.‡You will get exactly what your deeds deserve.
22527	31	1	16	‡For just as you have drunk on my holy mountain,‡so all the nations will drink continually. ‡They will drink, and they will gulp down;‡they will be as though they had never been.
22528	31	1	17	‡But on Mount Zion there will be a remnant of those who escape, ‡and it will be a holy place once again.‡The descendants of Jacob will conquer ‡those who had conquered them.
22529	31	1	18	‡The descendants of Jacob will be a fire,‡and the descendants of Joseph a flame.‡The descendants of Esau will be like stubble.‡They will burn them up and devour them.‡There will not be a single survivor of the descendants of Esau!”‡Indeed, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has spoken it.
22530	31	1	19	‡The people of the Negev will take possession of Esau’s mountain,‡and the people of the foothills will take ‡possession of the land of the Philistines.‡They will also take possession of the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria,‡and the people of Benjamin will take possession of Gilead.
22531	31	1	20	‡The exiles of this fortress of the people of Israel ‡will take possession of what belongs to ‡the people of Canaan, as far as Zarephath, ‡and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad ‡will take possession of the towns of the Negev.
22532	31	1	21	‡Those who have been delivered will go up on Mount Zion‡in order to rule over Esau’s mountain.¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will reign as King!
22533	32	1	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jonah son of Amittai,
22534	32	1	2	“Go immediately to Nineveh, that large capital city, and announce judgment against its people because their wickedness has come to my attention.”
22535	32	1	3	Instead, Jonah immediately headed off to Tarshish to escape from the commission of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. He traveled to Joppa and found a merchant ship heading to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard it to go with them to Tarshish far away from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22536	32	1	4	But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> hurled a powerful wind on the sea. Such a violent tempest arose on the sea that the ship threatened to break up!
22537	32	1	5	The sailors were so afraid that each cried out to his own god and they flung the ship’s cargo overboard to make the ship lighter. Jonah, meanwhile, had gone down into the hold below deck, had lain down, and was sound asleep.
22538	32	1	6	The ship’s captain approached him and said, “What are you doing asleep? Get up! Cry out to your god! Perhaps your god might take notice of us so that we might not die!”
22539	32	1	7	The sailors said to one another, “Come on, let’s cast lots to find out whose fault it is that this disaster has overtaken us. ” So they cast lots, and Jonah was singled out.
22540	32	1	8	They said to him, “Tell us, whose fault is it that this disaster has overtaken us? What’s your occupation? Where do you come from? What’s your country? And who are your people?”
22541	32	1	9	He said to them, “I am a Hebrew! And I worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”
22542	32	1	10	Hearing this, the men became even more afraid and said to him, “What have you done?” (The men said this because they knew that he was trying to escape from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> because he had previously told them.)
22543	32	1	11	Because the storm was growing worse and worse, they said to him, “What should we do to you so that the sea will calm down for us?”
22544	32	1	12	He said to them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea so that the sea will calm down for you, because I know it’s my fault you are in this severe storm.”
22545	32	1	13	Instead, they tried to row back to land, but they were not able to do so because the storm kept growing worse and worse.
22546	32	1	14	So they cried out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “Oh, please, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, don’t let us die on account of this man! Don’t hold us guilty of shedding innocent blood. After all, you, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, have done just as you pleased.”
22547	32	1	15	So they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped raging.
22548	32	1	16	The men feared the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> greatly, and earnestly vowed to offer lavish sacrifices to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22549	32	1	17	¶(2:1) The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sent a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish three days and three nights.
22550	32	2	1	Jonah prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God from the stomach of the fish
22551	32	2	2	and said, ‡“I called out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> from my distress, ‡and he answered me; ‡from the belly of Sheol I cried out for help, ‡and you heard my prayer.
22552	32	2	3	‡You threw me into the deep waters, ‡into the middle of the sea; ‡the ocean current engulfed me;‡all the mighty waves you sent swept over me.
22553	32	2	4	‡I thought I had been banished from your sight, ‡that I would never again see your holy temple!
22554	32	2	5	‡Water engulfed me up to my neck; ‡the deep ocean surrounded me;‡seaweed was wrapped around my head.
22555	32	2	6	‡I went down to the very bottoms of the mountains; ‡the gates of the netherworld barred me in forever; ‡but you brought me up from the Pit, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, my God.
22556	32	2	7	‡When my life was ebbing away, I called out to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡And my prayer came to you, to your holy temple.
22557	32	2	8	‡Those who worship worthless idols forfeit the mercy that could be theirs.
22558	32	2	9	‡But as for me, I promise to offer a sacrifice to you with a public declaration of praise; ‡I will surely do what I have promised. ‡Salvation belongs to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>!”
22559	32	2	10	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> commanded the fish and it disgorged Jonah on dry land.
22560	32	3	1	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to Jonah a second time,
22561	32	3	2	“Go immediately to Nineveh, that large city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.”
22562	32	3	3	So Jonah went immediately to Nineveh, in keeping with the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message. (Now Nineveh was an enormous city – it required three days to walk through it!)
22563	32	3	4	When Jonah began to enter the city one day’s walk, he announced, “At the end of forty days, Nineveh will be overthrown!”
22564	32	3	5	¶The people of Nineveh believed in God, and they declared a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.
22565	32	3	6	When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, took off his royal robe, put on sackcloth, and sat on ashes.
22566	32	3	7	He issued a proclamation and said, “In Nineveh, by the decree of the king and his nobles: No human or animal, cattle or sheep, is to taste anything; they must not eat and they must not drink water.
22567	32	3	8	Every person and animal must put on sackcloth and must cry earnestly to God, and everyone must turn from their evil way of living and from the violence that they do.
22568	32	3	9	Who knows? Perhaps God might be willing to change his mind and relent and turn from his fierce anger so that we might not die.”
22569	32	3	10	When God saw their actions – that they turned from their evil way of living! – God relented concerning the judgment he had threatened them with and he did not destroy them.
22570	32	4	1	¶This displeased Jonah terribly and he became very angry.
22571	32	4	2	He prayed to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and said, “Oh, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, this is just what I thought would happen when I was in my own country. This is what I tried to prevent by attempting to escape to Tarshish! – because I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in mercy, and one who relents concerning threatened judgment.
22572	32	4	3	So now, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, kill me instead, because I would rather die than live!”
22573	32	4	4	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “Are you really so very angry?”
22574	32	4	5	¶Jonah left the city and sat down east of it. He made a shelter for himself there and sat down under it in the shade to see what would happen to the city.
22575	32	4	6	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God appointed a little plant and caused it to grow up over Jonah to be a shade over his head to rescue him from his misery. Now Jonah was very delighted about the little plant.
22576	32	4	7	¶So God sent a worm at dawn the next day, and it attacked the little plant so that it dried up.
22577	32	4	8	When the sun began to shine, God sent a hot east wind. So the sun beat down on Jonah’s head, and he grew faint. So he despaired of life, and said, “I would rather die than live!”
22578	32	4	9	God said to Jonah, “Are you really so very angry about the little plant?” And he said, “I am as angry as I could possibly be!”
22579	32	4	10	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said, “You were upset about this little plant, something for which you have not worked nor did you do anything to make it grow. It grew up overnight and died the next day.
22580	32	4	11	Should I not be even more concerned about Nineveh, this enormous city? There are more than one hundred twenty thousand people in it who do not know right from wrong, as well as many animals!”
22581	33	1	1	¶This is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message that came to Micah of Moresheth during the time of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
22582	33	1	2	‡Listen, all you nations! ‡Pay attention, all inhabitants of earth! ‡The Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will act as a witness against you;‡the Lord will accuse you from his majestic palace.
22583	33	1	3	‡Look, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is coming out of his dwelling place!‡He will descend and march on the earth’s mountaintops!
22584	33	1	4	‡The mountains will crumble beneath him;‡and the valleys will split apart, ‡like wax before a fire,‡like water dumped down a steep slope.‡
22585	33	1	5	‡All this is because of Jacob’s rebellion‡and the sins of the nation of Israel.‡And just what is Jacob’s rebellion?‡Isn’t it Samaria’s doings? ‡And what is Judah’s sin? ‡Isn’t it Jerusalem’s doings?
22586	33	1	6	‡“I will turn Samaria into a heap of ruins in an open field,‡into a place for planting vineyards!‡I will dump the rubble of her walls down into the valley,‡and lay bare her foundations.
22587	33	1	7	‡All her carved idols will be smashed to pieces;‡all her metal cult statues will be destroyed by fire. ‡I will make a waste heap of all her images.‡Since she gathered the metal as a prostitute collects her wages,‡the idols will become a prostitute’s wages again.”
22588	33	1	8	‡For this reason I will mourn and wail;‡I will walk around barefoot and without my outer garments. ‡I will howl like a wild dog, ‡and screech like an owl.
22589	33	1	9	‡For Samaria’s disease is incurable.‡It has infected Judah;‡it has spread to the leadership of my people‡and even to Jerusalem!
22590	33	1	10	‡Don’t spread the news in Gath! ‡Don’t shed even a single tear! ‡In Beth Leaphrah roll about in mourning in the dust!
22591	33	1	11	‡Residents of Shaphir, pass by in nakedness and humiliation!‡The residents of Zaanan have not escaped. ‡Beth Ezel mourns, ‡“He takes from you what he desires.”
22592	33	1	12	‡Indeed, the residents of Maroth hope for something good to happen, ‡though the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent disaster against the city of Jerusalem.
22593	33	1	13	‡Residents of Lachish, hitch the horses to the chariots!‡You influenced Daughter Zion to sin, ‡for Israel’s rebellious deeds can be traced back to you!
22594	33	1	14	‡Therefore you will have to say farewell to Moresheth Gath.‡The residents of Achzib will be as disappointing‡as a dried up well to the kings of Israel.
22595	33	1	15	‡Residents of Mareshah, a conqueror will attack you, ‡the leaders of Israel shall flee to Adullam.
22596	33	1	16	‡Shave your heads bald as you mourn for the children you love; ‡shave your foreheads as bald as an eagle, ‡for they are taken from you into exile.
22597	33	2	1	‡Beware wicked schemers, ‡those who devise calamity as they lie in bed. ‡As soon as morning dawns they carry out their plans, ‡because they have the power to do so.
22598	33	2	2	‡They confiscate the fields they desire,‡and seize the houses they want. ‡They defraud people of their homes, ‡and deprive people of the land they have inherited.
22599	33	2	3	‡Therefore the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says this: “Look, I am devising disaster for this nation! ‡It will be like a yoke from which you cannot free your neck. ‡You will no longer walk proudly, ‡for it will be a time of catastrophe.
22600	33	2	4	‡In that day people will sing this taunt song to you – ‡they will mock you with this lament: ‡‘We are completely destroyed;‡they sell off the property of my people.‡How they remove it from me! ‡They assign our fields to the conqueror.’
22601	33	2	5	‡Therefore no one will assign you land in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s community.
22602	33	2	6	‡‘Don’t preach with such impassioned rhetoric,’ they say excitedly. ‡‘These prophets should not preach of such things;‡we will not be overtaken by humiliation.’
22603	33	2	7	‡Does the family of Jacob say, ‡‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s patience can’t be exhausted – ‡he would never do such things’? ‡To be sure, my commands bring a reward‡for those who obey them,
22604	33	2	8	‡but you rise up as an enemy against my people. ‡You steal a robe from a friend, ‡from those who pass by peacefully as if returning from a war.
22605	33	2	9	‡You wrongly evict widows among my people from their cherished homes.‡You defraud their children of their prized inheritance.
22606	33	2	10	‡But you are the ones who will be forced to leave! ‡For this land is not secure! ‡Sin will thoroughly destroy it!
22607	33	2	11	‡If a lying windbag should come and say, ‡‘I’ll promise you blessings of wine and beer,’ ‡he would be just the right preacher for these people!
22608	33	2	12	‡I will certainly gather all of you, O Jacob,‡I will certainly assemble those Israelites who remain. ‡I will bring them together like sheep in a fold, ‡like a flock in the middle of a pasture; ‡they will be so numerous that they will make a lot of noise.
22609	33	2	13	‡The one who can break through barriers will lead them out ‡they will break out, pass through the gate, and leave. ‡Their king will advance before them,‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> himself will lead them.
22610	33	3	1	‡I said,‡“Listen, you leaders of Jacob,‡you rulers of the nation of Israel!‡You ought to know what is just,
22611	33	3	2	‡yet you hate what is good, ‡and love what is evil. ‡You flay my people’s skin ‡and rip the flesh from their bones.
22612	33	3	3	‡You devour my people’s flesh,‡strip off their skin,‡and crush their bones.‡You chop them up like flesh in a pot – ‡like meat in a kettle.
22613	33	3	4	‡Someday these sinful leaders will cry to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for help,‡but he will not answer them.‡He will hide his face from them at that time,‡because they have done such wicked deeds.”
22614	33	3	5	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said about the prophets who mislead my people, ‡“If someone gives them enough to eat,‡they offer an oracle of peace. ‡But if someone does not give them food,‡they are ready to declare war on him.
22615	33	3	6	‡Therefore night will fall, and you will receive no visions; ‡it will grow dark, and you will no longer be able to read the omens. ‡The sun will set on these prophets,‡and the daylight will turn to darkness over their heads.
22616	33	3	7	‡The prophets will be ashamed;‡the omen readers will be humiliated.‡All of them will cover their mouths, ‡for they will receive no divine oracles.”
22617	33	3	8	‡But I am full of the courage that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit gives,‡and have a strong commitment to justice. ‡This enables me to confront Jacob with its rebellion,‡and Israel with its sin.
22618	33	3	9	‡Listen to this, you leaders of the family of Jacob,‡you rulers of the nation of Israel!‡You hate justice‡and pervert all that is right.
22619	33	3	10	‡You build Zion through bloody crimes, ‡Jerusalem through unjust violence.
22620	33	3	11	‡Her leaders take bribes when they decide legal cases, ‡her priests proclaim rulings for profit,‡and her prophets read omens for pay.‡Yet they claim to trust the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> and say,‡“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is among us. ‡Disaster will not overtake us!”
22621	33	3	12	‡Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed up like a field,‡Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins,‡and the Temple Mount will become a hill overgrown with brush!
22622	33	4	1	‡In the future the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s Temple Mount will be the most important mountain of all; ‡it will be more prominent than other hills. ‡People will stream to it.
22623	33	4	2	‡Many nations will come, saying,‡“Come on! Let’s go up to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s mountain,‡to the temple of Jacob’s God,‡so he can teach us his ways‡and we can live by his laws.” ‡For instruction will proceed from Zion,‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message from Jerusalem.
22624	33	4	3	‡He will arbitrate between many peoples‡and settle disputes between many distant nations. ‡They will beat their swords into plowshares, ‡and their spears into pruning hooks. ‡Nations will not use weapons against other nations,‡and they will no longer train for war.
22625	33	4	4	‡Each will sit under his own grapevine‡or under his own fig tree without any fear. ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has decreed it.
22626	33	4	5	‡Though all the nations follow their respective gods, ‡we will follow the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God forever.
22627	33	4	6	‡“In that day,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “I will gather the lame,‡and assemble the outcasts whom I injured.
22628	33	4	7	‡I will transform the lame into the nucleus of a new nation, ‡and those far off into a mighty nation.‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will reign over them on Mount Zion,‡from that day forward and forevermore.”
22629	33	4	8	‡As for you, watchtower for the flock, ‡fortress of Daughter Zion – ‡your former dominion will be restored, ‡the sovereignty that belongs to Daughter Jerusalem.
22630	33	4	9	‡Jerusalem, why are you now shouting so loudly? ‡Has your king disappeared? ‡Has your wise leader been destroyed?‡Is this why pain grips you as if you were a woman in labor?
22631	33	4	10	‡Twist and strain, Daughter Zion, as if you were in labor!‡For you will leave the city‡and live in the open field.‡You will go to Babylon,‡but there you will be rescued.‡There the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will deliver you‡from the power of your enemies.
22632	33	4	11	‡Many nations have now assembled against you.‡They say, “Jerusalem must be desecrated, ‡so we can gloat over Zion!”
22633	33	4	12	‡But they do not know what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is planning;‡they do not understand his strategy.‡He has gathered them like stalks of grain to be threshed at the threshing floor.
22634	33	4	13	‡“Get up and thresh, Daughter Zion!‡For I will give you iron horns; ‡I will give you bronze hooves,‡and you will crush many nations.” ‡You will devote to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> the spoils you take from them,‡and dedicate their wealth to the sovereign Ruler of the whole earth.
22635	33	5	1	‡(4:14) But now slash yourself, daughter surrounded by soldiers! ‡We are besieged!‡With a scepter they strike Israel’s ruler ‡on the side of his face.
22636	33	5	2	‡(5:1) As for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, ‡seemingly insignificant among the clans of Judah – ‡from you a king will emerge who will rule over Israel on my behalf, ‡one whose origins are in the distant past.
22637	33	5	3	‡So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will hand the people of Israel over to their enemies ‡until the time when the woman in labor gives birth. ‡Then the rest of the king’s countrymen will return‡to be reunited with the people of Israel.
22638	33	5	4	‡He will assume his post and shepherd the people by the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s strength,‡by the sovereign authority of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> his God. ‡They will live securely, for at that time he will be honored ‡even in the distant regions of the earth.
22639	33	5	5	‡He will give us peace. ‡Should the Assyrians try to invade our land‡and attempt to set foot in our fortresses, ‡we will send against them seven shepherd-rulers, ‡make that eight commanders.
22640	33	5	6	‡They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,‡the land of Nimrod with a drawn sword. ‡Our king will rescue us from the Assyrians‡should they attempt to invade our land‡and try to set foot in our territory.
22641	33	5	7	‡Those survivors from Jacob will live ‡in the midst of many nations. ‡They will be like the dew the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> sends,‡like the rain on the grass,‡that does not hope for men to come‡or wait around for humans to arrive.
22642	33	5	8	‡Those survivors from Jacob will live among the nations,‡in the midst of many peoples.‡They will be like a lion among the animals of the forest,‡like a young lion among the flocks of sheep,‡which attacks when it passes through;‡it rips its prey and there is no one to stop it.
22643	33	5	9	‡Lift your hand triumphantly against your adversaries; ‡may all your enemies be destroyed!
22644	33	5	10	‡“In that day,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡“I will destroy your horses from your midst,‡and smash your chariots.
22645	33	5	11	‡I will destroy the cities of your land,‡and tear down all your fortresses.
22646	33	5	12	‡I will remove the sorcery that you practice, ‡and you will no longer have omen readers living among you.
22647	33	5	13	‡I will remove your idols and sacred pillars from your midst;‡you will no longer worship what your own hands made.
22648	33	5	14	‡I will uproot your images of Asherah from your midst,‡and destroy your idols.
22649	33	5	15	‡With furious anger I will carry out vengeance‡on the nations that do not obey me.”
22650	33	6	1	‡Listen to what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says:‡“Get up! Defend yourself before the mountains! ‡Present your case before the hills!”
22651	33	6	2	‡Hear the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s accusation, you mountains,‡you enduring foundations of the earth!‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has a case against his people;‡he has a dispute with Israel!
22652	33	6	3	‡“My people, how have I wronged you? ‡How have I wearied you? Answer me!
22653	33	6	4	‡In fact, I brought you up from the land of Egypt,‡I delivered you from that place of slavery.‡I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.
22654	33	6	5	‡My people, recall how King Balak of Moab planned to harm you, ‡how Balaam son of Beor responded to him.‡Recall how you journeyed from Shittim to Gilgal,‡so you might acknowledge that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has treated you fairly.”
22655	33	6	6	‡With what should I enter the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence?‡With what should I bow before the sovereign God? ‡Should I enter his presence with burnt offerings,‡with year-old calves?
22656	33	6	7	‡Will the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> accept a thousand rams,‡or ten thousand streams of olive oil?‡Should I give him my firstborn child as payment for my rebellion,‡my offspring – my own flesh and blood – for my sin?
22657	33	6	8	‡He has told you, O man, what is good,‡and what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> really wants from you: ‡He wants you to carry out justice, to love faithfulness, ‡and to live obediently before your God.
22658	33	6	9	‡Listen! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is calling to the city!‡It is wise to respect your authority, O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>! ‡Listen, O nation, and those assembled in the city!
22659	33	6	10	‡“I will not overlook, O sinful house, the dishonest gain you have hoarded away, ‡or the smaller-than-standard measure I hate so much.
22660	33	6	11	‡I do not condone the use of rigged scales,‡or a bag of deceptive weights.
22661	33	6	12	‡The city’s wealthy people readily resort to violence; ‡her inhabitants tell lies,‡their tongues speak deceptive words.
22662	33	6	13	‡I will strike you brutally ‡and destroy you because of your sin.
22663	33	6	14	‡You will eat, but not be satisfied.‡Even if you have the strength to overtake some prey, ‡you will not be able to carry it away; ‡if you do happen to carry away something, ‡I will deliver it over to the sword.
22664	33	6	15	‡You will plant crops, but will not harvest them;‡you will squeeze oil from the olives, but you will have no oil to rub on your bodies; ‡you will squeeze juice from the grapes, but you will have no wine to drink.
22665	33	6	16	‡You follow Omri’s edicts, ‡and all the practices of Ahab’s dynasty; ‡you follow their policies. ‡Therefore I will make you an appalling sight, ‡the city’s inhabitants will be taunted derisively, ‡and nations will mock all of you.”
22666	33	7	1	‡Woe is me!‡For I am like those gathering fruit,‡and those harvesting grapes,‡when there is no grape cluster to eat,‡and no fresh figs that my stomach craves.
22667	33	7	2	‡Faithful men have disappeared from the land;‡there are no godly men left. ‡They all wait in ambush to shed blood; ‡they hunt their own brother with a net.
22668	33	7	3	‡They are experts at doing evil; ‡government officials and judges take bribes, ‡prominent men announce what they wish and then they plan it out.
22669	33	7	4	‡The best of them is like a thorn;‡their godly are like a thorn bush. ‡Woe to your watchmen; ‡your appointed punishment is on the way. ‡The time of their confusion is now.
22670	33	7	5	‡Do not rely on a friend;‡do not trust a companion!‡Even with the one who lies in your arms,‡do not share secrets!
22671	33	7	6	‡For a son thinks his father is a fool,‡a daughter challenges her mother,‡and a daughter-in-law her mother-in-law;‡a man’s enemies are his own family.
22672	33	7	7	‡But I will keep watching for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡I will wait for the God who delivers me.‡My God will listen to me.
22673	33	7	8	‡My enemies, do not gloat over me!‡Though I have fallen, I will get up.‡Though I sit in darkness, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be my light.
22674	33	7	9	‡I must endure the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s fury,‡for I have sinned against him.‡But then he will defend my cause, ‡and accomplish justice on my behalf.‡He will lead me out into the light;‡I will witness his deliverance.
22675	33	7	10	‡When my enemies see this, they will be covered with shame.‡They say to me, “Where is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God?”‡I will gloat over them. ‡Then they will be trampled down ‡like mud in the streets.
22676	33	7	11	‡It will be a day for rebuilding your walls;‡in that day your boundary will be extended.
22677	33	7	12	‡In that day people will come to you ‡from Assyria as far as Egypt,‡from Egypt as far as the Euphrates River, ‡from the seacoasts and the mountains.
22678	33	7	13	‡The earth will become desolate‡because of what its inhabitants have done.
22679	33	7	14	‡Shepherd your people with your rod, ‡the flock that belongs to you, ‡the one that lives alone in a thicket,‡in the midst of a pastureland. ‡Allow them to graze in Bashan and Gilead, ‡as they did in the old days.
22680	33	7	15	‡“As in the days when you departed from the land of Egypt,‡I will show you miraculous deeds.”
22681	33	7	16	‡Nations will see this and be disappointed by all their strength,‡they will put their hands over their mouths,‡and act as if they were deaf.
22682	33	7	17	‡They will lick the dust like a snake,‡like serpents crawling on the ground. ‡They will come trembling from their strongholds‡to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> our God; ‡they will be terrified of you.
22683	33	7	18	‡Who is a God like you? ‡Who forgives sin‡and pardons the rebellion‡of those who remain among his people? ‡Who does not stay angry forever,‡but delights in showing loyal love?
22684	33	7	19	‡Who will once again have mercy on us?‡Who will conquer our evil deeds?‡Who will hurl all our sins into the depths of the sea?
22685	33	7	20	‡You will be loyal to Jacob‡and extend your loyal love to Abraham, ‡which you promised on oath to our ancestors in ancient times.
22686	34	1	1	‡This is an oracle about Nineveh;‡the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:
22687	34	1	2	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is a zealous and avenging God;‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is avenging and very angry. ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> takes vengeance against his foes;‡he sustains his rage against his enemies.
22688	34	1	3	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is slow to anger but great in power; ‡the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.‡He marches out in the whirlwind and the raging storm; ‡dark storm clouds billow like dust under his feet.
22689	34	1	4	‡He shouts a battle cry against the sea and makes it dry up; ‡he makes all the rivers run dry.‡Bashan and Carmel wither; ‡the blossom of Lebanon withers.
22690	34	1	5	‡The mountains tremble before him, ‡the hills convulse; ‡the earth is laid waste before him,‡the world and all its inhabitants are laid waste.
22691	34	1	6	‡No one can withstand his indignation! ‡No one can resist his fierce anger! ‡His wrath is poured out like volcanic fire,‡boulders are broken up as he approaches.
22692	34	1	7	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is good – ‡indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress, ‡and he protects those who seek refuge in him.
22693	34	1	8	‡But with an overwhelming flood ‡he will make a complete end of Nineveh; ‡he will drive his enemies into darkness.
22694	34	1	9	‡Whatever you plot against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, he will completely destroy! ‡Distress will not arise a second time.
22695	34	1	10	‡Surely they will be totally consumed ‡like entangled thorn bushes, ‡like the drink of drunkards, ‡like very dry stubble.
22696	34	1	11	‡From you, O Nineveh, one has marched forth who plots evil against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡a wicked military strategist.
22697	34	1	12	‡This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says: ‡“Even though they are powerful – ‡and what is more, even though their army is numerous – ‡nevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away! ‡Although I afflicted you,‡I will afflict you no more.
22698	34	1	13	‡And now, I will break Assyria’s yoke bar from your neck; ‡I will tear apart the shackles that are on you.”
22699	34	1	14	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has issued a decree against you: ‡“Your dynasty will come to an end. ‡I will destroy the idols and images in the temples of your gods.‡I will desecrate your grave – because you are accursed!”
22700	34	1	15	‡(2:1) Look! A herald is running on the mountains!‡A messenger is proclaiming deliverance: ‡“Celebrate your sacred festivals, O Judah!‡Fulfill your sacred vows to praise God! ‡For never again will the wicked Assyrians invade you,‡they have been completely destroyed.”
22701	34	2	1	‡(2:2) “An enemy who will scatter you, Nineveh, has advanced against you!” ‡“Guard the rampart! ‡Watch the road!‡Prepare yourselves for battle! ‡Muster your mighty strength!”
22702	34	2	2	‡For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is about to restore the majesty of Jacob,‡as well as the majesty of Israel,‡though their enemies have plundered them ‡and have destroyed their fields.
22703	34	2	3	‡The shields of his warriors are dyed red; ‡the mighty soldiers are dressed in scarlet garments. ‡The chariots are in flashing metal fittings ‡on the day of battle; ‡the soldiers brandish their spears.
22704	34	2	4	‡The chariots race madly through the streets,‡they rush back and forth in the broad plazas;‡they look like lightning bolts, ‡they dash here and there like flashes of lightning.

22709	34	2	9	‡Her conquerors cry out: ‡“Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!”‡There is no end to the treasure;‡riches of every kind of precious thing.

22730	34	3	17	‡Your courtiers are like locusts,‡your officials are like a swarm of locusts!‡They encamp in the walls on a cold day,‡yet when the sun rises, they fly away; ‡and no one knows where they are.
22731	34	3	18	‡Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria!‡Your officers are slumbering! ‡Your people are scattered like sheep on the mountains‡and there is no one to regather them!
22732	34	3	19	‡Your destruction is like an incurable wound; ‡your demise is like a fatal injury! ‡All who hear what has happened to you will clap their hands for joy, ¶for no one ever escaped your endless cruelty!
22733	35	1	1	¶This is the oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw:
22734	35	1	2	‡How long, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, must I cry for help? ‡But you do not listen!‡I call out to you, “Violence!” ‡But you do not deliver!
22735	35	1	3	‡Why do you force me to witness injustice? ‡Why do you put up with wrongdoing? ‡Destruction and violence confront me;‡conflict is present and one must endure strife.
22736	35	1	4	‡For this reason the law lacks power, ‡and justice is never carried out. ‡Indeed, the wicked intimidate the innocent. ‡For this reason justice is perverted.
22737	35	1	5	‡“Look at the nations and pay attention! ‡You will be shocked and amazed! ‡For I will do something in your lifetime ‡that you will not believe even though you are forewarned.
22738	35	1	6	‡Look, I am about to empower the Babylonians,‡that ruthless and greedy nation.‡They sweep across the surface of the earth,‡seizing dwelling places that do not belong to them.
22739	35	1	7	‡They are frightening and terrifying;‡they decide for themselves what is right.
22740	35	1	8	‡Their horses are faster than leopards‡and more alert than wolves in the desert. ‡Their horses gallop, ‡their horses come a great distance;‡like vultures they swoop down quickly to devour their prey.
22741	35	1	9	‡All of them intend to do violence;‡every face is determined. ‡They take prisoners as easily as one scoops up sand.
22742	35	1	10	‡They mock kings‡and laugh at rulers.‡They laugh at every fortified city;‡they build siege ramps and capture them.
22743	35	1	11	‡They sweep by like the wind and pass on. ‡But the one who considers himself a god will be held guilty.”
22744	35	1	12	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord </span>, you have been active from ancient times; ‡my sovereign God, you are immortal. ‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, you have made them your instrument of judgment. ‡Protector, you have appointed them as your instrument of punishment.
22745	35	1	13	‡You are too just to tolerate evil;‡you are unable to condone wrongdoing.‡So why do you put up with such treacherous people? ‡Why do you say nothing when the wicked devour those more righteous than they are?
22746	35	1	14	‡You made people like fish in the sea,‡like animals in the sea that have no ruler.
22747	35	1	15	‡The Babylonian tyrant pulls them all up with a fishhook;‡he hauls them in with his throw net. ‡When he catches them in his dragnet,‡he is very happy.
22748	35	1	16	‡Because of his success he offers sacrifices to his throw net‡and burns incense to his dragnet; ‡for because of them he has plenty of food, ‡and more than enough to eat.
22749	35	1	17	‡Will he then continue to fill and empty his throw net? ‡Will he always destroy nations and spare none?
22750	35	2	1	‡I will stand at my watch post;‡I will remain stationed on the city wall. ‡I will keep watching, so I can see what he says to me‡and can know how I should answer‡when he counters my argument.
22751	35	2	2	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> responded: ‡“Write down this message! Record it legibly on tablets,‡so the one who announces it may read it easily.
22752	35	2	3	‡For the message is a witness to what is decreed; ‡it gives reliable testimony about how matters will turn out. ‡Even if the message is not fulfilled right away, wait patiently; ‡for it will certainly come to pass – it will not arrive late.
22753	35	2	4	‡Look, the one whose desires are not upright will faint from exhaustion, ‡but the person of integrity will live because of his faithfulness.
22754	35	2	5	‡Indeed, wine will betray the proud, restless man! ‡His appetite is as big as Sheol’s; ‡like death, he is never satisfied.‡He gathers all the nations;‡he seizes all peoples.
22755	35	2	6	‡“But all these nations will someday taunt him ‡and ridicule him with proverbial sayings: ‡‘Woe to the one who accumulates what does not belong to him ‡(How long will this go on?) – ‡he who gets rich by extortion!’
22756	35	2	7	‡Your creditors will suddenly attack; ‡those who terrify you will spring into action, ‡and they will rob you.
22757	35	2	8	‡Because you robbed many countries, ‡all who are left among the nations will rob you.‡You have shed human blood ‡and committed violent acts against lands, cities, and those who live in them.
22758	35	2	9	‡The one who builds his house by unjust gain is as good as dead. ‡He does this so he can build his nest way up high‡and escape the clutches of disaster.
22759	35	2	10	‡Your schemes will bring shame to your house.‡Because you destroyed many nations, you will self-destruct.
22760	35	2	11	‡For the stones in the walls will cry out,‡and the wooden rafters will answer back.
22761	35	2	12	‡Woe to the one who builds a city by bloodshed– ‡he who starts a town by unjust deeds.
22762	35	2	13	‡Be sure of this! The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has decreed:‡The nations’ efforts will go up in smoke; ‡their exhausting work will be for nothing.
22763	35	2	14	‡For recognition of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sovereign majesty will fill the earth‡just as the waters fill up the sea. ‡
22764	35	2	15	‡“Woe to you who force your neighbor to drink wine – ‡you who make others intoxicated by forcing them to drink from the bowl of your furious anger, ‡so you can look at their naked bodies.
22765	35	2	16	‡But you will become drunk with shame, not majesty. ‡Now it is your turn to drink and expose your uncircumcised foreskin! ‡The cup of wine in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s right hand is coming to you,‡and disgrace will replace your majestic glory!
22766	35	2	17	‡For you will pay in full for your violent acts against Lebanon; ‡terrifying judgment will come upon you because of the way you destroyed the wild animals living there. ‡You have shed human blood‡and committed violent acts against lands, cities, and those who live in them.
22767	35	2	18	‡What good is an idol? Why would a craftsman make it? ‡What good is a metal image that gives misleading oracles? ‡Why would its creator place his trust in it ‡and make such mute, worthless things?
22768	35	2	19	‡Woe to the one who says to wood, ‘Wake up!’ – ‡he who says to speechless stone, ‘Awake!’‡Can it give reliable guidance? ‡It is overlaid with gold and silver;‡it has no life’s breath inside it.
22769	35	2	20	‡But the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is in his majestic palace. ‡The whole earth is speechless in his presence!”
22770	35	3	1	‡This is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet:
22771	35	3	2	‡<span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, I have heard the report of what you did; ‡I am awed, <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, by what you accomplished. ‡In our time repeat those deeds; ‡in our time reveal them again. ‡But when you cause turmoil, remember to show us mercy!
22772	35	3	3	‡God comes from Teman, ‡the Holy One from Mount Paran. <i>Selah</i>. ‡His splendor has covered the skies, ‡the earth is full of his glory.
22773	35	3	4	‡His brightness will be as lightning; ‡a two-pronged lightning bolt flashing from his hand. ‡This is the outward display of his power.
22774	35	3	5	‡Plague will go before him;‡pestilence will march right behind him.
22775	35	3	6	‡He took his battle position and shook the earth;‡with a mere look he frightened the nations.‡The ancient mountains disintegrated; ‡the primeval hills were flattened.‡His are ancient roads.
22776	35	3	7	‡I saw the tents of Cushan overwhelmed by trouble; ‡the tent curtains of the land of Midian were shaking.
22777	35	3	8	‡Was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> mad at the rivers?‡Were you angry with the rivers?‡Were you enraged at the sea? ‡Such that you would climb into your horse-drawn chariots, ‡your victorious chariots?
22778	35	3	9	‡Your bow is ready for action; ‡you commission your arrows. <i>Selah</i>.‡You cause flash floods on the earth’s surface.
22779	35	3	10	‡When the mountains see you, they shake.‡The torrential downpour sweeps through. ‡The great deep shouts out;‡it lifts its hands high.
22780	35	3	11	‡The sun and moon stand still in their courses; ‡the flash of your arrows drives them away, ‡the bright light of your lightning-quick spear.
22781	35	3	12	‡You furiously stomp on the earth,‡you angrily trample down the nations.
22782	35	3	13	‡You march out to deliver your people,‡to deliver your special servant. ‡You strike the leader of the wicked nation, ‡laying him open from the lower body to the neck. <i>Selah</i>.
22783	35	3	14	‡You pierce the heads of his warriors with a spear. ‡They storm forward to scatter us; ‡they shout with joy as if they were plundering the poor with no opposition.
22784	35	3	15	‡But you trample on the sea with your horses,‡on the surging, raging waters.
22785	35	3	16	‡I listened and my stomach churned; ‡the sound made my lips quiver.‡My frame went limp, as if my bones were decaying, ‡and I shook as I tried to walk. ‡I long for the day of distress‡to come upon the people who attack us.
22786	35	3	17	‡When the fig tree does not bud,‡and there are no grapes on the vines;‡when the olive trees do not produce, ‡and the fields yield no crops; ‡when the sheep disappear from the pen,‡and there are no cattle in the stalls,
22787	35	3	18	‡I will rejoice because of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡I will be happy because of the God who delivers me!
22788	35	3	19	‡The sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is my source of strength. ‡He gives me the agility of a deer; ‡he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain. ¶(This prayer is for the song leader. It is to be accompanied by stringed instruments.)
22789	36	1	1	¶This is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah during the time of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah:
22790	36	1	2	‡“I will destroy everything from the face of the earth,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22791	36	1	3	‡“I will destroy people and animals;‡I will destroy the birds in the sky‡and the fish in the sea.‡(The idolatrous images of these creatures will be destroyed along with evil people.) ‡I will remove humanity from the face of the earth,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22792	36	1	4	‡“I will attack Judah‡and all who live in Jerusalem. ‡I will remove from this place every trace of Baal worship, ‡as well as the very memory of the pagan priests.
22793	36	1	5	‡I will remove those who worship the stars in the sky from their rooftops, ‡those who swear allegiance to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> while taking oaths in the name of their ‘king,’
22794	36	1	6	‡and those who turn their backs on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>‡and do not want the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s help or guidance.”
22795	36	1	7	‡Be silent before the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‡for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s day of judgment is almost here. ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has prepared a sacrificial meal; ‡he has ritually purified his guests.
22796	36	1	8	‡“On the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s sacrificial meal,‡I will punish the princes and the king’s sons,‡and all who wear foreign styles of clothing.
22797	36	1	9	‡On that day I will punish all who leap over the threshold, ‡who fill the house of their master with wealth taken by violence and deceit.
22798	36	1	10	‡On that day,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡“a loud cry will go up from the Fish Gate, ‡wailing from the city’s newer district, ‡and a loud crash from the hills.
22799	36	1	11	‡Wail, you who live in the market district, ‡for all the merchants will disappear ‡and those who count money will be removed.
22800	36	1	12	‡At that time I will search through Jerusalem with lamps.‡I will punish the people who are entrenched in their sin, ‡those who think to themselves, ‡‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> neither rewards nor punishes.’
22801	36	1	13	‡Their wealth will be stolen‡and their houses ruined!‡They will not live in the houses they have built,‡nor will they drink the wine from the vineyards they have planted.
22802	36	1	14	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s great day of judgment is almost here;‡it is approaching very rapidly!‡There will be a bitter sound on the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s day of judgment;‡at that time warriors will cry out in battle.
22803	36	1	15	‡That day will be a day of God’s anger, ‡a day of distress and hardship,‡a day of devastation and ruin,‡a day of darkness and gloom,‡a day of clouds and dark skies,
22804	36	1	16	‡a day of trumpet blasts and battle cries. ‡Judgment will fall on the fortified cities and the high corner towers.
22805	36	1	17	‡I will bring distress on the people ‡and they will stumble like blind men,‡for they have sinned against the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.‡Their blood will be poured out like dirt;‡their flesh will be scattered like manure.
22806	36	1	18	‡Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them‡in the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angry judgment.‡The whole earth will be consumed by his fiery wrath. ‡Indeed, he will bring terrifying destruction on all who live on the earth.”
22807	36	2	1	‡Bunch yourselves together like straw, you undesirable nation,
22808	36	2	2	‡before God’s decree becomes reality and the day of opportunity disappears like windblown chaff, ‡before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s raging anger overtakes you – ‡before the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angry judgment overtakes you!
22809	36	2	3	‡Seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s favor, all you humble people of the land who have obeyed his commands! ‡Strive to do what is right! Strive to be humble! ‡Maybe you will be protected on the day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s angry judgment.
22810	36	2	4	‡Indeed, Gaza will be deserted ‡and Ashkelon will become a heap of ruins. ‡Invaders will drive away the people of Ashdod by noon, ‡and Ekron will be overthrown.
22811	36	2	5	‡Beware, you who live by the sea, the people who came from Crete. ‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines:‡“I will destroy everyone who lives there!”
22812	36	2	6	‡The seacoast will be used as pasture lands by the shepherds‡and as pens for their flocks.
22813	36	2	7	‡Those who are left from the kingdom of Judah will take possession of it. ‡By the sea they will graze,‡in the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down in the evening,‡for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God will intervene for them and restore their prosperity.
22814	36	2	8	‡“I have heard Moab’s taunts‡and the Ammonites’ insults.‡They taunted my people‡and verbally harassed those living in Judah.
22815	36	2	9	‡Therefore, as surely as I live,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel,‡“be certain that Moab will become like Sodom‡and the Ammonites like Gomorrah.‡They will be overrun by weeds, ‡filled with salt pits, ‡and permanently desolate.‡Those of my people who are left will plunder their belongings; ‡those who are left in Judah will take possession of their land.”
22816	36	2	10	‡This is how they will be repaid for their arrogance, ‡for they taunted and verbally harassed the people of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
22817	36	2	11	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will terrify them, ‡for he will weaken all the gods of the earth.‡All the distant nations will worship the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> in their own lands.
22818	36	2	12	‡“You Ethiopians will also die by my sword!”
22819	36	2	13	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will attack the north ‡and destroy Assyria.‡He will make Nineveh a heap of ruins;‡it will be as barren as the desert.
22820	36	2	14	‡Flocks and herds will lie down in the middle of it,‡as well as every kind of wild animal. ‡Owls will sleep in the tops of its support pillars;‡they will hoot through the windows. ‡Rubble will cover the thresholds; ‡even the cedar work will be exposed to the elements.
22821	36	2	15	‡This is how the once-proud city will end up – ‡the city that was so secure. ‡She thought to herself, “I am unique! No one can compare to me!” ‡What a heap of ruins she has become, a place where wild animals live!‡Everyone who passes by her taunts her and shakes his fist.
22822	36	3	1	‡Beware to the filthy, stained city;‡the city filled with oppressors!
22823	36	3	2	‡She is disobedient; ‡she has refused correction. ‡She does not trust the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>;‡she has not sought the advice of her God.
22824	36	3	3	‡Her princes are as fierce as roaring lions; ‡her rulers are as hungry as wolves in the desert, ‡who completely devour their prey by morning.
22825	36	3	4	‡Her prophets are proud; ‡they are deceitful men.‡Her priests have defiled what is holy; ‡they have broken God’s laws.
22826	36	3	5	‡The just <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> resides within her;‡he commits no unjust acts. ‡Every morning he reveals his justice.‡At dawn he appears without fail. ‡Yet the unjust know no shame.
22827	36	3	6	‡“I destroyed nations;‡their walled cities are in ruins.‡I turned their streets into ruins;‡no one passes through them.‡Their cities are desolate; ‡no one lives there.
22828	36	3	7	‡I thought, ‘Certainly you will respect me!‡Now you will accept correction!’‡If she had done so, her home would not be destroyed ‡by all the punishments I have threatened. ‡But they eagerly sinned‡in everything they did.
22829	36	3	8	‡Therefore you must wait patiently for me,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡“for the day when I attack and take plunder. ‡I have decided to gather nations together‡and assemble kingdoms,‡so I can pour out my fury on them – ‡all my raging anger.‡For the whole earth will be consumed‡by my fiery anger.
22830	36	3	9	‡Know for sure that I will then enable‡the nations to give me acceptable praise. ‡All of them will invoke the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s name when they pray, ‡and will worship him in unison.
22831	36	3	10	‡From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, ‡those who pray to me, my dispersed people, ‡will bring me tribute.
22832	36	3	11	‡In that day you will not be ashamed of all your rebelliousness against me, ‡for then I will remove from your midst those who proudly boast, ‡and you will never again be arrogant on my holy hill.
22833	36	3	12	‡I will leave in your midst a humble and meek group of people, ‡and they will find safety in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence.
22834	36	3	13	‡The Israelites who remain will not act deceitfully.‡They will not lie,‡and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths.‡Indeed, they will graze peacefully like sheep and lie down;‡no one will terrify them.”
22835	36	3	14	‡Shout for joy, Daughter Zion! ‡Shout out, Israel!‡Be happy and boast with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem!
22836	36	3	15	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has removed the judgment against you; ‡he has turned back your enemy.‡Israel’s king, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, is in your midst!‡You no longer need to fear disaster.
22837	36	3	16	‡On that day they will say to Jerusalem,‡“Don’t be afraid, Zion!‡Your hands must not be paralyzed from panic!
22838	36	3	17	‡The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God is in your midst;‡he is a warrior who can deliver.‡He takes great delight in you; ‡he renews you by his love; ‡he shouts for joy over you.”
22839	36	3	18	‡“As for those who grieve because they cannot attend the festivals – ‡I took them away from you;‡they became tribute and were a source of shame to you.
22840	36	3	19	‡Look, at that time I will deal with those who mistreated you.‡I will rescue the lame sheep ‡and gather together the scattered sheep.‡I will take away their humiliation‡and make the whole earth admire and respect them.
22841	36	3	20	‡At that time I will lead you – ‡at the time I gather you together. ‡Be sure of this! I will make all the nations of the earth respect and admire you ¶when you see me restore you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22842	37	1	1	¶On the first day of the sixth month of King Darius’ second year, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak:
22843	37	1	2	¶This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has said: “These people have said, ‘The time for rebuilding the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple has not yet come.’”
22844	37	1	3	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came through the prophet Haggai as follows:
22845	37	1	4	“Is it right for you to live in richly paneled houses while my temple is in ruins?
22846	37	1	5	Here then, this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has said: ‘Think carefully about what you are doing.
22847	37	1	6	You have planted much, but have harvested little. You eat, but are never filled. You drink, but are still thirsty. You put on clothes, but are not warm. Those who earn wages end up with holes in their money bags.’”
22848	37	1	7	¶“Moreover, this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has said: ‘Pay close attention to these things also.
22849	37	1	8	Go up to the hill country and bring back timber to build the temple. Then I will be pleased and honored,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22850	37	1	9	‘You expected a large harvest, but instead there was little. And when you would bring it home, I would blow it right away. Why?’ asks the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. ‘Because my temple remains in ruins, thanks to each of you favoring his own house!
22851	37	1	10	This is why the sky has held back its dew and the earth its produce.
22852	37	1	11	Moreover, I have called for a drought that will affect the fields, the hill country, the grain, new wine, fresh olive oil, and everything that grows from the ground; it also will harm people, animals, and everything they produce.’”
22853	37	1	12	¶Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, along with the whole remnant of the people, obeyed the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God. They responded favorably to the message of the prophet Haggai, who spoke just as the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God had instructed him, and the people began to respect the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22854	37	1	13	Then Haggai, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s messenger, spoke the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s announcement to the people: “I am with you!” decrees the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22855	37	1	14	So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> energized and encouraged Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the whole remnant of the people. They came and worked on the temple of their God, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
22856	37	1	15	This took place on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month of King Darius’ second year.
22857	37	2	1	¶On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came through the prophet Haggai again:
22858	37	2	2	“Ask the following questions to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the remnant of the people:
22859	37	2	3	‘Who among you survivors saw the former splendor of this temple? How does it look to you now? Isn’t it nothing by comparison?’”
22860	37	2	4	“Even so, take heart, Zerubbabel,” decrees the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. “Take heart, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. And take heart all you citizens of the land,” decrees the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “and begin to work. For I am with you,” decrees the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
22861	37	2	5	“Do not fear, because I made a promise to your ancestors when they left Egypt, and my Spirit even now testifies to you.”
22862	37	2	6	Moreover, this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has said: “In just a little while I will once again shake the sky and the earth, the sea and the dry ground.
22863	37	2	7	I will also shake up all the nations, and they will offer their treasures; then I will fill this temple with glory.” So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has said.
22864	37	2	8	“The silver and gold will be mine,” decrees the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
22865	37	2	9	“The future splendor of this temple will be greater than that of former times,” the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has declared. “And in this place I will give peace,” decrees the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.”
22866	37	2	10	¶On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of Darius’ second year, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord’</span>s message came to the prophet Haggai:
22867	37	2	11	“This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has said, ‘Ask the priests about the law.
22868	37	2	12	If someone carries holy meat in a fold of his garment and that fold touches bread, a boiled dish, wine, olive oil, or any other food, will that item become holy?’” The priests answered, “It will not.”
22869	37	2	13	Then Haggai asked, “If a person who is ritually unclean because of touching a dead body comes in contact with one of these items, will it become unclean?” The priests answered, “It will be unclean.”
22870	37	2	14	¶Then Haggai responded, “‘The people of this nation are unclean in my sight,’ decrees the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>. ‘And so is all their effort; everything they offer is also unclean.
22871	37	2	15	Now therefore reflect carefully on the recent past, before one stone was laid on another in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple.
22872	37	2	16	From that time when one came expecting a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten; when one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty measures from it, there were only twenty.
22873	37	2	17	I struck all the products of your labor with blight, disease, and hail, and yet you brought nothing to me,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22874	37	2	18	‘Think carefully about the past: from today, the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, to the day work on the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was resumed, think about it.
22875	37	2	19	The seed is still in the storehouse, isn’t it? And the vine, fig tree, pomegranate, and olive tree have not produced. Nevertheless, from today on I will bless you.’”
22876	37	2	20	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> spoke to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:
22877	37	2	21	Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah: ‘I am ready to shake the sky and the earth.
22878	37	2	22	I will overthrow royal thrones and shatter the might of earthly kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and those who ride them, and horses and their riders will fall as people kill one another.
22879	37	2	23	On that day,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‘I will take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, ‘and I will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.”
22880	38	1	1	¶In the eighth month of Darius’ second year, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message came to the prophet Zechariah, son of Berechiah son of Iddo:
22881	38	1	2	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> was very angry with your ancestors.
22882	38	1	3	Therefore say to the people: The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, “Turn to me,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “and I will turn to you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
22883	38	1	4	“Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the former prophets called out, saying, ‘This is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has said, “Turn now from your evil wickedness,”’ but they would by no means obey me,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22884	38	1	5	“As for your ancestors, where are they? And did the prophets live forever?
22885	38	1	6	But have my words and statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, not outlived your fathers? Then they paid attention and confessed, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has indeed done what he said he would do to us, because of our sinful ways.’”
22886	38	1	7	¶On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month <i>Shebat</i>, in Darius’ second year, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah son of Iddo:
22887	38	1	8	¶I was attentive that night and saw a man seated on a red horse that stood among some myrtle trees in the ravine. Behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
22888	38	1	9	¶Then I asked one nearby, “What are these, sir?” The angelic messenger who replied to me said, “I will show you what these are.”
22889	38	1	10	Then the man standing among the myrtle trees spoke up and said, “These are the ones whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has sent to walk about on the earth.”
22890	38	1	11	The riders then agreed with the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have been walking about on the earth, and now everything is at rest and quiet.”
22891	38	1	12	The angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> then asked, “O <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, how long before you have compassion on Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah which you have been so angry with for these seventy years?”
22892	38	1	13	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> then addressed good, comforting words to the angelic messenger who was speaking to me.
22893	38	1	14	Turning to me, the messenger then said, “Cry out that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘I am very much moved for Jerusalem and for Zion.
22894	38	1	15	But I am greatly displeased with the nations that take my grace for granted. I was a little displeased with them, but they have only made things worse for themselves.
22895	38	1	16	¶“‘Therefore,’ this is what the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> has said, ‘I have become compassionate toward Jerusalem and will rebuild my temple in it,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. ‘Once more a surveyor’s measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.’
22896	38	1	17	Speak up again with the message of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies: ‘My cities will once more overflow with prosperity, and once more the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will comfort Zion and validate his choice of Jerusalem.’”
22897	38	1	18	¶(2:1 ) Once again I looked and this time I saw four horns.
22898	38	1	19	So I asked the angelic messenger who spoke with me, “What are these?” He replied, “These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
22899	38	1	20	Next the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> showed me four blacksmiths.
22900	38	1	21	I asked, “What are these going to do?” He answered, “These horns are the ones that have scattered Judah so that there is no one to be seen. But the blacksmiths have come to terrify Judah’s enemies and cut off the horns of the nations that have thrust themselves against the land of Judah in order to scatter its people.”
22901	38	2	1	¶(2:5 ) I looked again, and there was a man with a measuring line in his hand.
22902	38	2	2	I asked, “Where are you going?” He replied, “To measure Jerusalem in order to determine its width and its length.”
22903	38	2	3	At this point the angelic messenger who spoke to me went out, and another messenger came to meet him
22904	38	2	4	and said to him, “Hurry, speak to this young man as follows: ‘Jerusalem will no longer be enclosed by walls because of the multitude of people and animals there.
22905	38	2	5	But I (the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says) will be a wall of fire surrounding Jerusalem and the source of glory in her midst.’”
22906	38	2	6	¶“You there! Flee from the northland!” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “for like the four winds of heaven I have scattered you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22907	38	2	7	“Escape, Zion, you who live among the Babylonians!”
22908	38	2	8	For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says to me that for his own glory he has sent me to the nations that plundered you – for anyone who touches you touches the pupil of his eye.
22909	38	2	9	“Yes, look here, I am about to punish them so that they will be looted by their own slaves.” Then you will know that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has sent me.
22910	38	2	10	¶“Sing out and be happy, Zion my daughter! For look, I have come; I will settle in your midst,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22911	38	2	11	“Many nations will join themselves to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> on the day of salvation, and they will also be my people. Indeed, I will settle in the midst of you all.” Then you will know that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has sent me to you.
22912	38	2	12	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will take possession of Judah as his portion in the holy land and he will choose Jerusalem once again.
22913	38	2	13	Be silent in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s presence, all people everywhere, for he is being moved to action in his holy dwelling place.
22914	38	3	1	¶Next I saw Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, with Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.
22915	38	3	2	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, “May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> rebuke you, Satan! May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Isn’t this man like a burning stick snatched from the fire?”
22916	38	3	3	Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood there before the angel.
22917	38	3	4	The angel spoke up to those standing all around, “Remove his filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua , “I have freely forgiven your iniquity and will dress you in fine clothing.”
22918	38	3	5	Then I spoke up, “Let a clean turban be put on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> stood nearby.
22919	38	3	6	Then the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> exhorted Joshua solemnly:
22920	38	3	7	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘If you follow my ways and keep my requirements, you will be able to preside over my temple and attend to my courtyards, and I will allow you to come and go among these others who are standing by you.
22921	38	3	8	Listen now, Joshua the high priest, both you and your colleagues who are sitting before you, all of you are a symbol that I am about to introduce my servant, the Branch.
22922	38	3	9	As for the stone I have set before Joshua – on the one stone there are seven eyes. I am about to engrave an inscription on it,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‘to the effect that I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.
22923	38	3	10	In that day,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‘everyone will invite his friend to fellowship under his vine and under his fig tree.’”
22924	38	4	1	¶The angelic messenger who had been speaking with me then returned and woke me, as a person is wakened from sleep.
22925	38	4	2	He asked me, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a menorah of pure gold with a receptacle at the top. There are seven lamps at the top, with seven pipes going to the lamps.
22926	38	4	3	There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the receptacle and the other on the left.”
22927	38	4	4	Then I asked the messenger who spoke with me, “What are these, sir?”
22928	38	4	5	He replied, “Don’t you know what these are?” So I responded, “No, sir.”
22929	38	4	6	Therefore he told me, “This is the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by strength and not by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.”
22930	38	4	7	¶“What are you, you great mountain? Because of Zerubbabel you will become a level plain! And he will bring forth the temple capstone with shoutings of ‘Grace! Grace!’ because of this.”
22931	38	4	8	Moreover, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message came to me as follows:
22932	38	4	9	“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations of this temple, and his hands will complete it.” Then you will know that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has sent me to you.
22933	38	4	10	For who dares make light of small beginnings? These seven eyes will joyfully look on the tin tablet in Zerubbabel’s hand. (These are the eyes of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, which constantly range across the whole earth.)
22934	38	4	11	¶Next I asked the messenger, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the menorah?”
22935	38	4	12	Before he could reply I asked again, “What are these two extensions of the olive trees, which are emptying out the golden oil through the two golden pipes?”
22936	38	4	13	He replied, “Don’t you know what these are?” And I said, “No, sir.”
22937	38	4	14	So he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”
22938	38	5	1	¶Then I turned to look, and there was a flying scroll!
22939	38	5	2	Someone asked me, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a flying scroll thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide.”
22940	38	5	3	The speaker went on to say, “This is a curse traveling across the whole earth. For example, according to the curse whoever steals will be removed from the community; or on the other hand (according to the curse) whoever swears falsely will suffer the same fate.”
22941	38	5	4	“I will send it out,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “and it will enter the house of the thief and of the person who swears falsely in my name. It will land in the middle of his house and destroy both timber and stones.”
22942	38	5	5	¶After this the angelic messenger who had been speaking to me went out and said, “Look, see what is leaving.”
22943	38	5	6	I asked, “What is it?” And he replied, “It is a basket for measuring grain that is moving away from here.” Moreover, he said, “This is their ‘eye’ throughout all the earth.”
22944	38	5	7	Then a round lead cover was raised up, revealing a woman sitting inside the basket.
22945	38	5	8	He then said, “This woman represents wickedness,” and he pushed her down into the basket and placed the lead cover on top.
22946	38	5	9	Then I looked again and saw two women going forth with the wind in their wings (they had wings like those of a stork) and they lifted up the basket between the earth and the sky.
22947	38	5	10	I asked the messenger who was speaking to me, “Where are they taking the basket?”
22948	38	5	11	He replied, “To build a temple for her in the land of Babylonia. When it is finished, she will be placed there in her own residence.”
22949	38	6	1	¶Once more I looked, and this time I saw four chariots emerging from between two mountains of bronze.
22950	38	6	2	Harnessed to the first chariot were red horses, to the second black horses,
22951	38	6	3	to the third white horses, and to the fourth spotted horses, all of them strong.
22952	38	6	4	Then I asked the angelic messenger who was speaking with me, “What are these, sir?”
22953	38	6	5	The messenger replied, “These are the four spirits of heaven going out after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth.
22954	38	6	6	The chariot with the black horses is going to the north country, and the white ones are going after them, but the spotted ones are going to the south country.
22955	38	6	7	All these strong ones are scattering; they have sought permission to go and walk about over the earth.” The Lord had said, “Go! Walk about over the earth!” So they are doing so.
22956	38	6	8	Then he cried out to me, “Look! The ones going to the northland have brought me peace about the northland.”
22957	38	6	9	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message came to me as follows:
22958	38	6	10	“Choose some people from among the exiles, namely, Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, all of whom have come from Babylon, and when you have done so go to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
22959	38	6	11	Then take some silver and gold to make a crown and set it on the head of Joshua the high priest, the son of Jehozadak.
22960	38	6	12	Then say to him, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, “Look – here is the man whose name is Branch, who will sprout up from his place and build the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22961	38	6	13	Indeed, he will build the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> and he will be clothed in splendor, sitting as king on his throne. Moreover, there will be a priest with him on his throne and they will see eye to eye on everything.
22962	38	6	14	The crown will then be turned over to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
22963	38	6	15	Then those who are far away will come and build the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> so that you may know that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has sent me to you. This will all come to pass if you completely obey the voice of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> your God.”’”
22964	38	7	1	¶In King Darius’ fourth year, on the fourth day of Kislev, the ninth month, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message came to Zechariah.
22965	38	7	2	Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melech and their companions to seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s favor
22966	38	7	3	by asking both the priests of the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies and the prophets, “Should we weep in the fifth month, fasting as we have done over the years?”
22967	38	7	4	The message of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies then came to me,
22968	38	7	5	“Speak to all the people and priests of the land as follows: ‘When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and seventh months through all these seventy years, did you truly fast for me – for me, indeed?
22969	38	7	6	And now when you eat and drink, are you not doing so for yourselves?’”
22970	38	7	7	Should you not have obeyed the words that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> cried out through the former prophets when Jerusalem was peacefully inhabited and her surrounding cities, the Negev, and the foothills were also populated?
22971	38	7	8	¶Again the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message came to Zechariah:
22972	38	7	9	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies said, ‘Exercise true judgment and show brotherhood and compassion to each other.
22973	38	7	10	You must not oppress the widow, the orphan, the resident foreigner, or the poor, nor should anyone secretly plot evil against his fellow citizen.’
22974	38	7	11	¶“But they refused to pay attention, turning away stubbornly and stopping their ears so they could not hear.
22975	38	7	12	Indeed, they made their hearts as hard as diamond, so that they could not obey the Torah and the other words the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies had poured out great wrath.
22976	38	7	13	¶“‘It then came about that just as I cried out, but they would not obey, so they will cry out, but I will not listen,’ the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies had said.
22977	38	7	14	‘Rather, I will sweep them away in a storm into all the nations they are not familiar with.’ Thus the land had become desolate because of them, with no one crossing through or returning, for they had made the fruitful land a waste.”
22978	38	8	1	¶Then the message of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies came to me as follows:
22979	38	8	2	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘I am very much concerned for Zion; indeed, I am so concerned for her that my rage will fall on those who hurt her.’
22980	38	8	3	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> says, ‘I have returned to Zion and will live within Jerusalem. Now Jerusalem will be called “truthful city,” “mountain of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,” “holy mountain.”’
22981	38	8	4	Moreover, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘Old men and women will once more live in the plazas of Jerusalem, each one leaning on a cane because of advanced age.
22982	38	8	5	And the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing.
22983	38	8	6	And,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‘though such a thing may seem to be difficult in the opinion of the small community of those days, will it also appear difficult to me?’ asks the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
22984	38	8	7	¶“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies asserts, ‘I am about to save my people from the lands of the east and the west.
22985	38	8	8	And I will bring them to settle within Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and righteousness.’
22986	38	8	9	¶“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies also says, ‘Gather strength, you who are listening to these words today from the mouths of the prophets who were there at the founding of the house of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, so that the temple might be built.
22987	38	8	10	Before that time there was no compensation for man or animal, nor was there any relief from adversity for those who came and went, because I had pitted everybody – each one – against everyone else.
22988	38	8	11	But I will be different now to this remnant of my people from the way I was in those days,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,
22989	38	8	12	‘for there will be a peaceful time of sowing, the vine will produce its fruit, and the ground its yield, and the skies will rain down dew. Then I will allow the remnant of my people to possess all these things.
22990	38	8	13	And it will come about that just as you (both Judah and Israel) were a curse to the nations, so I will save you and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid! Instead, be strong!’
22991	38	8	14	¶“For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘As I had planned to hurt you when your fathers made me angry,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, ‘and I was not sorry,
22992	38	8	15	so, to the contrary, I have planned in these days to do good to Jerusalem and Judah – do not fear!
22993	38	8	16	These are the things you must do: Speak the truth, each of you, to one another. Practice true and righteous judgment in your courts.
22994	38	8	17	Do not plan evil in your hearts against one another. Do not favor a false oath – these are all things that I hate,’ says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord.</span>
22995	38	8	18	¶The message of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies came to me as follows:
22996	38	8	19	“The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘The fast of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will become joyful and happy, pleasant feasts for the house of Judah, so love truth and peace.’
22997	38	8	20	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘It will someday come to pass that people – residents of many cities – will come.
22998	38	8	21	The inhabitants of one will go to another and say, “Let’s go up at once to ask the favor of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, to seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. Indeed, I’ll go with you.”’
22999	38	8	22	Many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies and to ask his favor.
23000	38	8	23	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘In those days ten people from all languages and nations will grasp hold of – indeed, grab – the robe of one Jew and say, “Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”’”
23001	38	9	1	¶This is an oracle, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message concerning the land of Hadrach, with its focus on Damascus: ¶The eyes of all humanity, especially of the tribes of Israel, are toward the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,
23002	38	9	2	as are those of Hamath also, which adjoins Damascus, and Tyre and Sidon, though they consider themselves to be very wise.
23003	38	9	3	Tyre built herself a fortification and piled up silver like dust and gold like the mud of the streets!
23004	38	9	4	Nevertheless the Lord will evict her and shove her fortifications into the sea – she will be consumed by fire.
23005	38	9	5	Ashkelon will see and be afraid; Gaza will be in great anguish, as will Ekron, for her hope will have been dried up. Gaza will lose her king, and Ashkelon will no longer be inhabited.
23006	38	9	6	A mongrel people will live in Ashdod, for I will greatly humiliate the Philistines.
23007	38	9	7	I will take away their abominable religious practices; then those who survive will become a community of believers in our God, like a clan in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
23008	38	9	8	Then I will surround my temple to protect it like a guard from anyone crossing back and forth; so no one will cross over against them anymore as an oppressor, for now I myself have seen it.
23009	38	9	9	‡Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!‡Shout, daughter of Jerusalem!‡Look! Your king is coming to you:‡he is legitimate and victorious, ‡humble and riding on a donkey – ‡on a young donkey, the foal of a female donkey.
23010	38	9	10	‡I will remove the chariot from Ephraim‡and the warhorse from Jerusalem,‡and the battle bow will be removed.‡Then he will announce peace to the nations.‡His dominion will be from sea to sea‡and from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.
23011	38	9	11	¶Moreover, as for you, because of our covenant relationship secured with blood, I will release your prisoners from the waterless pit.
23012	38	9	12	Return to the stronghold, you prisoners, with hope; today I declare that I will return double what was taken from you.
23013	38	9	13	I will bend Judah as my bow; I will load the bow with Ephraim, my arrow! I will stir up your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, and I will make you, Zion, like a warrior’s sword.
23014	38	9	14	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will appear above them, and his arrow will shoot forth like lightning; the Sovereign <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will blow the trumpet and will proceed in the southern storm winds.
23015	38	9	15	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will guard them, and they will prevail and overcome with sling stones. Then they will drink, and will become noisy like drunkards, full like the sacrificial basin or like the corners of the altar.
23016	38	9	16	On that day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God will deliver them as the flock of his people, for they are the precious stones of a crown sparkling over his land.
23017	38	9	17	How precious and fair! Grain will make the young men flourish and new wine the young women.
23018	38	10	1	¶Ask the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> for rain in the season of the late spring rains – the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> who causes thunderstorms – and he will give everyone showers of rain and green growth in the field.
23019	38	10	2	For the household gods have spoken wickedness, the soothsayers have seen a lie, and as for the dreamers, they have disclosed emptiness and give comfort in vain. Therefore the people set out like sheep and become scattered because they have no shepherd.
23020	38	10	3	I am enraged at the shepherds and will punish the lead-goats.¶For the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has brought blessing to his flock, the house of Judah, and will transform them into his majestic warhorse.
23021	38	10	4	From him will come the cornerstone, the wall peg, the battle bow, and every ruler.
23022	38	10	5	And they will be like warriors trampling the mud of the streets in battle. They will fight, for the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be with them, and will defeat the enemy cavalry.
23023	38	10	6	¶“I (says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>) will strengthen the kingdom of Judah and deliver the people of Joseph and will bring them back because of my compassion for them. They will be as though I had never rejected them, for I am the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> their God and therefore I will hear them.
23024	38	10	7	The Ephraimites will be like warriors and will rejoice as if they had drunk wine. Their children will see it and rejoice; they will celebrate in the things of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
23025	38	10	8	I will signal for them and gather them, for I have already redeemed them; then they will become as numerous as they were before.
23026	38	10	9	Though I scatter them among the nations, they will remember in far-off places – they and their children will survive and return.
23027	38	10	10	I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to the lands of Gilead and Lebanon, and there will not be enough room for them.
23028	38	10	11	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will cross the sea of storms and will calm its turbulence. The depths of the Nile will dry up, the pride of Assyria will be humbled, and the domination of Egypt will be no more.
23029	38	10	12	Thus I will strengthen them by my power, and they will walk about in my name,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
23030	38	11	1	‡Open your gates, Lebanon,‡so that the fire may consume your cedars.
23031	38	11	2	‡Howl, fir tree,‡because the cedar has fallen;‡the majestic trees have been destroyed.‡Howl, oaks of Bashan,‡because the impenetrable forest has fallen.
23032	38	11	3	‡Listen to the howling of shepherds,‡because their magnificence has been destroyed.‡Listen to the roaring of young lions,‡because the thickets of the Jordan have been devastated.
23033	38	11	4	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God says this: “Shepherd the flock set aside for slaughter.
23034	38	11	5	Those who buy them slaughter them and are not held guilty; those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, for I am rich.’ Their own shepherds have no compassion for them.
23035	38	11	6	Indeed, I will no longer have compassion on the people of the land,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “but instead I will turn every last person over to his neighbor and his king. They will devastate the land, and I will not deliver it from them.”
23036	38	11	7	¶So I began to shepherd the flock destined for slaughter, the most afflicted of all the flock. Then I took two staffs, calling one “Pleasantness” and the other “Union,” and I tended the flock.
23037	38	11	8	Next I eradicated the three shepherds in one month, for I ran out of patience with them and, indeed, they detested me as well.
23038	38	11	9	I then said, “I will not shepherd you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be eradicated, let it be eradicated. As for those who survive, let them eat each other’s flesh!”
23039	38	11	10	¶Then I took my staff “Pleasantness” and cut it in two to annul my covenant that I had made with all the people.
23040	38	11	11	So it was annulled that very day, and then the most afflicted of the flock who kept faith with me knew that it was the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message.
23041	38	11	12	¶Then I said to them, “If it seems good to you, pay me my wages, but if not, forget it.” So they weighed out my payment – thirty pieces of silver.
23042	38	11	13	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> then said to me, “Throw to the potter that exorbitant sum at which they valued me!” So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the temple of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
23043	38	11	14	Then I cut the second staff “Union” in two in order to annul the covenant of brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
23044	38	11	15	¶Again the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Take up once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
23045	38	11	16	Indeed, I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not take heed to the sheep headed to slaughter, will not seek the scattered, and will not heal the injured. Moreover, he will not nourish the one that is healthy but instead will eat the meat of the fat sheep and tear off their hooves.
23046	38	11	17	‡Woe to the worthless shepherd‡who abandons the flock!‡May a sword fall on his arm and his right eye!‡May his arm wither completely away,‡and his right eye become completely blind!”
23047	38	12	1	¶This is an oracle, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message concerning Israel: The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> – he who stretches out the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth, who forms the human spirit within a person – says,
23048	38	12	2	“I am about to make Jerusalem a cup that brings dizziness to all the surrounding nations; indeed, Judah will also be included when Jerusalem is besieged.
23049	38	12	3	Moreover, on that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy burden for all the nations, and all who try to carry it will be seriously injured; yet all the peoples of the earth will be assembled against it.
23050	38	12	4	On that day,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “I will strike every horse with confusion and its rider with madness. I will pay close attention to the house of Judah, but will strike all the horses of the nations with blindness.
23051	38	12	5	Then the leaders of Judah will say to themselves, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are a means of strength to us through their God, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.’
23052	38	12	6	On that day I will make the leaders of Judah like an igniter among sticks and a burning torch among sheaves, and they will burn up all the surrounding nations right and left. Then the people of Jerusalem will settle once more in their place, the city of Jerusalem.
23053	38	12	7	The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> also will deliver the homes of Judah first, so that the splendor of the kingship of David and of the people of Jerusalem may not exceed that of Judah.
23054	38	12	8	On that day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> himself will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the weakest among them will be like mighty David, and the dynasty of David will be like God, like the angel of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> before them.
23055	38	12	9	So on that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.”
23056	38	12	10	¶“I will pour out on the kingship of David and the population of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication so that they will look to me, the one they have pierced. They will lament for him as one laments for an only son, and there will be a bitter cry for him like the bitter cry for a firstborn.
23057	38	12	11	On that day the lamentation in Jerusalem will be as great as the lamentation at Hadad-Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
23058	38	12	12	The land will mourn, each clan by itself – the clan of the royal household of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the clan of the family of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves;
23059	38	12	13	the clan of the descendants of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; and the clan of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves –
23060	38	12	14	all the clans that remain, each separately with their wives.”
23061	38	13	1	¶“In that day there will be a fountain opened up for the dynasty of David and the people of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
23062	38	13	2	And also on that day,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “I will remove the names of the idols from the land and they will never again be remembered. Moreover, I will remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.
23063	38	13	3	Then, if anyone prophesies in spite of this, his father and mother to whom he was born will say to him, ‘You cannot live, for you lie in the name of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.’Then his father and mother to whom he was born will run him through with a sword when he prophesies.
23064	38	13	4	¶“Therefore, on that day each prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies and will no longer wear the hairy garment of a prophet to deceive the people.
23065	38	13	5	Instead he will say, ‘I am no prophet – indeed, I am a farmer, for a man has made me his indentured servant since my youth.’
23066	38	13	6	Then someone will ask him, ‘What are these wounds on your chest?’ and he will answer, ‘Some that I received in the house of my friends.’
23067	38	13	7	‡“Awake, sword, against my shepherd,‡against the man who is my associate,”‡says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.‡Strike the shepherd that the flock may be scattered; ‡I will turn my hand against the insignificant ones.
23068	38	13	8	‡It will happen in all the land, says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>,‡that two-thirds of the people in it will be cut off and die,‡but one-third will be left in it.
23069	38	13	9	‡Then I will bring the remaining third into the fire;‡I will refine them like silver is refined‡and will test them like gold is tested.‡They will call on my name and I will answer;‡I will say, ‘These are my people,’‡and they will say, ‘The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is my God.’”
23070	38	14	1	¶A day of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is about to come when your possessions will be divided as plunder in your midst.
23071	38	14	2	For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to wage war; the city will be taken, its houses plundered, and the women raped. Then half of the city will go into exile, but the remainder of the people will not be taken away.
23072	38	14	3	¶Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will go to battle and fight against those nations, just as he fought battles in ancient days.
23073	38	14	4	On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which lies to the east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in half from east to west, leaving a great valley. Half the mountain will move northward and the other half southward.
23074	38	14	5	Then you will escape through my mountain valley, for the valley of the mountains will extend to Azal. Indeed, you will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah. Then the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> my God will come with all his holy ones with him.
23075	38	14	6	On that day there will be no light – the sources of light in the heavens will congeal.
23076	38	14	7	It will happen in one day (a day known to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>); not in the day or the night, but in the evening there will be light.
23077	38	14	8	Moreover, on that day living waters will flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea; it will happen both in summer and in winter.
23078	38	14	9	¶The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will then be king over all the earth. In that day the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will be seen as one with a single name.
23079	38	14	10	All the land will change and become like the rift valley from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be raised up and will stay in its own place from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate and on to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.
23080	38	14	11	And people will settle there, and there will no longer be the threat of divine extermination – Jerusalem will dwell in security.
23081	38	14	12	¶But this will be the nature of the plague with which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> will strike all the nations that have fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will decay while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot away in their sockets, and their tongues will dissolve in their mouths.
23082	38	14	13	On that day there will be great confusion from the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> among them; they will seize each other and attack one another violently.
23083	38	14	14	Moreover, Judah will fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered up – gold, silver, and clothing in great abundance.
23084	38	14	15	This is the kind of plague that will devastate horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the other animals in those camps.
23085	38	14	16	¶Then all who survive from all the nations that came to attack Jerusalem will go up annually to worship the King, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, and to observe the Feast of Shelters.
23086	38	14	17	But if any of the nations anywhere on earth refuse to go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, they will get no rain.
23087	38	14	18	If the Egyptians will not do so, they will get no rain – instead there will be the kind of plague which the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> inflicts on any nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Shelters.
23088	38	14	19	This will be the punishment of Egypt and of all nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Shelters.
23089	38	14	20	¶On that day the bells of the horses will bear the inscription “<span class=\"smcaps\">Holy to the Lord</span>.” The cooking pots in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s temple will be as holy as the bowls in front of the altar.
23090	38	14	21	Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah will become holy in the sight of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, so that all who offer sacrifices may come and use some of them to boil their sacrifices in them. On that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23091	39	1	1	¶This is an oracle, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s message to Israel through Malachi:
23092	39	1	2	¶“I have shown love to you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord,</span> but you say, “How have you shown love to us?” ¶“Esau was Jacob’s brother,” the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> explains, “yet I chose Jacob
23093	39	1	3	and rejected Esau. I turned Esau’s mountains into a deserted wasteland and gave his territory to the wild jackals.”
23094	39	1	4	¶Edom says, “Though we are devastated, we will once again build the ruined places.” So the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies responds, “They indeed may build, but I will overthrow. They will be known as the land of evil, the people with whom the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is permanently displeased.
23095	39	1	5	Your eyes will see it, and then you will say, ‘May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> be magnified even beyond the border of Israel!’”
23096	39	1	6	¶“A son naturally honors his father and a slave respects his master. If I am your father, where is my honor? If I am your master, where is my respect? The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies asks you this, you priests who make light of my name! But you reply, ‘How have we made light of your name?’
23097	39	1	7	You are offering improper sacrifices on my altar, yet you ask, ‘How have we offended you?’ By treating the table of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as if it is of no importance!
23098	39	1	8	For when you offer blind animals as a sacrifice, is that not wrong? And when you offer the lame and sick, is that not wrong as well? Indeed, try offering them to your governor! Will he be pleased with you or show you favor?” asks the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23099	39	1	9	But now plead for God’s favor that he might be gracious to us. “With this kind of offering in your hands, how can he be pleased with you?” asks the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23100	39	1	10	¶“I wish that one of you would close the temple doors, so that you no longer would light useless fires on my altar. I am not pleased with you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “and I will no longer accept an offering from you.
23101	39	1	11	For from the east to the west my name will be great among the nations. Incense and pure offerings will be offered in my name everywhere, for my name will be great among the nations,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23102	39	1	12	“But you are profaning it by saying that the table of the Lord is common and its offerings despicable.
23103	39	1	13	You also say, ‘How tiresome it is.’ You turn up your nose at it,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “and instead bring what is stolen, lame, or sick. You bring these things for an offering! Should I accept this from you?” asks the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>.
23104	39	1	14	“There will be harsh condemnation for the hypocrite who has a valuable male animal in his flock but vows and sacrifices something inferior to the Lord. For I am a great king,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “and my name is awesome among the nations.”
23105	39	2	1	¶“Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.
23106	39	2	2	If you do not listen and take seriously the need to honor my name,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “I will send judgment on you and turn your blessings into curses – indeed, I have already done so because you are not taking it to heart.
23107	39	2	3	I am about to discipline your children and will spread offal on your faces, the very offal produced at your festivals, and you will be carried away along with it.
23108	39	2	4	Then you will know that I sent this commandment to you so that my covenant may continue to be with Levi,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23109	39	2	5	“My covenant with him was designed to bring life and peace. I gave its statutes to him to fill him with awe, and he indeed revered me and stood in awe before me.
23110	39	2	6	He taught what was true; sinful words were not found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and integrity, and he turned many people away from sin.
23111	39	2	7	For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge of sacred things, and people should seek instruction from him because he is the messenger of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23112	39	2	8	You, however, have turned from the way. You have caused many to violate the law; you have corrupted the covenant with Levi,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23113	39	2	9	“Therefore, I have caused you to be ignored and belittled before all people to the extent to which you are not following after me and are showing partiality in your instruction.”
23114	39	2	10	¶Do we not all have one father? Did not one God create us? Why do we betray one another, in this way making light of the covenant of our ancestors?
23115	39	2	11	Judah has become disloyal, and unspeakable sins have been committed in Israel and Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the holy things that the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> loves and has turned to a foreign god!
23116	39	2	12	May the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> cut off from the community of Jacob every last person who does this, as well as the person who presents improper offerings to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies!
23117	39	2	13	¶You also do this: You cover the altar of the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with tears as you weep and groan, because he no longer pays any attention to the offering nor accepts it favorably from you.
23118	39	2	14	Yet you ask, “Why?” The <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> is testifying against you on behalf of the wife you married when you were young, to whom you have become unfaithful even though she is your companion and wife by law.
23119	39	2	15	No one who has even a small portion of the Spirit in him does this. What did our ancestor do when seeking a child from God? Be attentive, then, to your own spirit, for one should not be disloyal to the wife he took in his youth.
23120	39	2	16	“I hate divorce,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, “and the one who is guilty of violence,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. “Pay attention to your conscience, and do not be unfaithful.”
23121	39	2	17	¶You have wearied the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> with your words. But you say, “How have we wearied him?” Because you say, “Everyone who does evil is good in the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>’s opinion, and he delights in them,” or “Where is the God of justice?”
23122	39	3	1	“I am about to send my messenger, who will clear the way before me. Indeed, the Lord you are seeking will suddenly come to his temple, and the messenger of the covenant, whom you long for, is certainly coming,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23123	39	3	2	¶Who can endure the day of his coming? Who can keep standing when he appears? For he will be like a refiner’s fire, like a launderer’s soap.
23124	39	3	3	He will act like a refiner and purifier of silver and will cleanse the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will offer the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> a proper offering.
23125	39	3	4	The offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> as in former times and years past.
23126	39	3	5	¶“I will come to you in judgment. I will be quick to testify against those who practice divination, those who commit adultery, those who break promises, and those who exploit workers, widows, and orphans, who refuse to help the resident foreigner and in this way show they do not fear me,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23127	39	3	6	¶“Since, I, the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, do not go back on my promises, you, sons of Jacob, have not perished.
23128	39	3	7	From the days of your ancestors you have ignored my commandments and have not kept them! Return to me, and I will return to you,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. “But you say, ‘How should we return?’
23129	39	3	8	Can a person rob God? You indeed are robbing me, but you say, ‘How are we robbing you?’ In tithes and contributions!
23130	39	3	9	You are bound for judgment because you are robbing me – this whole nation is guilty.
23131	39	3	10	¶“Bring the entire tithe into the storehouse so that there may be food in my temple. Test me in this matter,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “to see if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it all.
23132	39	3	11	Then I will stop the plague from ruining your crops, and the vine will not lose its fruit before harvest,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23133	39	3	12	“All nations will call you happy, for you indeed will live in a delightful land,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.
23134	39	3	13	¶“You have criticized me sharply,” says the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span>, “but you ask, ‘How have we criticized you?’
23135	39	3	14	You have said, ‘It is useless to serve God. How have we been helped by keeping his requirements and going about like mourners before the <span class=\"smcaps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies?
23136	39	3	15	So now we consider the arrogant to be happy; indeed, those who practice evil are successful. In fact, those who challenge God escape!’”
